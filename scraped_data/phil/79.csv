5,"My boyfriend and I have been dying to try the breakfast egg sandwich from here, but unfortunately he never wakes up early enough . We did get the chance to try two of their sandwiches - the So Long Sal and the Phoagie.

Let&apos;s start with the bread. The roll was a sesame roll. It was soft and had the right amount of crisp and toast giving you your best sandwich experience. 

The So Long Sal was delicious. The arugula on the sandwich made the sandwich lighter and refreshing. The house dressing gave the sandwich a nice little kick. Beware it was a bit messy and required a lot of napkins!

The Phoagie was definitely unique and different than any typical sandwich that we would order. The eggplant was soft and the fried onions gave the overall concept of the sandwich a nice crunch. The cilantro was perfect to mask the sweet and tangy-ness of the sandwich. The avocado overall helped to balance out the overall sandwich. I felt that there was a bit too much hoisin sauce in the sandwich overall, but still delicious.

The best part of these two sandwiches were that it was quite satisfying. Again, multiple napkins required as both sandwiches were a bit messy towards the end, but highly recommend! We&apos;ll be back again, but this time for breakfast"
5,"WHAT WE GOT: Egg breakfast sandwich &amp; the herschel

PROS: delicious buttery bread with honestly the fluffiest egg I&apos;ve ever had in my life. The flavor combinations were amazing and very well thought out considering the egg sandwich needed that arugula to contrast all that richness. The herschel was the star of the meal though. That corned beef was truly a chefs kiss moment and paired beautifully with the egg in between the rye. The portion size was just big enough to fill us up for probably the next several hours so I&apos;d say this is more of a brunch type meal.

CONS: the bread did get a bit soggy but I&apos;m chalking it up to the fact that it was take out/delivery and there&apos;s no helping it right now since you can&apos;t really eat it while it&apos;s super fresh."
5,"TY to whoever runs the Middle Child IG page for content so great that it convinced this typically meh about sandwiches girl to give their sandos a try. 

Based off previous reviews we went with the So Long Sal and Shopsin Club. The So Long Sal was good, but a bit on the salty and gloopy side for my liking. If you like salami, you&apos;ll probably be a fan of this one.  The Shopsin Club was what really sealed the deal and made me a Middle Child fan 4 life. With each bite I literally heard myself going, &apos;MMmMmm&apos; lol. The mix of sweet and savory is just right and I loved that the bread stayed perfectly crusty (while not being too crusty) even after our 20 min trek through downtown to find the perfect picnic spot. 

Their online ordering system is easy to use. Only thing to consider is that you don&apos;t have the option to set a pick up time, so be flexible to pick it up whenever it&apos;s ready. We ordered once on a weekend and it was up to an hour long wait, but another time on a weekday for lunch it was only 20 minutes. To make life easier, you can call ahead and they&apos;ll gladly let you know what the estimated wait time is."
5,"A sandwich shop named Middle Child?! A place that would perfectly describe me in a nutshell? Am I dreaming? I&apos;ve pinched myself enough times to confirm I was not. 

The sandwiches here are BOMB. I am not even exaggerating. You get an explosion of flavors with every bite. The shopsin club and josh miller&apos;s &quot;not italian&quot; were amazing. Sandwiches aren&apos;t super long, but they were thick. They really packed each one with meat. The shopsin club was one of my favorites. I mean, cranberry miso mayo? Like who comes up with this genius stuff?? Very creamy and epic sandwich. You will get full easily. Make sure you place your order online and don&apos;t sleep on this amazing sandwich joint!"
4,"First time at Middle Child and I ordered the Shopsin Club sandwich! The bread, avocado, bacon, turkey, cranberry miso sauce - they were all such a great combo. The bread sold it for me. Not to mention that the sandwich was stuffed with turkey! Definitely worth it for the price! 

I would rate it a 4.5 stars. The wait was long. We waited 45 mins for 2 sandwiches  Definitely order online in advance before you make your way to the shop! 

Highly recommend giving this sandwich shop a try regardless of the wait time! I&apos;ll definitely come back to try a different sandwich!"
4,"Poppin sandwich spot in center city!

Quick in &amp; out approach (minimal seating - average wait during peak breakfast time is like 25/30 minutes.

Menu is great, could have a little more diverse/adventurous options. The Shopsin Club sandwich is on another level, as well as So Long Sal (get the special - &quot;bye Fleicia&quot; - veggie version.)

Being in the restaurant is like stepping in a time machine inside - 60&apos;s/70&apos;s theme &amp; store products."
4,"A friend raved about this place, so I came to try the sandwiches! 

Overall, their bread is high quality but very crusty, so biting/chewing is a little difficult! The sandwiches are also huuuge, so I could only finish half for a meal. They don&apos;t like substitutions or leaving stuff out, which really shows how particular they are about the flavor combinations! I&apos;m sure they spent a while cooking up these sandwiches, therefore the taste of them are very unique! I know they have good vegetarian options, so I&apos;ll come back and try those next time."
5,"Middle Child is one of my favorite places in the city for a sandwich. It has a great classic deli vibe inside, and (when it&apos;s safe) it&apos;s great to sit at the bar and eat. They have the fluffiest eggs on earth, and if you want a pro tip, get hash brown INSIDE your breakfast sandwich!

For lunch, my choices are either the So Long Sal or the Shopsin Club. The Sal is like an Italian hoagie, but unlike any other hoagie you&apos;ve have before. And the Shopsin is a fantastic turkey club on ciabatta bread. I&apos;m getting hungry just writing this, so need to grab a sandwich again soon!"
4,"When we saw the Rupert Grint comment about Middle Child, it bumped it way up on our list! While we originally heard of the restaurant for their lunch sandwiches, we were also very intrigued by their breakfast options, so we wound up placing an order for brunch. The entire menu is pretty limited, which always tells me that what they do, they do well. That being said, the breakfast menu consists of just 2 sandwiches, making our decision very easy. These guys are only available on the weekends and only for a few short hours, so be sure to place your order before the time runs out! To order, you must download the Middle Child app, which is just a minor inconvenience for obtaining the food. We placed an order and received word that our food would be ready within 30 minutes, so a very quick turnaround! The shop is closed to customers, but we easily retrieved our order once we arrived. 
In terms of food, as mentioned, just 2 breakfast options - the breakfast sandwich and the Hershel sandwich - so I got the breakfast and my fiancee the Hershel, and we split. Since we had walked ~20 minutes home with the sandwiches, we expected them to be a bit soggy and less crisp as if we would have enjoyed while there. The sogginess honestly wasn&apos;t too bad, but my sandwich did lose its integrity a little bit. However, it certainly didn&apos;t compromise the taste! The OG sandwich features the most fluffy eggs I have ever had, a nice sharp cheddar, and some arugula, all in cased by potato bread. I haven&apos;t had potato bread since I was a child, so this was a nice throwback and matched well with the contents. The egg was SO good, so light and fluffy but also so substantial, and the cheese was perfectly melted as a great accompaniment. A basic, but very well done sandwich. The Hershel was definitely the star though - featuring rye bread as the base, it enclosed corned beef and that same fluffy egg, as well as the sharp cheddar. The beef stole the show and made for an unforgettable and unique sandwich. I definitely wish I also would have ordered this one! 
Overall, we really enjoyed our Middle Child breakfast experience. The eggs were the fluffiest we&apos;ve had, and the flavors were very intentionally paired in both sandwiches. We can&apos;t wait to try again for lunch someday! Thanks Middle Child, and thanks Rupert Grint for re-sparking our interest!"
5,One of my favorite sandwiches I&apos;ve had! I love that they also have great gluten-free bread. They were very accommodating and friendly as well.
4,"Having bad luck lately with finding hair in food. My husband found hair--2 separate strands to be specific--on his sandwich wrapper. Kinda gross!! (It&apos;s nasty finding hair in food even without a pandemic)

GREAT sandwiches though. Finally tried the breakfast sandwich, and it&apos;s amazing. Also tried the hash brown--thick and crispy. A tad saltier than I would&apos;ve preferred but not a dealbreaker.

I&apos;ll also add that Middle Child has been taking covid seriously since the pandemic started with their contactless system and having customers wait outside. 

See my previous reviews for sandwich recommendations."
5,"I&apos;ll start this review by saying I am not a big sandwich guy - something about bread overpowering what&apos;s between the bread just makes no sense to me. If you&apos;ve found yourself on this page, chances are you definitely disagree with me. Nonetheless, I might not be a big sandwich guy, but Middle Child makes me want to be.

Ordered pickup on their website midweek around lunchtime. Went with a Court Street&apos;s Reuben on a hoagie and a Baller Classic on a hoagie. The wait wasn&apos;t too long, and their website time estimate was on point for pickup which was really helpful for planning my arrival. One suggestion - plan ahead when you order - this is a VERY popular and busy shop that has been kicking butt during covid! Even if the wait time is longer than you expected - it is worth every second. I knew that I wanted my food in 45 mins to an hour, so I ordered accordingly. There have also been days where they temporarily turn off online ordering because they&apos;re swamped - check back on their website periodically or check their Instagram story for updates! A little planning goes a long way!!

Now for the food - the reuben was without a doubt the best reuben I&apos;ve ever had - the short rib corned beef was INSANE, and the kraut, sauce, and cheese were perfect. The Baller was also great - something about the combo of mayo, pickles, and red onions made it extra special.

Super excited I was finally able to get takeout from MC and will definitely do so again soon. Next time, I&apos;m looking forward to their egg sandwiches!"
4,"I&apos;m not a huge sandwich fan, but this is one of my go-to reliable spots in Philadelphia. I&apos;ve only had their lunch sandwiches for takeout, but they&apos;ve all been good. They have a limited menu, but their options are creative and tasty. Would definitely recommend it for a quick bite. I ordered online and picked up in person, and they were quick."
5,"I&apos;ve been enraptured with Middle Child since my first bite of a Shopsin Club back in 2019. Many sandwiches later, this I know: MC always gets it right. They&apos;re a modern sandwich spot but very much old school-inspired. Whatever leaves their kitchen is always made with love and top-notch ingredients.

They&apos;re slinging top tier breakfast sandwiches starring the fluffiest, thickest eggs and featuring melty cooper sharp and peppy arugula, all sandwiched between crunchy, buttery toast. Crispy hash brown blocks are a worthy sandwich addition 10/10 times.

And the homemade roasted turkey sandwiches are guaranteed to make you go nnnnngh. The Shopsin Club, Surfer, reuben, and Baller Classic are all craveably delicious and properly stacked. Cranberry miso mayo, blueberry masala jam, mandolin-thin pickles, and other special touches add savory and sweet notes and make each simply unforgettable.

The short rib corned beef reuben is up there with Famous and Herschel&apos;s for me -- the meat is meltingly tender! The &quot;vegan by chance&quot; Phoagie filled with hoisin-painted eggplant excites me EVEN when I want to eat meat. The So Long Sal is an epic rendition of an Italian hoagie that includes piquant artichoke spread and creamy house dressing. The flavors just really pop &apos;n sing. Specials are always tasty, fun and inspired, too.

Bread sourcing is of the highest quality. Long rolls are from Sarcone&apos;s. Ciabatta is from Merzbacher&apos;s. Mayo is Duke&apos;s, slathered joyfully.

Also worth mentioning is that during the pandemic, MC has truly been a light. They&apos;ve maintained the same level of quality while taking safety precautions seriously. They care about the community and always have. And they care about what&apos;s right. If you&apos;ve been here before, you know what I&apos;m talking about. 

Tip: download their app to order. It&apos;s easy and user friendly. Ordering will temporarily shut off when they&apos;re ultra busy at peak times (usually weekends), but just remember they&apos;re a small shop with a (very, very nice) small staff."
5,"Can&apos;t compliment this place enough. The sandwiches are always huge and delicious, stuffed full of your protein of choice. They also offer great vegan and vegetarian options. Both the interior and staff are ~fun and quirky~ as part of their brand, and they use their platform for activism (they have Black Lives Matter on their website and painted on their boarded-over windows). I absolutely love Middle Child and I go every time I find myself in Philly."
4,"I&apos;m by far disappointed today; i have had the court street rueben a few times; however today was different; did an online order, picked it up and the first bite you can taste nothing but burnt rye bread; after the first bite, i was done; came over from New Jersey because i had a taste for this and it was a waste of time and money; to top it off, i now have the burnt taste on my pallet; However, i did have the opportunity of speaking with Matthew the Owner and he was very nice and apologized for my experience and made it right. 

Sometimes what you may think is a bad experience, can end with a great experience. Thank you Matthew; they need more owners like you"
5,"The Shopsin might be the best sandwich I&apos;ve ever had....it is more than the sum of its parts witb perfectly toasted ciabatta and the cranberry-miso mayo honestly elevates that sandwich to new heights.

All their offerings are tasty - but I always end up thinking of the Shopsin."
5,"Veggie sandwiches are a special art that sits in a class of their own. Shouldn&apos;t even be thought of the same as meat based. It&apos;s different. 

Middle Child knows how to do a veggie sandwich better than the rest. I have tried all their veggie and vegan, they are Veryvery good."
5,"I&apos;ve always passed by this place but could never make it when it was open! It was a bit of a wait but sooo worth and obvious as to why there are lines outside. I got the shopsin club and I could not stop raving about it after every bite! The ciabatta bread is nicely toasted and crunchy. Idk what they put in those sweet pickles but it brought the whole sandwich together for me! Thick layer of turkey, lots of avocado and loved the cranberry miso mayo! My fiance got the So Long Sal and he also loooveed the bread and everything about it. They definitely don&apos;t play around with the serving size! I was full for the rest of the day!"
5,"Exceptional sandwiches. The bread is super crisp,
Tons of avocado, delicious turkey. Highly recommended! I suggest they add more sandwich options"
