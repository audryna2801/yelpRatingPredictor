5,"I am a DIE HARD omnivore! I see no reason to go out of my way to seek a spot that doesn&apos;t serve meat and if you are talking vegan I&apos;m a HARD NO!!  So for years I&apos;ve wondered why I couldn&apos;t get reservations to Vedge. I just couldn&apos;t imagine what the hype was about, but it became a personal quest to get reservations one day while visiting Philly. 

Then came COVID... I was with my Uber-picky, seven-year-old god-daughter and her vegetarian father and they had outdoor seating available for four. So we were finally gonna check out Vedge!

Y&apos;all I am reformed!!! This was the most amazing meal I&apos;ve had in a LONG time and that&apos;s saying a LOT!! They have an abbreviated menu with only 4 appetizers and 4 entrees available, so we ordered one of everything to share amongst the table. My God-daughter tried and loved almost everything!!

If I had to rank the courses it would go something like this:
#1. Rutabaga Fondue - I am a cheese lover and I didn&apos;t even miss the cheese! And that pretzel roll.... Good lawdy!!! 

#2 Chocolate cookie and key lime ice cream. Both were to die for!!! Still with no dairy!!!

#3 Dirt List Salad

#4 Avocado stuffed with deviled hearts of palm, heirloom tomatoes, green gazpacho vinaigrette and black salt - the stuffing was very dill forward but still yummy

#5 Smoked Portobello Carpaccio with caper vinaigrette and  nicoise potato salad -this was delish!!

#6 Charred Broccoli with spicy sesame noodles, smoky trumpet mushrooms and shaved cucumber salad. *contains gluten and sesame - loved this one too!! Perfect 

#7 Gochujang Glazed Tofu with edamame cream, nori and charred corn salad - tofu wasn&apos;t very firm but had a great char

#8 Bourbon Poached Peaches over decadent chocolate  was very rich and delicious!!

#9 Gold Bar Squash with chermoula, warm red lentils and a tomato olive salad - very Mediterranean

#10 Maitake Mushroom with smoked Chile glaze, black bean corn masa, whipped avocado and vegetable escabeche - my least favorite of the night

This place is DEFINITELY worth the visit!!"
5,"My husband and I were looking for a vegan restaurant in Philly yesterday and we were absolutely blown away by Vedge! I&apos;m still dreaming about last night&apos;s meal!!! The service was spectacular considering the outdoor seating and COVID precautions- but the weather was beautiful, the social distancing was appropriate and reassuring, and the servers were all so friendly.  We ordered the same dinner and both were so satisfied. I strongly recommend any vegan/vegetarian to check out Vedge AND even the non vegans can&apos;t afford to pass up a meal this high quality!! 10/10 will go again next time I&apos;m in Philly!!!"
5,Nice option to have for dinner in Philly for vegetarians in covid times. Service was good and outdoor dining experience was pleasant as well.
5,"So - if you are not a vegetarian, this is a great place to test a restaurant on quality and creativity of their food. I am not a vegetarian personally, and I would 100% go back. Their dishes not only tasted great, but they had sustenance. 

The entire vibe at the restaurant is fantastic. Great music, and the service is top notch. Really helpful with navigating the menu and providing drink pairings. Their drink menu is pretty expansive as well."
4,"I&apos;ve been to plenty of vegan/vegetarian restaurants in NYC and this place is up to par. 

The outdoor heating section was nice and cute. We got the potatoes, fondue, tacos, and noodles. 

All were really good and flavorful! 

The best was the crispy cauliflower taco. It is crispy, fresh, flavorful, spicy and just overall amazing. 

The best and highlight of my meal was the sticky toffee pudding. It was AMAZING. I&apos;ve gone to England multiple times and this was nostalgic and brought me back to a place I call second home. The cardamom icecream complemented it well and the cardamom wasn&apos;t overpowering like it can be. It was just overall the best dessert I&apos;ve had in a really long time and I LOVE dessert so that&apos;s saying a lot. 

The reason I&apos;m giving this 4 stars is because of covid times....I would have liked to see more hand sanitization stations. We saw one when we walked in the door but the outdoor seating area had none or wasn&apos;t visible. The staff would change our utensil and plates and although I&apos;m sure they take proper precautions....I would&apos;ve liked to be offered hand sanitizer before or after. We got our bill and paid for our bill and nobody gave us hand sanitizer after our meal. I think this is important during covid times. Otherwise pre-covid I would have given this 5 stars! Great service, great food and cute place."
5,"It is now my favorite Philadelphia Restaurant and what I could possibly say what other didn&apos;t. everything is perfect in here. there is some info and my experience.

We ordered some wine and I asked our waiter for his suggestion after describing what we like. He was able to make a great recommendation that we all enjoyed.

They specialize in smaller dishes, so expect to eat at least 2 dishes per person. You&apos;ll try to justify ordering more, though, because they are that tasty. 
Make sure you save room for dessert, too, because those are just as good as the savory items. It&apos;s easy to quickly spend a lot, but it is also worth it

The food and service was just as I imagined. Flavors were vast and extraordinary while the service was so prompt. 

Everyone should definitely visit this place as if they wanna enjoy a really good timing."
3,"I have been meaning to the Vedge since I was a huge fan of V street (now closed). Food was good but not spectacular. It is not easy to make vegan food rich but the restaurant succeeds in that. But, definitely not the best vegan food. For the price, I do not think the food is worth it.
On the other hand, highly impressed with their outdoor dining setup."
5,Food will delight vegetarians and carnivores. It will also make you aspire to cook
5,"I&apos;m not vegan, and this was one of the best meals I&apos;ve had recently. The radish crudite and charcuterie played with textures and flavors in really fun creative ways. The pho onion soup was one of the best sips of anything I&apos;ve had lately, especially knowing how hard it is to replicate pho flavor without beef broth. The forest mushroom side was bursting with incredible mushroom flavor, like grandmas mushroom soup x10. And the surprise of the night was the desserts. I&apos;m usually skittish of vegan cheesecake but this one actually made us ask our server James if the cake was really plant based. Overall, I&apos;m very excited to return and would recommend this to anyone for a delicious and well crafted upscale dinner, at a really sharp price point (we ate as much as we could, and with drinks and tip it was $75 per person... for this level of cuisine that felt extremely reasonable)"
4,"Was pleasantly surprised by how tasty everything was. The menu changes, but 5 of us we tried the carrots, the soft pretzel, tomato brioche, dan dan noodles, avocado dish, mushrooms, and a tofu dish for mains, and got the cheesecake for dessert. The tofu dish was a little bland, but everything else had a unique twist. The tomato brioche in particular was refreshing. Service was attentive as well.  Don&apos;t miss if you are vegetarian / vegan!"
5,"This spot is giving me all kinds of vegan feels....right there in my tummy. Got to my hometown of Philly and was in immediate need of body fuel. I researched vegan restaurants and this came up. The name was intriguing so I decided this is it...
So....wow! This spot is beautiful and the food was everything I needed and more. When I walked in the atmosphere was warm and cozy, and the staff was extremely welcoming and really pleasant. When I was seated the host made sure we were taken care of. He explained the unique menu and also gave me a little history on the restaurant and the owners. The menu had three segments for a The Vedge Bar (appetizers), The Grill (Main course), and The Dirt List (side dishes). Everything is vegan so I didn&apos;t have to get creative with my ordering which is usually the case for me when I go out to eat. I started with The Vedge Bar Rutabaga Fondue with a soft pretzel and pickles. This was such a comfort food and it was delicous. From The Grill I had  Grilled Avocado with trumpet mushrooms, salsa vercruz, poblano empanada, and jicama curtido. I also accompanied the dish with Jerk Glazed Romanesco which is a Trinidad Channa Stew. It was beautifully done and the flavors were intense, without overwhelming me. For Desert I had Sticky Toffee Pudding with Cardamom Ice cream and a Hazelnut Tuile. Once again....WOW! I will visit again, but until I do I have two vegan cookbooks that I was able to purchase.....smh....this was an awesome restaurant."
5,Yum and I love the atmosphere. Recommend for a date night. Not the most kid friendly. The menu is phenom
5,"Vedge was the perfect date night in Philly on a summer evening! Our server Harry was super accommodating and helpful, answering all our questions while maintaining a safe distance and decorum. 

I cannot recall the exact name of the dishes due to the rotating menu but it was alllll delicious! You cannot go wrong with anything you choose at Vedge. There is a lot of creativity and thought put into the combinations of flavors and ingredients. Not pictured but they had a blueberry cheesecake (vegan) for dessert and it was HEAVEN! I wish I knew how to make that at home!! 

We had a spritzer and tried a sour along with our meal which was very cooling. Thanks Vedge for such a great meal and great outdoor dining experience!"
5,"OBSESSED with this place. We had a reservation in for 7:30 PM on a Saturday and came in with my parents to celebrate my mom&apos;s birthday. My SO and I are vegetarian and my parents are vegan and oil-free. Not only where they able to accommodate the oil-free aspect, but they even had a prepared menu with all of the oil-free dishes. We have been to a LOT of restaurants around the world and I&apos;ve never seen anything like this before...my mom was shocked. ANDDD bonus points because they gave us the oil-free menus when we were seated at our table without us even asking. I LOVE attention to detail. So they were already off to a great start. 

We ordered some wine and I asked our waiter for his suggestion after describing what we like. He was able to make a great recommendation that we all enjoyed. Overall, I&apos;ll just say that service was on point the whole evening. The flow of our meal was never off despite being there at a very busy time. 

As for the food - I will say that I had read reviews before we came here and I was worried we would leave hungry... we ordered 2-3 dishes per person for our party of four and we were all stuffed by the end of our meal. So they&apos;ve either &quot;beefed&quot; up their menus since those reviews (pun intended!), or it&apos;s probably best to order a few dishes per person. 

We ordered the tofu, beech mushroom x 2, potato crepe, gold beet, rutabaga fondue x 2 (OMG I could literally eat this all day), broccolini, and stuffed avocado. Everything was amazing. I was super impressed with the presentation and flavors. Everything tasted very fresh and thoughtfully paired. 

We loved this place so much that I&apos;ve already made a reservation for when my parents and my SO&apos;s parents come visit us in May."
4,"A friend of mine &amp; I do a yearly  &quot;Vegan Week&quot;. This year looked a little different as we kept it very simple because of Covid. We knew we had to try out this raved about restaurant &amp; it did not disappoint. We order togo and waited at the restaurant while it was being prepared. The bartender offered us drinks while we waited but we decided to wait until we were home. Togo Margaritas are truly a thing of beauty! The bartender strained the ice so that it wouldn&apos;t be watered down by the time we got home. The mushroom carpaccio was definitely my favorite, entree &amp; the chocolate fudge bar was PHENOMENAL! By far one of the best restaurants throughout of 5 years of yearly vegan weeks!"
5,"Hands down the best meal I&apos;ve ever had in my life. I cried twice. I tasted god. 

First, a complimentary amuse-bouche: sunchoke bisque. This really set the tone for the meal. A perfectly warm little glass cup of bisque that tasted like a warm spring morning on a peaceful organic farm, like the light and love of the lord&apos;s fertile earth (I&apos;m not religious). I was brought to tears after the first sip. 

Next was the rutabaga fondue. This is a MUST ORDER. This is the tastiest thing I have ever had in my mouth. First bite, I cried again. Sobbed. The best flavor possible in the world. And that&apos;s just the dip itself. The fresh pretzel loaf and pickles accompanying it, my god, amazing. 

Everything else was absolutely incredible but those two dishes absolutely blew my mind. The chefs here are magicians from another realm. True artists. Wow."
5,"As a vegetarian, Vedge is definitely a treat. I thought everything was so unique and a completely different take from restaurants offering vegetarian food as an option instead of a focus. The restaurant is situated in a traditional looking building and dim lighting that sets the ambiance.

Although the waitress recommended ordering 3 items per person, we opted for 4 items total (2 each) which was more than enough. We ordered the Fancy Radishes, Rutabaga Fondue, Shaved Brussels Sprouts and Ssamjang Tofu. Of these, I loved the fondue and brussels sprouts. The pretzel bread that the fondue came with was amazing! We finished the meal with the caramel apple cheesecake which was also delicious. 

Would definitely recommend trying this restaurant out!"
5,"Best Vegan meal ever!

My wife is a vegan but I&apos;m an omnivore.  While visiting Philly we made an early dinner reservation for a long-awaited visit to this fabulous restaurant.  Neither of us were disappointed.

The atmosphere was great... a converted old brownstone with small rooms.  The service was impeccable with a knowledgeable wait staff and beautiful presentation of each dish by ingredient as shown in the pictures below.

I can&apos;t even remember what we ordered but everything was amazing.  best of all, each dish was unique... no faux &quot;burgers&quot; or &quot;mac and cheese&quot;, just super fresh, flavorful vegetables each prepared with a distinctive sauce. 

As a non-Vegan I left full and very happy.  I can highly recommend Vedge to anyone!"
5,"There are not many menus that tempt me to order one of everything, but the temptation is real when dining at Vedge, one of Philadelphia&apos;s best restaurants. You&apos;d never guess that the menu only offers vegan cuisine - the Rutabaga Fondue tastes like a delicious cheese dip, the Eggplant Bricole is as tender as any delicately prepared meat, and the desserts taste even more delicious than their traditionally prepared (with dairy) counterparts.

Vedge offers a relaxed and intimate ambiance for a comfortable night out with friends or a romantic meal with a significant other. Their excellent cocktail concoctions will make your night even grander. The Something Like Autumn cocktail is a stellar complement to most of the dishes with an Old Fashioned-like smoky taste, and the Carrie Appleseed cocktail (served in a tea cup) is a refreshing start to your meal.

A couple visits to Vedge, in addition to their DC restaurant Fancy Radish, make me a devoted follower of chefs Jacoby &amp; Landau, who have quickly established themselves as pioneers of the &quot;vegetable restaurant&quot; dining scene. Whether you&apos;re a vegan, vegetarian or carnivore, I guarantee you will leave any of their restaurants delightfully full &amp; satisfied."
5,"Pros:
