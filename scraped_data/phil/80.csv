5,"So. Funny how I haven&apos;t left a review for Vetri yet, even funnier that I waited for the End Times to do my review... But let&apos;s lean into it.

My wife and I have now been to many tasting menus. We make it a point to go to the best rated, fancy-pants-iest restaurants wherever we go. It&apos;s worth mentioning that whenever we go to one of these restaurants and they ask us where we are from and we answer that we are from Philly, the other restaurants always ask &quot;Oh, have you been to Vetri?&quot; We always answer (with pride) &quot;Yes. Twice!&quot;

Well, thrice now. 

The highlights, in no particular order, of this very special Covid-mas episode:

The pistachio cake was easily the best dessert I&apos;ve ever had, ever. Considering it didn&apos;t include chocolate, peanut butter, or bacon, that&apos;s pretty damn impressive.

The wine pairings varied from &quot;nicely complimentary&quot; to &quot;perfectly paired&quot; to &quot;my expectations were shattered.&quot; Every course we were pleasantly surprised as there was always a break out pairing.

For a very cold, very plague-ridden time of year, they had such an amazing setup that last year I would have chosen it for a lovely Christmas-themed experience even in non-Covid times.

The experience tonight made me realize just how, for lack of a better term, &quot;advanced&quot; the cuisine at Vetri is. My palate grows, is educated, is elevated, every time I come here. The fact that the entire experience is limited to Italian dishes and Italian wines, without being constrained by Italian tropes was nothing short of amazing to me. It makes me feel incredibly fortunate to be able to appreciate it.

TLDR: The question you should be asking yourself is not &quot;whether you should go to Vetri&quot;, but rather &quot;can you afford to miss it this season&quot;?"
5,"Vetri has been on the list for a while. I am glad that Philly opened up indoor dining when they did. I was able to make the trip to take my gf for her birthday dinner. This is definitely a special occasion kind of establishment. So save your pennies and go to Vetri when you want to splurge. I truly believe that if Michelin gave stars in Philadelphia, Vetri would be one of the frontrunners. For me the entire experience, start to finish, was 5 stars. We showed up about ten minutes early for our reservation and were given two aperol spritz to enjoy while we wait. We were called in shortly thereafter to be seated. 

As we walked up the stairs to our table in the upstairs dining room we were greeted by any staff we encountered on the way. While this is without a doubt fine dining, there is no pretentiousness lingering in the air. You feel as though you are being welcomed into someones home. Our waiter, Bobby, just made sure the entire experience was well rounded. He was very welcoming, extremely knowledgeable, and attentive. Everything from ambiance, staff, music, etc, set the tone for an incredible dining experience. 

Now on to the good stuff (the food). I won&apos;t cover every single dish specifically, but I will touch upon my personal standouts, as I couldn&apos;t pick a definitive #1 (that&apos;s a good problem). The prosciutto and the maple smoked duck breast were the perfect way to get the jowls salivating lol. The sweetbreads dish was bomb. They still managed to hold on to a little of the crispiness while covered in that delicious cream sauce.  The pappardelle with rabbit bolognese is an unassuming dish that packs a very well balanced flavor explosion. The stuffed guinea hen (prosciutto and foie gras) was another amazing dish. We also had tenderloin tartare, lobster tagliolini, and eggplant Milanese. We opted for the wine pairing and it was definitely worth it. Every wine was great and paired well with each dish. Even the dessert wines (which I am not normally a fan of) were great!  For desserts we had the molten peanut butter cake with Concorde grape gelato and the coconut semifreddo. The play on peanut butter and jelly was great. It&apos;s what you wish every peanut butter and jelly sandwich you ever ate tasted like. The sorbet that accompanies the semifreddo is the perfect refreshing palette cleanser to end the meal. Great meal (from the amuse bouche to the petit fours), great experience. I would highly recommend it. If you ain&apos;t treatin&apos; yourself, you&apos;re cheatin&apos; yourself! ENJOY!!!"
5,"tl;dr a Philly fine-dining veteran, Vetri serves up incredible Italian food with a generous side of nostalgia

Vetri is no stranger to conversations about the best restaurants in Philadelphia, promising an unparalleled take on Italian dining. I&apos;ve been meaning to give it a whirl for years, but life has blocked me out last-minute each time I&apos;ve scheduled a reservation. And, ironically enough, the wake of the pandemic was finally my time. Indoor dining mid-COVID is a new challenge for restaurants and restaurant-goers, alike. Fortunately, Vetri did a phenomenal job of ensuring social distancing throughout our visit -- most notably, were separated from other tables by both plenty of room and by physical dividers.

Walking up the stairs to Vetri&apos;s dining room felt like being welcomed into an old-school Italian home. A center island and espresso machine are on full display in the space, and the lime-green walls are highlighted by Victorian guardrails and wooden accents. The semblance of traditionality is sharply contrasted by a deep red blown-glass chandelier, while 50s music plays unobtrusively in the background.

We were welcomed with a complementary spritz, a summer crowd-pleaser with an orange liquor base and a slice of fresh fruit. As we browsed the menu, our server eagerly highlighted some of her favorites. We opted for the Beef Tenderloin Tartare, the Sweet Onion Crepe, the Swiss Chard Gnocchi, the Corn Anolini the Dry Aged Pork Loin, the Roasted Baby Goat (a $35 upcharge), the Chocolate Polenta Souffle, and the Panna Cotta with Poached Peaches and Raspberry Granita.

To kick off our meal, we were ushered a bowl of focaccia and whole-grain sourdough. The airy center of our bread was contrasted by a delicately charred crust, complemented by a salty butter. We then were offered an amouse-bouche: cucumber-zucchini gazpacho with a tempura squash blossom. Each bite tasted like summer, transporting me to childhood afternoons rolling down grassy hills.

On to our antipasti, the tartare sported a blast of acidity from the red onion and capers. Admittedly, I would have preferred the crisp of traditional toasts over the somewhat doughy gnocchi friti, but the dyanmic flavors were a strong win. Meanwhile, the crepe was magical--the condensed onions almost had a jam-like consistency and the smokiness of an open fire, bound by a rich pasty and truffle cream sauce. By transforming the essense of onion into something brand new, it&apos;s no wonder that this is one of the Vetri&apos;s classics after 2 decades.

To the pasta course, the gnocchi themselves were heavenly pillows, with a richness of butter and ricotta that gave way to the delicate flavor of the chard. Meanwhile, the anolini highlighted the sweetness of summer corn, echoing the sweetness and happiness of the best corncake of my childhood. This was doubled by the zing of salt from Osetra caviar. 

For the entrees, the goat was the fancy rendition of a holiday roast: the polenta itself could stand its own, and the meat. (especially the crispy skin) was loaded with flavor from spices and flame alike. This was arguably the best dish I&apos;ve had the pleasure to enjoy this year (and well worth the $35 supplement). On our other plate, the espresso reduction and the duo of honey nut squash were the standouts, adding a desserty dimension to an otherwise standard slice of meat.

Finally to dessert, the souffle was masterfully cooked, the dynamic dark chocolate finding the ideal balance between dense and gooey, and complemented by a vanilla gelato and cocoa nibs. In contrast, the zing of the summertime fruits brought the lightness of the last days of summer to the panna cotta. Lastly, we were offered 2 flavorful final bites: a fruit-creme truffle and an almond cookie.

At $110 for the COVID 4-course tasting menu (a relative steal compared to the $165pp just a few months ago), Vetri undoubtedly is a meal fit for a special occasion. But just the goat alone is reason enough to splurge on the experience. While I wondered if I would be missing out on the full Vetri experience, I nonetheless and left feeling contently full (rather than overwhelmingly so). Most importantly, Vetri left me with a memorable experience, both in exciting new memories and in ones I haven&apos;t recalled in years."
5,"It would be easier to list the things that were negative about this experience than those that were great. So here were the things that were wrong: the meal ended too soon. Here are the things that were right: everything else. 

From the hospitality to the efficiency to the quality of food, this experience was absolutely the best of the 4 times I&apos;ve been here. I really can&apos;t find much of a flaw with any dish we were served. The seasonal additions were incredible. The fish was perfectly cooked. The guinea hen was tender and the jus was out of this world. The smoked pickled mushrooms...tell me the last times anyone has ever had them. The duck breast was great. The wild boar ragu was awesome. The fluke was insane. 

Though the price is steep, it&apos;s absolutely worth it. Best food I&apos;ve ever eaten, and it&apos;s not even close. Great experience!"
5,"Thoroughly enjoyed my dinner here.  My highlights would be the steak tartare and the dry aged beef that I had as my main.  The wine pairing was also worth it as well.  

They gave us a nice pre dinner cocktail which was excellent along with an amuse bouche."
5,Always amazing!!! The wine pairings are perfect. Service is out of this world. One of the best!!!
5,"I can&apos;t say enough about how amazing our dining experience was at Vetri Cucina. We came here the night of our engagement for a very special celebration. When you first sit down, they offer you a complimentary glass of champagne (which they also refill if you don&apos;t order any wine) and present you with that evening&apos;s menu. You are encouraged to communicate the dishes that you would be most and least interested in, as they try to tailor the meal to each diner&apos;s preferences. Each dish is on the small side, but with so many courses we were definitely stuffed by the end of the night. I also loved that my fiancée and I were presented with something different at each course, so we could essentially try double the number of items. All the food was exceptional, but the pastas were OUT OF THIS WORLD! They were truly some of the most thoughtful and well-executed pasta dishes I&apos;ve ever eaten.

The service was first-class, as well. Always being sure to refill our waters (and champagne), answer any questions, and clearly explain each and every dish. They definitely do everything they can to elevate the experience and make you feel special. And this place is certainly reserved for very, very, very special occasions. For us, it was likely a once-in-a-lifetime meal, since it was certainly the most expensive meal either of us have ever had. Having said that, if you are a foodie like me and can splurge on a memorable night, I would say do it."
5,"Overall, my dinner at Vetri was one of the best meals I&apos;ve had in my life- maybe even top 5. However, this review is really 4.75 stars because one of our dishes was less than satisfactory which I will explain later.

It&apos;s a small spot with only 30 something seats. My husband and I were seated in one of the front windows which was a great table. Our service was excellent from start to finish- we were a little early to our reservation and the hostess gave us a complimentary aperol spritz to sip on while we waited. Eric was our server for the night and he was excellent- well versed on each dish and very attentive.

I love a good tasting menu and the best part about Vetri&apos;s is that they give you the option to &apos;yes&apos; or &apos;no&apos; certain items- they let you see the menu and if there is something you MUST have or, on the contrary, something you do NOT want, you can let them know ahead of time. The other huge plus about Vetri&apos;s tasting is that not everyone at your table gets the same set of courses! That means that I, since I dined with my husband, was able to taste even more courses than I would have if we had all the same dishes. Here is a quick rundown for anyone visiting Vetri in the near future:
1. starters included mozarella, the most delicious fennel crusted with parm, and an amazing pastrami foie gras. 
2. next up was the hamachi crudo and the bison tartare. Between the two, the bison was the outstanding dish and I could have kept eating it all night. The hamachi was great but the fish + citrus combo is not my favorite so I much preferred the tartare. 
3. the sweet onion crepe, diver scallops and prosciutto cotto were next, all of which were absolutely divine. However, the prosciutto was the clear winner to me and may have been my favorite dish of the entire night. 
4. next up was our first of two pasta courses. I loved that the first round was a small sampling of three of their dishes so as not to overwhelm or stuff you with pasta. We had two plump spinach gnocchis, two almond tortellinis with truffle sauce (this was one of my must-haves), and two ricotta raviolis. These three were equally stunning dishes.
5. the second round of pasta were slightly larger servings, enough for a few bites each. We had the tajarin with mushrooms and the busiate with pork shank ragu. Of these two, I preferred the tajarin (i love a pasta with mushrooms) over the busiate, which I found to be a little bland and lacking in the vibrant flavors all of the preceding dishes had. Overall, however, I definitely preferred the first round of pasta dishes over the second.
6. the next course was our &apos;secondi&apos; which I had not paid much mind to when looking over the menu at the start of the meal so I had not given a preference. My husband received the capretto with polenta which was lightyears ahead of my dish although not my favorite of the night. I received the bollito misto which is my reason for the 0.25 star deduction... this dish was so underwhelming and disappointing I was left a little shocked that the same kitchen could turn out all the dishes mentioned above and this one. To be fair, I do not care for stews or crockpot dishes because, to me, the flavors all blend together into one taste which I hate. This is what the bollito misto tasted like since it is literally just meat and vegetables boiled together. I understand that this is probably a very traditional italian dish but there was nothing about this dish I liked. Even the accompaniments did not seem to go with the rest of the dish (the salsa verde, although good on its own, seemed especially out of place). 
7. Thankfully, dessert picked right back up where we left off at the pasta and all three dishes were fabulous. The lime posset was definitely the underdog here but still good. The hazelnut praline semifreddo and the pistachio flan were BEYOND... and I don&apos;t even know how to describe them so just trust me when I say you need to try these.

Ok, so now we get to the price. Yes, it&apos;s a pricey tasting menu but for $330, the cost of two people, we got to try 15 dishes, not including the starters, the vast majority of which were what I call &apos;mind-blowing&apos; dishes (aka I cannot make this at home and I have NO idea how they made it taste so good). Vetri is a very high caliber restaurant and it is obvious why they have been around for over 20 years now. I like to think my very disappointing entree was a one-off since almost everything else was outstanding. I will definitely return."
5,"Vetri deserves consideration in the same category as 2 or 3 star Michelin Guide restaurants (there is no guide for Philadelphia).

Our party of three chose to forgo selecting our courses and instead allow the chef to provide us a full tasting menu experience.  We had myself (no restrictions), my wife (no veal and no octopus), and our friend (ovolacto-vegetarian).  The staff was graciously accommodating to our dietary restrictions.

We also chose the wine pairings.  What follows is my experience, but I tried several of the other dishes served to my companions and they were all amazing.  Photos to follow...

First course;  Crudités with balsamic olive oil Dijon reduction, Potatoes over garlic aioli, Buffalo mozzarella with EVOO, a Spinach/grain tort, and Foie gras on brioche toast with strawberry reduction. Flavorful and warm palate.

First bread offering;
House tomato focaccia with butter and finishing salt.  Delicious.

Second course;
House cured local beef bresaola over watermelon cantaloupe salad.  Light, sweet, and savory.

Third course;
Braised Octopus and pork belly.  Lipstick peppers.  Chicharron and lime salt.  Very well prepared.

Second bread offering;
Semolina focaccia.  Intriguing taste and texture.

Fourth course;
Trio of pasta.  Swiss chard gnocchi with brown butter, almond tortellini with truffle sauce, and corn agnolotti.  The three dishes complemented each other very well.

Fifth course;
A second pasta course.  Busiate pasta with pork shank and green peppers.  The hand rolled pasta was delightful and the sauce mild enough to allow the flavor of the fresh pasta to shine through.

Third bread offering;
House made Sourdough.  A nice palate cleanser at this point in the meal.

Sixth course;
Elysian Fields rack of lamb, with a lamb sausage wrapped in greens, and pickled/charred Swiss chard.  Perfectly cooked.

Palate cleanser;
Thomcord grape sorbet (made with olive oil).  Delightful.

Seventh course;
Sweet corn panna cotta with peach and polenta crumbs.  Simple and elegant.  Perfectly prepared.

Finishing;
Caramel bonbon, Plum macaroon, and Chocolate espresso almond opera cake.


Absolutely worth the price and time to visit."
5,"Vetri is hands down the best Italian restaurant in Philadelphia. I&apos;ve wanted to experience it for the longest time, but the timing never worked out in my favor. I was smart and made a reservation a few months ago when I knew that I would be in town. I was also lucky enough to get a reservation for lunch which Mr. Vetri only offers on Friday.

It was a little tricky for me to find as it is located in a town house. The signage is low key and unassuming. Once I entered, it felt like I was in a friend&apos;s home. I was greeted by the host immediately and seated quickly. The dining room is small and intimate with just 11 tables. 

The server came over quickly and went over the wine list making recommendations. I stuck to water as I did not want to dilute my taste buds. 

When the server returned with the water, he went over the days tasting menu in detail. He also pointed out their most famous dishes and made recommendations based on my personal preferences. 

The prosciutto cotto, truffle onion crepe, swiss chard gnocchi, almond tortellini, baby pork chop and fluke fish were ordered.

A basket was delivered with a variety of hot homemade breads. The breads were unreal. They were soft and flavorful. I was also given a plate of buffalo mozzarella, foie gras and something else that I can&apos;t remember. I love foie gras, so I was in heaven when it was placed down in front of me.

Each dish flowed perfectly. I&apos;d finish one and would receive the next one about 10 minutes later. The servers remained exceptionally attentive without being over bearing.

The almond tortellini was out of this world. It melted on the tongue. The flavors complimented one another. They are known for this dish, so make sure you get it!

The swiss chard gnocchi was fabulous. Just like the tortellini it melted in your mouth. I&apos;m not a fan of gnocchi in general, but I would definitely get it here without hesitation.

The baby pork chop was succulent. It was cooked perfectly and melted in the mouth. The broccolini was sautéed beautifully and it was flavorful.

I didn&apos;t enjoy the truffle onion crepe. It was too bold for my liking.

The polenta soufflé was awesome. It was sweet, but not too sweet. The home made gelato that accompanied it was outrageous. 

The server than brought out a surprise plate of various sweet treats. They were all incredible and the presentation was gorgeous. 

All in all the entire experience at Vetri was top notch. The service was perfect and the timing of each course being delivered was just right. The manager visited the table and while he was polite, he came off as stuffy. This was the best meal by far that I&apos;ve had in recent memory. Vetri will definitely be a place that &apos;ll eat at whenever I&apos;m in town."
5,"Came by again for an anniversary celebration. The place is wonderful see my previous review for details. This time we came in Summer last time it was Winter - the menu is always changing . 

Very enjoyable. Extremely solicitous and knowledgeable staff. Every server knows every ingredient and how each dish was prepared. The wine steward stopped by regularly to explain every wine. Outstanding menu offerings and preparation beyond compare. The wine pairing menu was perfect and an upgrade from our last visit. I think we will do this again when we return. Why pick a wine or drink a cocktail when they match everything with the food and courses for you? So nice to let them do the driving. We overdid it a bit with the dolce course. 

Highly recommend for a special, once in a while experience. Save up it ain&apos;t cheap but well worth it in our opinion. 

Mark &amp; Nancy."
5,"My husband and I dined at Vetri over the weekend, and it did not disappoint. The wait staff was superb, from the beginning to the end of the service, though I have to say service did start out slow - it took a while for us to get seated even though we had a reservation. And we didn&apos;t get menus for 15 minutes after we were seated. It definitely got better and picked up as the courses started flowing. Our server started us off with some predinner bites, which were pretty good. The standout was the foie gras on toast. As part of the predinner bites, we were also served local raw vegetables consisting of sliced carrots, radishes, etc, with a side of oddly looking balsamic jelly, which seemed inconsistent with the tasting menu and did not taste good. Other than that, everything was great. Our server was very friendly and went over the tasting menu with us. The tasting menu consists of 4 courses, with about 4-6 items under each course. Not all of the 21 food items would be served. Instead, our server explained that the menu should be treated as more of a guide, and the chefs would tailor the tasting experience to each table based on each guest&apos;s food preferences. The chefs sent out different dishes from each course for my husband and I so that we could taste as many different dishes on the menu. Of the 21 items, we had 14 of them, which was plenty. We shared and enjoyed everything, especially the pastas. They were definitely the BEST that I&apos;ve ever had. Some favorites of the night were:
- Bay scallops with caviar (Antipasti)
- Sweetbread saltimbocca (Antipasti)
- Prosciutto with brown butter, pepper and nuts (Antipasti ) 
- Cauliflower scapinocc (Pasta)
- Busiate with pork shank ragu (Pasta)
- Duck with chicories + &apos;nduja (Secondi)
- Chocolate polenta soufflé (Dolce)
Also, we probably got three different bread baskets throughout dinner. They were all very well made. The focaccia bread was the best though. It was super soft and spongey. After dessert, our server brought over post dinner treats including profiteroles, cake bites and chocolate! Yum! As we finished up and got ready to leave, our server gave us to take home our own Vetri menu and some chocolate caramel pretzel bark. A very nice touch. Vetri was a pretty cool experience and we will surely be back."
5,"Two things, if you read nothing else:

1. It IS worth it. 
2. This is a fine dining experience at its very best. 

Wow wow wow. How lucky were we to fly into Philly, randomly find Vetri on an Eater List, call and get in last minute on a Thursday evening, and then have one of the best meals of our life? So. Lucky. 

Having known about Vetri for only around an hour before our reservation, and doing no further research aside from its being recommended and knowing it was prix fixe, we were utterly impressed from start to finish. 

We waited for only a moment in the entrance before our table was prepared... &quot;snacks&quot; and spritzes arrived right after. Both perfection, with a balsamic crema and crudités and a brioche/foie Gras being our faves. 

The dining room is small, seating only 32 as we were told. We had a corner table and could see the room - it looks much larger thanks to carefully placed mirrors and gorgeous architecture. 

We were offered a menu to peruse and guide our server away from anything we don&apos;t love, but we eat everything and opted to be surprised. 

We also opted for the 6 wine pairings to accompany - that was a great idea. Super impressed with the pairings, and how each was well explained along with each dish, complete with interesting facts and tasting notes. 

I think we lost count of courses... and it felt like the chef and staff spoiled us with a few extra treats and bonus dishes... not sure if it was for any particular reason or if they were just having fun with us and enjoyed watching us totally swoon the whole time. 

In short, the service staff and the cuisine were just perfection. We can&apos;t wait to return and would fly back into Philly for a reservation here alone with no other plans... and we probably will. 

Now I&apos;m off to order all of the chef&apos;s books."
2,"The service and ambiance was wonderful,  complimentary aperitifs and petit fours were a nice touch too. But everything else left us wanting...even with a nearly $500 bill for (2) people.  We were so underwhelmed especially as this was our first visit to one of Marc Vetri&apos;s restaurants."
5,"This was utterly stunning!  Among the bestt dinners and service I&apos;ve ever had.  Its pricy but so many dishes on the tasting menu. My wife and I shared a completely different menu for each of us.  Wine pairings made it pricy.  Our wines were completely different as well.  It was a cornucopia of variety s d detailed &quot;chefery&quot;.  

In an old rowhouse the vibrant gayborhood.  Quiet street and lovely dining room with about 12 tables.  The service was personal and not obtrusive.  As the courses come ...they mount in size of dish to what was a terrific goat confit.  We must have had 16-20 different dishes with very different flavors.  Omg!!!!!

Finally, they packed up the menu, the wine list with wines we liked all marked...and a bag of granola!!!!!

Vetri will set you back  but WOW!!!!"
5,"Let me begin this review by saying that it has been a dream of mine to dine at Vetri. 

I work in Chicago as a restaurant manager/beverage director at a fine dining restaurant. Additionally I lived in Italy for 5 years. 

The result of the visit leads me to conclude that Vetri is among the finest Italian restaurants in America.

First and foremost, compliments to your FOH staff. I was so impressed by the staff&apos;s knowledge, disposition, and attentive service. 

The decor is simplistic yet thoughtfully connected to the Italian theme.

 As regards food and beverage, the food was as good as mainland Italy. Stand out dishes were the onion crepe, hamachi crudo, the spinach gnocchi, mushroom fettuccine, and duck confit. 

The wine selection is well thought out representing both classic producers as well as some more unique selections. 

The icing on the cake was that Chef Marc was in house and visited the table multiple times. 

Dining at Vetri was a dream come true and it did not disappoint. Complimenti!"
5,"There&apos;s a reason that Vetri has been The Godfather of Philadelphia for the last few decades.  This restaurant is everything you&apos;ve heard and better.  Even better, Chef is in the restaurant a lot and he&apos;s cooking...believe me that is rare for someone at his level.  

Whatever you need to do, save your money, sell your car or take out a loan.  Get the tasting menu, don&apos;t get picky when they ask (of course unless you have allergies) and enjoy one of the best meals in the Country."
5,"Wow. Just wow. The atmosphere is cozy, maybe not the most intimate and romantic but the building is gorgeous and all the architectural design details around the small room are beautiful. When you walk in the host will check your reservation (you have to have a reservation) and bring you to your table. They greeted me with a sparkling cocktail. I opted to avoid looking at the menu and allow the chef to surprise me. First they checked in with me to ensure that I did not have any allergies or foods that I disliked. I think that I had 13? ish courses. I opted for the half wine pairing with my meal. Overall the meal was artfully crafted and expertly designed. My favorite course was the add-on course of the white truffle pasta, it was absolutely decadent. Between several of the courses they brought out different bread offerings. I enjoyed each bread option, except the sour dough (it tasted overbaked ... Maybe even burnt and not in a good way, in my opinion). The baby goat was fall-off-the-bone delicious. Unfortunately, I was too full to finish my final course of chocolate offerings but they made a delicious breakfast! It is obvious why this place has won multiple James Beard awards. The staff were kind and very knowledgeable (although I will admit I found that I had no idea what they were talking to me about half the time). If you have several hundred dollars to spend per person, definitely check this place out. 

Side note: I came alone and while I had an amazing time, I would say that this meal is best shared with friends or loved ones."
5,"It is hard to say that a restaurant where the only choice is the 165 dollar tasting menu but Vetri Cucina is almost a steal for that price. I came here for an anniversary dinner and it was without a doubt one of the finest meals I have ever been a part of. 

The service here is absolutely phenomenal. The wait staff were attentive, knowledgeable and extremely pleasant. They were never overwhelming but also made sure your wine and water were always full. They took time to explain the ingredients of each dish and tell you a short story about the chefs creation of it. 

The meal began with a complimentary cocktail, a play on the Aperol Spritz which was refreshing and delicious. We continued onto 8 courses and probably 15 different dishes. We are given the option of choosing from the menu or letting the chef decide and we opted for a mix- requesting a few items other people had told us were must haves and letting them choose the rest. I think we would have been fine letting them choose the whole thing. The highlights:

The sweet onion crepe- it doesn&apos;t look like a crepe or taste like an onion but it was an absolute delight. One of those moments where you eat something and realize you are tasting flavors and textures you have never tasted before and you are loving it.

Spinach Gnocchi- the lightest , airiest and most delicious gnocchi I have ever eaten. 

The goat rib- I have never had goat outside of West Indian food and this was a treasure. Smokey, fall off the bone and entirely enjoyable.

Pistachio flan- an incredible desert with a perfectly baked thin flan exterior and hot pistachio that oozes out when you bite into it.

The wine program was exceptional as well. The somm made a lovely recommendation for a bottle based on our desires and the list is an absolute cracker. I can&apos;t wait to go again."
5,"Wow what an experience! Great service, drinks, and food. Our waiter was super attentive and had great recommendations. All staff were always available for questions or help. The food was so delicious. Pictures do not do the food justice! The pastas are some of the best we had ever had. Each dish was perfectly composed. We had the foie gras as an add on that had such a great flavor profile. I forgot to take pictures of dessert, (probably because they looked so good we ate them immediately) but they ended the meal on such a high note. Will definitely be coming back!"
