5,"This review is from a pre COVID visit.

Little Fish is truly a gem of a restaurant! There need to be more places like this in the city. It&apos;s pretty unassuming and tucked in a corner and upon walking in there&apos;s not much of a wow factor -- in a good sense! It&apos;s quaint and chic with only a few tables and almost full view of the kitchen. Depending on where you&apos;re seated you&apos;ll be able to see your food being prepared. This restaurant is BYOB which personally is always a plus. You can spend more on the food than you would on an overpriced small cocktail. 

They serve only seafood and the menu changes every so often. The menu by the way only has a few items. I love this concept as it ensures you&apos;re always getting superb quality. The dishes are light, delicate and intricate. My only complaint is that they&apos;re not larger so I can eat more of it! Overall I highly recommend this treasure of a restaurant."
5,"COVID food review - 5+stars!!

They started having a raw bar menu with high top tables outside. Payment is through Venmo. Saw this on insta and just had to come. 

The prices are definitely high, but the fish is beyond worth it. We got the red snapper ceviche, the scallop toast, and the lobster roll. All around dropped like $80 ish, so definitely bring that wine to fog that out. Place is still byob and they&apos;ll give you glasses. Otherwise water is also $2/bottle. 

Everything was super good but I&apos;m still thinking about the ceviche and the scallop toast mmmm. The combo of the red snapper, chili&apos;s, mango, and a lot of other things made it just so refreshing. The scallop toast was out of this world. The combo of the crisp toast and buttery scallops was just a match made in heaven. 

I&apos;ll be a repeat customer when I can afford it!"
5,"Disclaimer: this is a pre-covid review of this establishment just before I continue in case anyone was looking to go during these times, which based on other reviews seems to be still upholding. I want to start by saying this restaurant is absolutely a hidden gem. I stumbled upon it looking for my two favorite things: byob &amp; seafood. My first time at little fish was December 2017 and I have been in love ever since. The ambiance is very intimate; small tables maybe seating 24 guest in total, complete with an open kitchen. Dimly light yet still an elegant lighting to it. Service has been spot on every visit and i love the chalkboard menu on the wall (although they do have little handwritten menus as well). I have tried the oysters every visit and they are always fresh and even with the variety they offer, i enjoy them all despite my blatant preference for blue point. I visit every so often so a lot of my visits are blurred into one magical and delectable experience. I have tried every app from raw tuna, scallops, hamachi, octopus and a fluke in a lobster broth. I have absolutely no complaints. Yes it is a bit pricey, however you get what you pay for and the byob aspect balances out the cost. For entrees i have tried the halibut, bass, mahi mahi and even salmon. The sides are matched perfectly, the flavor is always spot on and the fish is cooked to absolute perfection. I am not a dessert person, but on my last visit i did get an apple dessert, not 100% sure what it was. It was tasty and a nice ending. My only hesitation in writing this review is that people will find out about this place and i will no longer be able to get a last minute reservation. An absolute must try!!!!"
4,"Cheers to Little Fish for offering a few unique options for take out that are vastly different from a lot of other restaurants. Obviously, we&apos;re a bit limited at the moment, so trying something new and exciting was a treat. My husband and I splurged and ordered two of the hamachi rice bowls -Â I managed to get the last two of the day! The guy who took my order over the phone was very nice. Once I arrived to the restaurant, I called and the bag was brought out right away. 

The bowls were put together nicely and everything was fresh. I think next time I might opt for one of the bento boxes for more variety. 

It had been ages since my last visit to Little Fish and I look forward to going back for a full meal when possible."
4,"If you&apos;re looking for a Little Fish in your diet during these quarantine times and, like me, don&apos;t trust yourself to procure sushi grade raw fish, don&apos;t love the sushi options still doing takeout, and are ofishally sick of your own cooking, give Little Fish a call and fish around your purse for your dusty credit card, check their Instagram for menu options, and order takeout from one of Philly&apos;s best restaurants to treat yourself for surviving this week/ day/ month! The hamachi bowl came with rice, cucumbers, and delicious marinated hamachi for $25 but they have other options like a Fluke Hoagie and a pork bento bowl. Don&apos;t forget to tip!

Years ago I got a gift certificate for my mom here for Christmas and we came and had a perfect Sunday night dinner- my mom loved the atmosphere, our food was delicious and the service was lovely. At the end, my mom tipsily confessed to me that it was the first time she&apos;d split a bottle of wine at dinner with just one other person (!!) Its a great memory and one that I cherish.

If you want to keep having places to make future memories like this, please go support local business during this though time.  A little support goes a long way during this time. They need you!"
5,"SO. GOOD. Everything was perfect.

Came on a Tuesday night around 6:30pm with two friends and a bottle of wine. Because we were all starving, we debated trying the tasting menu (3 from the firsts, 1 from the second, and 1 dessert), but because we wanted to try everything on that day&apos;s menu, we opted to share 3 firsts and 3 seconds. No regrets.

I honestly don&apos;t know what to write in this review other than that everything was cooked to perfection, and the presentation was beautiful. For example, the bass was accompanied by a miso broth, and although the broth by itself was a touch salty, it was perfection when eaten with the bass. I also loved the Asian-inspired flavors and ingredients. I&apos;ve never eaten lotus roots outside of China and my parents&apos; kitchen, but the pairing of the lotus root with the octopus was pure genius. 

Make the reservation weeks in advance. So worth the wait!!"
5,"This place feels like a turnt up version of home, serving some INCREDIBLE seafood at an incredible price. Came here on a Sunday night at 530pm with my parents to celebrate their 30th anniversary with a reservation for their five course seafood tasting ($48 pp without tax and tip). For the five courses we got starting from beginning to end: hamachi, scallops, tilefish, salmon, and a creamy dessert. 

AMBIANCE:
Little fish is in a incredibly cute neighborhood, and the restaurant is small with a few tables, but an incredibly warm, welcoming atmosphere and an open kitchen at the back. The open kitchen is great cause you get to see the chef prepare each course right from your table, and it adds more theatrics to the whole dining experience. Definitely a great place to celebrate an occasion, or for a not too fancy, yet elegant date night. 

PROS:
I love how Little Fish does this five course seafood tasting on Sunday nights, and they take two reservations at 530pm and 8pm only, as that is a rarity to find in Philly! Granted, we don&apos;t know what we will be served for each of the five courses that night until the moment you arrive there, so that was a pleasant surprise. Make sure you&apos;re a seafood lover before you come here because this place will not disappoint! 

Its BYOB, and the servers make sure that your drinks stay chilled for the entire night. Highly recommend pairing seafood with a nice sauvignon blanc or a good hearty white wine, and I brought a bottle of Kim Crawford&apos;s sauvignon blanc to pair with the seafood courses we got. It was fantastic. 

First course was the hamachi, which was served as a sashimi with a raspberry based sauce on top. Seafood was incredibly fresh, and they had bits of jalapeno to give it a kick. The red sauce was citrusy and acidic, and it definitely elevates the fish that we got.

Second course was seared sacllops on a bed of pea puree with a piece of toast. Honestly, those were some incredibly tasty scallops, and taking each bite with the pea puree with the toast was incredible! 

Third course we got was a tile fish that was served with some asian vegetables on a bed of butter squash puree. Fish was so delicious! The veggies and the puree were really creamy and paired well with the tile fish. 

Fourth course was a grilled salmon on a bed of roasted asparagus and potatoes. Salmon was seasoned well, grilled to a perfect medium rare, and the skin on top was really crispy like a potato chip. Asparagus and potatoes paired really well with the salmon. Probably some of the best seared salmon i&apos;ve got in awhile!

Final course was a dessert, and I wasn&apos;t too sure what it was. It tasted like part pudding but with a lot of mango zest to it. It was good, but nothing spectacular. 

Service was on point as the server explained to us each course - my bad for not remembering the specifics of each dish. She also came over and made sure our wine glasses were always full!

OVERALL:
I am impressed with my experience at Little Fish, and looking forward to bring more friends and family there next time I visit Philly!"
4,"Great seafood-centric restaurant that&apos;s BYOB! They have a small menu that&apos;s seasonal 

All of our dishes were very flavorful and the fish were cooked well! To be honest between the 4 of us we practically ordered the entire menu to share, so I can&apos;t remember all of the dishes, but GREAT FOR SHARING!

NOTE: its located in a cute neighborhood, so definitely a date spot!"
4,"My boyfriend and I came in for their Sunday night tasting menu. The restaurant is tiny and cozy. You get to watch the chefs prepare your meal which is a really cool feature. It makes it feel like you&apos;re in a home instead of a restaurant. The menu changes every Sunday and you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re going to get until it is in front of you. The five dishes were all incredibly well-seasoned and inventive uses of fish. We enjoyed every bite. 

The only complaints would be:

1. They didn&apos;t serve bread with the meal and consequently, there was little to no carb the entire time. This was problematic for two reasons. One, there wasn&apos;t anything to soak up the delicious sauces they made. Two, we left feeling a satisfied but like we could have eaten more. By providing some bread, we wouldn&apos;t have been left wanting. 

2. The portions were just a tad bit too small for the price point. We would have loved to see more sides which are inexpensive but make the meal feel fuller. The protien amount could have stayed the same, but perhaps with a little more food. 

Overall, it was a great experience. It&apos;s BYOB &amp; only $50 a person... what is there not to love?"
4,"I&apos;m a bit late but better now than never. My husband &amp; I wanted to experience a dinner tasting and this place had plenty of great reviews and it is BYOB! You definitely need to make reservations; we did ours on Open Table. It&apos;s a small little place on the corner and every seat was taken. 
We sat at a small table in front of the chef&apos;s area so we had a really good view of everything they were preparing. The service there was great, our server was pleasant friendly and our glasses never went more than half way empty.  Speaking of glass, I noticed something black in the pitcher they used and my husband said that the water tasted unlike regular city tap. I asked our server what it was and she said it&apos;s a Japanese charcoal that purifies the water, guess what we bought after dinner lol. Ok, back to the food, we did the tasting menu which was 6 dishes and I believe our tab at the end was ~$100 not including tax &amp; tip. 

On their website it does say their menu changes frequently and they get what&apos;s in season so I feel like our meal is a once in a life time experience. In order, this is what we were served: Pineapple shrimp ceviche, a seared scallop over a slice of heirloom tomato with nori sauce, baby clams with fried eggplant in miso broth, poached mahi-mahi in tom yum broth with a toasted sesame roll, wild flower honey yogurt with blue berries strawberries syrup. 

Each dish was so delicious and the flavors worked so well together I just wish I had more of it. I am not a chef, but I know how to eat and the combination of flavors and textures and just everything they put together was sooo good. If I could do dinner tasting every day of my life I would. For our 6 dishes it was about 20-30 min in between each one coming out so we still left a bit hungry but the quality was so good I will def return."
4,"I was so glad to discover this boutique restaurant and find out about their Sunday tasting menu. For just ~$50 per person, you get pre-fixe menu of five courses. Plus, it&apos;s a BYOB restaurant! There are only two time slots on Sunday (5:30pm and 8:00pm), and you&apos;re asked to arrive right on time so that every table can start the same dish at about the same time. 

The restaurant is tiny with just around 10 tables. If you&apos;re looking for a seat by the window, make sure to arrive earlier than your time slot. The server chilled our wines, and never left our glasses empty. They are very accommodating to any dietary restrictions you may have. 

The food is great, and one of the best seafoods for philly. Some dishes can be a little repetitive, and I was expecting at least one dish with bolder flavors. However, you really can&apos;t complain too much for such a steal.

We are slow eaters and usually take our time to drink the wine, so we ended up being the last table to leave the restaurant. I felt like the service can be a little rushed towards the last courses, and the next dish was immediately served after the plates are taken away. We felt a little pressured to eat faster, but when we left there was still almost an hour before the next reservations at 8pm."
5,"tl;dr a small, picturesque corner shop, offering a pescatarian-centric menu and one of the best-value tasting menus in the city

All too often, tasting menus feel pretentious and exorbitantly expensive. So I was more than a little surprised to find that Little Fish offers a five-course tasting for $48 -- almost half the price of a number of other Philly restaurants.

The space is minimalistic. White hexagonal tile lines the floors, while the walls and ceilings are painted black above whitewashed shiplap wainscotting. The wooden tables are set unpretentiously with a candle, and the room is abuzz with the chatter of guests as opposed to music. The small space has only a handful of tables, each with a comfortable distance. On the back wall lie tastefully framed portraits of select fish.

My partner and I visited Little Fish for their Sunday tasting menu last weekend. We arrived early enough to snag the table closest to the window, featuring a counter decorated with plants and cookbooks. Service was friendly, albeit bordering on quiet due to the echoes throughout the small space. The entire meal felt very personal, as all tables were served the same course at once. Each dish was a surprise, and one of the two servers would give us a rundown of our plate as it was served.

Our first course was hamachi sashimi, served atop a charred shishito pepper and a slaw of corn and green zebra tomatoes. Right off the bat, I was surprised by the subtly of flavors -- intentionally muted flavors of veggies were selected to accentuate the fish. Yet, the pepper still offered a hint of spice, the corn a pinch of sweet, and the tomato a drop of acidity. Our next course felt similar, a bluefin tuna tataki, plated with over roasted golden beets and blistered cherry tomatoes and topped with a garlic-mustard vinaigrette. This dish played more with temperatures and sauces to offer an assortment of flavor and texture combinations within the single plate. Up next was a Spanish mackerel confit, served alongside baba ganoush and sweet peppers, then sprinkled with furikake spice, Aleppo pepper, microgreens. In contrast to the former dishes, this course used the fish as a vessel to convey other stronger savory flavors. The baba ganoush was packed with Middle Eastern spices and the sweet peppers provided a crunchy zing. My only criticism is that the microgreens felt pretentiously superfluous on the plate. Our main course was a broiled Scottish salmon, plated atop a white bean sous vide and topped with tomatillos, crispy fried kale, and fresh sorrel. This dish masterfully channels seemingly mismatched ingredients into the comfort of a homemade meal. The sous vide achieved, the consistency and buttery richness of the best mashed potatoes, the salmon skin and kale offered a friendly crispy, and the tomatillo has a surprising tang. Our meal was rounded out by dessert: a Belgian waffles topped with maple-dark chocolate ice cream and crushed peanuts. Despite the simplicity, I thought the dish found a nice balance between rich and sweet. It&apos;s a shame the ice cream was already melty as my plate was served, but the warm waffle held up well.

After tax and tip, our meal worked out to $60 per person. On the surface, Little Fish incorporates a number of archetypal elements into its restaurant design. BYOB? Check. Open-kitchen concept? Check. Seasonal tasting menu? Check. But I believe that Little Fish excels in arguably the most important (and difficult) regard: the food was stellar. I am eager to give this place another go when the winter tasting menu is rolled out."
5,"So I ate here last week. We order the halibut, it was good but not worth ordering again. If we had just ordered that I wouldn&apos;t have even bothered to write a review. We did also get the ribeye and lobster. WOW everything was cooked perfectly, it&apos;s been my favorite meal of 2020. We literally ate everything on the plate. Our server was sweet and attentive. I will definitely be coming back"
4,"I recently went to Little Fish&apos;s prie fixe Sunday evening dinner and had a great time. The restaurant is intimate and you can see the food being made. It edged towards being too crowded noisy but never quite hit that mark which is good.

The service was excellent as was the food. I think the portion sizes are a hair small for what you are paying even though the quality is excellent but overall I very much enjoyed my dining experience and would go again!"
5,"A cozy BYOB with incredible fish! A bit on the pricier side, but definitely underrated for the quality of food you get. Honestly some of the best fish I&apos;ve had in the city 

Atmosphere: Quite small space; if you need parties greater than 4, definitely call in for reservations. Generally better for smaller groups (6 or less). You sit right by an open kitchen and can watch the chefs prepare the meals. Servers are friendly! 

Food: Oysters are very fresh, as are the fish entrees - they paired the halibut very well with the sauce. The menu is also seasonal, and handwritten for you (as well as the receipts). When we went, only one dessert was offered - olive oil cake with vanilla ice cream and pecans - their desserts will change, but don&apos;t expect too many options (like teas, coffees, other desserts etc.)

Recommended must-try: I loved their scallops, but keep in mind you only get 2, maybe 3, for ~$18-19. Also highly recommend the halibut - it just pairs so nicely with their sauce - quite creamy, but not heavy. 

Overall: 5/5 - I didn&apos;t think the portion sizes would be large enough at first, but you feel a right amount of full at the end! I just think their fish is incredible, and love the cozy atmosphere."
5,"I rarely give 5 star reviews but Little Fish is a rare gem in Philadelphia for seafood lovers.  During the current environment, they do have limited outside seating and limited hours (Friday and Saturday currently).  I opted for the take out option and we ordered the octopus and crab fried rice dishes.  I can honestly say I had the best octopus dish in my experience (albeit I have only had octopus in a non-sushi environment about 10 other times since it is rare to find at restaurants).  The octopus was mixed with kimchi but not too spicy.  The crab fried rice was also fantastic with lots of small bites of crab meat. The portions were significantly large and I actually found the prices to be reasonable ($41 for the 2 dishes).  

P.S.  Do not go by the menu you find on their website.  When I got to to the restaurant, about a third of the dishes were not on the menu but they had a larger selection on the paper copies."
5,"Little Fish is the perfect spot for a fancy dinner! The restaurant is very intimate and cozy. The menu is updated regularly. I really enjoyed all the dishes we ordered. The seafood was fresh and seasoned very nicely, complemented well by the sides. Service was very good as well. Definitely a great place for a special dinner and worth checking out for some delicious seafood!"
5,Reserved a table for the Sunday prix fixe at 5:30pm. Food was fantastic top to bottom. Accommodated my partner who can&apos;t eat raw fish. Service was attentive and pleasant. The price was extremely reasonable for the quality of the food and the portions across five courses. I would strongly recommend this place to anyone visiting Philly or who lives here locally and wants to treat themselves.
4,"Little fish is your corner neighborhood restaurant that is typically Philadelphia. It is literally in the middle of a neighborhood. How can that be? but that is just Philly- excellent food in every corner. 

The menu is small and ever changing which is wonderful but you can&apos;t count that it will be there the next time. The plates are small and a little on the pricey side, but the food is good. Really, really good. It is a byo so don&apos;t forget to bring your favorite adult beverage. 

Reservations are required because seating is limited. Tables are very close-and unfortunately, sometimes people have no sense of how close you are to each other.  I heard an entire (loud) conversation the last time we were there which sort of ruined an intimate dinner. 

All this to say, if you haven&apos;t been, it is one of those places that you need to add to your list. If you have been, time to go again."
2,"Portions are small and overpriced ( yes I understand most good restaurants are small overpriced portions). The menu is quite small and even if you love seafood (my wife and I both do) there&apos;s not many options.  Our dishes were unique and flavorful, if I was judging strictly on quality of food I would have given them 5stars. However when I weighed in the cost/portion/and menu options I came up with a 2. Also because of Covid we had to sit outside, they advertised on their website that there was space heaters next to tables, there were no space heaters."
