5,"During the COVID-19 crisis, the Mutter Museum is offering virtual events on Microsoft Teams. I attended their webcast titled &quot;Cabinet of Death: Care of the Collection.&quot;  This presentation was chock-full of interesting info, and the presenters were wonderfully enthusiastic about the museum and the subject matter.  I sincerely hope they will host more virtual events, and I hope to visit the museum in-person one day if I&apos;m in Philly. I&apos;m really glad I found the Mutter Museum&apos;s listing on Eventbrite."
5,"Philadelphians are so lucky to have a museum like the Mutter.

Someone was interested in physiology and anatomy, we spent solid 3 hours here looking and reading at every displays here.

Collection is extensive (from my non technical point of view), and it was very interesting....,

Okay not to me as I wasn&apos;t that into seeing brains and skull or any parts of the human body.

I however did enjoy their garden. Each plants has explanation on how they could be used as medicines. It reminded me of Maasai people in East Africa.  They have benches and I just sat there and waited most of the time while others enjoyed inside.

If you are into such things, come alone and take your time to enjoy their collections here."
4,"This place is cool and unique but not for the squeamish! 

However, and this was pre-covid, it was just jam packed with people with no real traffic flow like other people said. Doesn&apos;t help when some of the customers are loud and immature!"
3,"(This visit was made the week before the initial Covidious lockdowns began in mid-March.  When things return to a look of normality - your experience likely will vary.)

When I look back, it amazes me the difference a few days can make.  Like a lot of people back in March we knew that some kind of lockdown for Covid was coming and that&apos;s what pushed us to make a visit here the weekend before Wolfy closed everything up.  We figured it would be awhile until the opportunity presented itself again and who knew what a long strange trip it would be just to get to September, let alone what the next six months might hold?

Let me start by saying that Joe S.&apos;s review from 3/16/20 is more or less what I&apos;m going to be preaching although he is wrong about why the no picture policy is in place.  It&apos;s not that the place is a let down in so much as it&apos;s a one trick pony.  I don&apos;t think the main display galleries ever really change so if you see some of the things they have online do you really need to go in person?  In today&apos;s day and age where a lot of people are content to look at pictures or video in leiu of in person, why encourage people to stay at home and get the experience for free.  No money in that.

A few points:

- As mentioned the biggie here is no pictures.  There are signs everywhere and the security guards will forcefully &quot;remind&quot; you if they see a camera or your phone.  I get it.  People don&apos;t like that rule, but it&apos;s their rule, not yours so don&apos;t be an asshat and take pictures in the galleries then post them online.

- Parking can be challenging as the local area has a fair amount of residential on street parking along with some commerical mixed in.  While there are pay lots available I cheaped out and parked for free two blocks away on 21st.  It was early on Sunday morning and I would imagine that during the week it would be much harder to do what I did.

- Like Joe said the place is fairly disorganzied and pre-Covid damn, did they pack people in here.  We got to the museum about 30 minutes after they opened and already there was a good crowd but by the time we left two hours and change later, the upper balcony where the skulls are was immobilized with people all up each others asses and not eveyone was trying to go the same direction.  Total mess.

The skulls, the specimens, the instruments - some real, some not while some things are just down right disgusting and macabre.  Also keep in mind that nothing here is in any sense modern.  You&apos;re talking 20th and 19th century specimins, tools, displays and thinking.

While a visit was for a long time on my list of places to see in Philly the itch has been scratched.  Maybe if I were a medical professional or someone with a curiosity for things in this field I would be more inclined to make a return trip or to give our visit a higher rating but all things considered three stars is more than fair."
1,"We went today at 11:00 and were shocked by how CROWDED it was. Not only filled with people but no guidelines were given on how to tour the rooms to respect distancing. No paper towels in the bathroom and, as we&apos;re leaving, a guy in the middle of the lobby blowing his nose and then walking with a mask around one ear. The exhibits may have been interesting but we ran through to avoid the appalling number of visitors."
2,"We were so excited to visit this place, and it was a huge let down.  I&apos;m guessing the reason they don&apos;t allow pictures inside the museum because they don&apos;t want to let the cat out of the bag that it&apos;s not that great.  

This place need organized and overhauled.  Picture a few rooms with display cases throughout with absolutely no way to direct the flow of people.  Even IKEA steers you through their store.  It&apos;s a free-for-all of people squeezing in and looking at different medical condition specimens.  Depending on which way you go, you may miss something or not know what you&apos;re looking at.

On the top floor, the balcony has displays on two sides, so you basically have people going to the left and right, and looking at the left and right sides, so there&apos;s 4 potential directions people are going.  Downstairs, it&apos;s two rooms of displays, and they actually have drawers to look at things people swallowed.  The problem is, the drawers block other people from walking around and looking.

It&apos;s probably great for a doctor or medical student who knows what a lot of the terms mean already.  They could definitely improve the information they provide on each of the specimens.  (An audio tour similar to Eastern State Penitentiary would work great here).  Better descriptions would definitely help.  Who the heck knows what &quot;hydramnios&quot; is or what a &quot;fetus&quot; is?  C&apos;mon.  Explain better!

There&apos;s very little organization.  Sure, there&apos;s a skull area and a conjoined twin area, but it seems they organized it at first, and as they acquired new specimens, they put them in where they fit.  The was a jar of dried human skin, then somewhere else, another jar of dried human skin.  Why two in totally different places?  Same with other stuff.  Just random.

The Spit Spreads Death area was very timely due to the Coronavirus pandemic of 2020.  It&apos;s interesting what they did back then in 1918 with the many deaths from the Flu.

The staff was wonderful and they had a coat check and lockers so you could leave things behind.  If everyone had their coats, it would be even harder to squeeze in and see something.

Do they have cool stuff?  Yes, for sure!  But so much room for improvement on getting people through it in an organized way and explaining some of the specimens.  Total fail on the experience for us."
3,"Ive been here years ago for a school assignment when I was in medical assistant training to learn about the human body. After seeing jars of fetuses and other human remains in jars.... it made me rethink what field I was going into, I literally got sick in the stomach by many of the things I have seen in the museum. 

There was one display that had conjoined twins (babies) in a jar of embalming fluid. This museum isn&apos;t for the faint of heart. You can learn about medical history and the human body which was really cool."
5,"Had such a nice time exploring this funky museum a couple weeks ago. It was clean, spaced out, and, from what I hear, probably the best view of all of the exhibits since there werent crowds of people around. There were really interesting things there and it was a really great to have a place to walk around- and feel that I am doing it safely- in the city."
3,"Severely overrated. Extremely actually. Hence no pictures. 

There are somewhat cool things, yet gross, yeah, it&apos;s medicine for the morbid, whatever. I got to see a penis and a vagina. Don&apos;t bring your kids. Some of the people are very shallow also, man, this place is a letdown. 

However! If I was able to rate the cashiers at the gift shop, I would do 5 stars. Yeah, I can be shallow too, and the reason for the 3 stars and not just 1 (Thank you girls!).

Outside, to the right, there is a small garden that is very quiet and pleasant."
4,"The Mütter Museum is a fantastic place to learn about medical history and the human body that dates back to late 1800s.  The museum itself is not terribly large, but the displays were fantastic including different body parts and various diseases.  Just a tip, they do not allow any form of photography!"
5,"WOW WOW WOW! 

The Mütter Museum has been on my list of museums to visits for YEARS! I&apos;m sooo glad I was finally able to visit. It really was everything I thought it would be. 

A nice coat check room, people at the ticket area were kind and informative. They also have a nice gift shop with books, scarves, pins and some toys for young ones. Great book selection with the new Exhibit on the Influenza epidemic of Philadelphia. 

There is a lot of reading so be prepared if you have little ones with you. 

Although I understand no photographies I wish I could have. The NO photography is strictly enforced. Someone while I was there tried taking a photo and they were told to delete. I have a few pictures of the entrance to buy tickets that you could snap the camera. 

Highly recommend. We took an über just not wanting to deal with downtown traffic or parking and I&apos;m glad of the door to door service"
4,"Highly specialized
Hauntingly graphic
A great perspective reset

The Mütter could easily be taken for a morbid curiosity stop, but instead takes seriously its mission to &quot;disturbingly inform&quot; the public.  And it delivers. 

The vantage point matters here - much of the media is from a specific point in time; medical without the filter of today&apos;s norms or knowledge - and that helps to make the exhibits even more real.  Instead of distancing from the artifacts by explaining them away with how many of the maladies have become things of the past through modern treatment, there&apos;s a vitality to how scary, painful, and hopeless some of the afflictions would have been. It lends a sympathetic lens, and not a Ripley&apos;s Believe It Or Not tokenism. 

Time doesn&apos;t seem to pass linearly here - plan accordingly for the level of scrutiny you&apos;ll give the collection.  While you may find yourself deeply engrossed with numerous specific exhibits, the museum is really only a few rooms. Some may finish in 45 minutes and leave with a serious case of the willies, while others may linger over all the paraphernalia and step outside again after three hours (speaking of, bookmark a few minutes out in the garden, which is a nice palate cleanser of a stop). Recommended."
4,"Customer service: 4 stars: overall they were kind but security did badger me and my autistic son about his small backpack that holds his stimming items and personal care items. It was annoying to have to get a medical sticker for his backpack at the front desk. The museum should realize by now people are traveling from other states to attend and are out sight seeing and cant carry everything in their damn pockets. Whats the difference in a woman carrying her purse or if i was wearing a backpack style purse? At any rate its a stupid rule. They only allow back packs if you have a medical condition and can prove it. 

The museum: 5 stars: this place has been on my bucket list since i saw it on strange travels. Wonderful museum with lots of oddities. Im appreciative of all those who donated their bodies/body parts and babies to science/this museum. There is an upstairs and downstairs, there is an elevator for the handicapped. You can easily spend 2-3 hours here looking at everything.
Make sure you check out Albert Einstein&apos;s brain :-) 

Price point: 4 stars: children 5 and under are free and adults are $18 i think. Double check that in the event i cant find the picture i took of the price menu. 

Miscellaneous: if they catch you taking pictures they throw you out, no refunds, and will make you delete the pictures taken. I took pictures mission impossible style but out of respect for the families i wont/havent posted them but it will be momentos apart of fulfilling my bucklist item and for my children to look back on that they attended such a unique and marvelous museum. 

Gift shop: 4 stars: the gift shop has quirky and afforable souvenirs. My only gripe is i wanted to buy print art and they dont offer anything for travelers to carry it in. 

Overall: wonderful museum, im happy my ol man could give me this gift that i can scratch off of my bucket list. I would diffinitely come back if i was in town.."
1,"If you&apos;re in the medical field, research or interested in the human body this might be your gig. I really was into going because I thought it&apos;d be oddities of all kinds but instead it was filled with medical research oddities. There are  plenty of baby fetuses, diseases, screwed up looking bones, skulls and things under that umbrella. I left feeling sad and $18 (x2 since it was a date) poorer. Don&apos;t even get me started on this was supposed to be for a &quot;fun&quot; date. No, no and no. I&apos;ll stick the museums of Science, Art, Space, History and all the more enjoyment side. 

No cameras or backpacks allowed
Takes about 1 1/2 hour to finish
No food available but a few restaurants are nearby
Small shop is after for souvenirs 
Cute little garden is outside
Special exhibits are listed online but are not available everyday."
3,"I really did want to be blown away by the Mutter Museum.  We came here on a cold wet and snowy Saturday afternoon, looking for a nice experience and maybe a bit of having my brain expanded and mind blown.  Sadly I was a bit underwhelmed.

Not the fault of The Mutter Museum, but the crowds were problematic.  The far wall which included the glass case of skulls, how they all likely died (and lived) were cool, but the displays were all choked with people standing and reading.  Because there were displays on both sides of this narrow walkway, it was hard to skip ahead and you either had to wait for long periods of time, or skip this center piece.  

To be fair, all of the displays were put together very well, and some of the displays were excellent.  The young man who had a second skeleton was  well done and touching.  The woman with a true horn growing from her forehead was wild, While the downstairs area was less congested, outside of multiple deformities and oddities, things started to look the same.

There were civil war soldier displays that showed limbs that were shot with guns or maimed in other ways.  Gruesome?  I didn&apos;t think so, but I also wasn&apos;t very interested.  These, like many of the displays were more of a see it, saw it, move on so we can go.  Likely my own personal tastes, but as some have said, either you like the Mutter Museum or you don&apos;t.  I was more luke warm than anything.

No photos of any of the displays accompany this review, because no photos are allowed in the exhibits area.  You can capture photos in the main lobby however, as well as the garden.  Sadly during my visit, the garden was closed, which is a shame because I was curious about it from all the comments.  

We found parking across the street  right in front of the Museum, which, admittedly was lucky for us, but we were lucky!

Long story long, the Mutter Museum is a wealth of medical information, medical anomalies and if this type of material is your thing, you&apos;re going to eat this up and give it 5 stars.  If you&apos;re looking for a bit more, or aren&apos;t really into deformities, well, you may want to skip this visit. 

I was squarely in the middle, and while I did enjoy parts of the museum, I left a bit underwhelmed.  But that&apos;s my experience.  Hope you have a blast if you go!"
2,"I hate giving places two star reviews. Especially when they have been on my list of places to visit for such a long time. I was obtusely underwhelmed. Twenty bucks for this small, cramped, hot, and crowded museum. The exhibits were hard to see because they allowed way too many people in all at once, and it was suffocatingly warm inside. I wouldn&apos;t mind it being small, but when you allow this many people in and charge them twenty bucks, one just expects a little bit more. I found some of the displays to be redundant, and I was just wanting to get out of the stuffy and crowded space. I wish I had better things to say, but unfortunately I just can&apos;t give this museum any props nor praise. They sold &quot;snake oil&quot; in the gift shop, which is not dissimilar from what I felt like I had been sold with the price of admission."
2,"TOO CROWDED! which in some ways is not their fault, but they should sell timed tickets when it&apos;s this full. Lines to walk down the stairs. 
And it&apos;s small. Same size as ever, same exhibits as ever. Tho last time I came 15 years ago it was still free but the same exhibits mostly. So packed and everything is in glass cabinets so you can&apos;t see from any other angle. And this is a Monday. 

The current exhibit about the great flu of Philly is boring, imo. And there is a movie with no when you enter this exhibit but no explanation of what it is. Someone that works there heard us being confused and said it was a parade with people holding signs with the names of each person who died  from the flu back then. 
And the rest Is all reading, which I get- what is there to show? I sound like a kid- but maybe a movie /doc to jazz it up. 
If you&apos;re a scientist or doctor maybe it&apos;s interesting. 
I used to like to see the eyeballs in jars and skeletons - but not with so many people !"
4,So awesome! Worth dealing with Philly traffic and being in Philly haha. Parking is ridiculous though. The exhibits and gift shop were great. A lot of reading and very crowded. Give yourself time to wait your turn and read a lot of the exhibits. Very informative and fun.
3,"If you&apos;re interested in medical anomalies and bodily phenomena -- a replica of a horn growing out of a man&apos;s head! -- this is your kind of place.

The museum is relatively small, and while crowded, you&apos;re able to take your time and see everything.  The most popular exhibits are probably:
-- a colon with forty pounds of fecal matter.  (As photos are prohibited, one can buy a delightful postcard of this in the gift shop.  Ok, ok -- guilty as charged!  We wanted to shock our friends.)
-- a collection of skulls, captioned with cause of death, sometimes horrifying.

We overhead a docent say that they have many more artifacts not on display. I don&apos;t know if exhibits change. (The aforementioned crowd pleasers are part of the -- ahem -- &quot;permanent collection.&quot;)  But nonetheless, this is a one-time visit for me.  Med students take note:  check Mutter out.  You&apos;ll learn how NOT to amputate a leg."
3,"An interesting stop and worth a look.

I have been here in the past and it is good to see that they are keeping the exhibits and presentations up to date reflecting changing social customs and mores.

It is always educational and eye opening to peruse the exhibits and spend time reading the explanations of what you are looking at and the  how and why certain exhibits came to be.

$20. For an unescorted walk through the museum. There are docents around if you want more in depth detail on specific items.

Mark."
