5,"I can&apos;t believe I never left a 5-spot for Good Dog! 

I had my first date with my (now) husband here back in April 2015 and he introduced me to it. I loved the doggo photos everywhere! 

We would come back approximately on our anniversary every year for drinks and occasionally brought some trusted friends in for a burger. Love the wide beer selection.

He held my surprise birthday/engagement party here in January 2020. (Yes he made me wait five years.)  We had drinks and they held a cake for us in the fridge and sliced it up when we were ready. I love that the third floor is just open space to hang out for that.

We came to Good Dog for lunch after getting mani/pedis on our elopement day in July 2020 as they had just reopened outdoor dining. I had a lovely beet salad and some kind of lemonade cocktail. It was hot that day, but we had to make sure Good Dog was a part of it!

Now, on the one year anniversary of our engagement, we did takeout from Good Dog because I received a birthday treat reward from their rewards program - $20 off?! Woah. Best deal ever.

I ordered the brisket grilled cheese and hubby (I can say that now, aww) ordered the fried grouper po&apos; boy. We also got 2 Something Hot cocktails to-go.

Those cocktails will warm you upppp. If it snows again, I plan to get another round and walk in the snow with it. Vibe.

The brisket grilled cheese was also quite comforting after a ridiculously long unnecessary Friday of remote working. I would say the brisket to cheese ratio was probably 3:1 so in my book I don&apos;t think it qualified as a grilled cheese but NO MATTER. It was perfect, whatever it was. That aioli (I think) that came with it was also divine. I would like a whole bottle please.

Bae loved his po&apos; boy so much he finished it before I could take a picture. That sandwich was as big as my arm. It looked good from the few glimpses I caught of it before it was gone.

And shoe string type fries are always my fave. Nice touch.

Overall, always 5 stars and thanks for being part of literally every big moment in our relationship! 

I wish I had a dog to submit for the next photo contest, but alas - I am a cat lady. Maybe I&apos;ll get a picture of my brudder Champ in there some day.

ALSO: We aren&apos;t the type to do indoor or outdoor dining right now, but I did appreciate that Good Dog didn&apos;t create an &quot;indoor&quot; 3-sided structure outdoors. Their outdoor dining has plenty of airflow and is an open space with a roof to protect you from the elements. So if you&apos;re up for it, it seemed as safe as outdoor dining can get right now! They also have some 2-tops along side the building outside the structure."
5,"Friendly place for reasonably priced drinks and good food; great service provided outside adhering to covid restrictions. 
The drinks are made well - not watered down but also not over poured to the point where all you taste is alcohol. The only downside was the mixers. They do not have Red Bull. So, if vodka with Red Bull is your drink of choice you&apos;ll have to choose another. Also, 7up instead of sprite and the &apos;Coca-Cola&apos; was not Coke. Not a dealbreaker for me, just a note for anyone who&apos;s very particular about their mixers.
The food was very good. The deviled eggs had a super creamy filling, but we did ask for sriracha to add to them because we prefer our deviled eggs with a little more acid/kick. The burger was great. We added bacon (thick sliced and cooked crispy) and caramelized onions. The BLT with avocado was also very good. Both came with fries (10/10 for the fries), ketchup, and aioli. 
I can tell that this place is probably super hospitable and fun during non-covid times since we were able to have such a good time even with all of the restrictions."
3,"I&apos;ve been looking for the best burger in center city and I think the Good Dog Burger (Stuffed with Roquefort cheese, topped with caramelized onion, on a challah bun) is definitely a top contender! 
Not sure what you were craving, but get the damn burger.
Thing was just delightful. Flavorful. Juicy. Onions cooked perfectly. Bun had integrity and really held it all nicely together.

Here&apos;s the only downside. The fries were whatever. Forgettable. Very small crunchy things that I could only pick up with three fingers like a claw machine. 
They put some big ones on the top. But below that top surface area were these very sad potato things. Wish they complimented the burger more.

Service was friendly. However, and there&apos;s really no issue, but even if you&apos;re coming in to grab lunch they take a card from you, temporarily charge a $10 hold and then let you continue your day. I mean, I&apos;m not really &quot;opening a tab&quot;, I&apos;m kind of just ordering food. There&apos;s a time and place to begin tabs. Usually it&apos;s at crowded bars where the patron is moving around a lot. But a single guy sitting at a table for a burger at lunch isn&apos;t really that time. I get the establishment used to be a place for darts and pool and &quot;open tabs&quot;. But the only other people inside were old white folks enjoying their soup when I was there. So it&apos;s odd."
4,"My husband and I have walked past Good Dog Bar 100 times. So we finally decided to try it! We went on Halloween night, and it wasn&apos;t very busy at all so we were seated inside right away.  We loved the interior! They have adorable pictures of dogs all over the walls! 

Our waitress was great! She brought us water right away and got us beers. We ordered PBRs and they were brought out quickly! I decided to order the Good Dog burger and my husband got the wings. Our food was also out quickly!

My burger was really juicy! It was also really thick - close to 1.5 inches, which I&apos;m not a fan of because it doesn&apos;t fit to the edges of the bun and it&apos;s hard to take a bite since it&apos;s so tall. Anyway, it was still really tasty! It needed some salt though. My husband said his wings were good, not great but definitely a solid choice. But the best thing we&apos;re the fries! They were like shoe string fries! They were crispy and so so delicious! 

Overall, we had great service and good food! We are glad we tried it out! I don&apos;t know if we would seek this place out again for food, but the vibe is really cool, especially if you are a dog lover! But we would go back for a beer at the bar!"
5,"Love this place. The mojito here is really good. I had corndog, fries, and nachos, and all of the dishes are decent. It has a cozy and cool atmosphere. Can&apos;t wait to come back soon!"
3,"The place has a nice aesthetic to it. I liked the wall inside decorated with different dog pictures. I&apos;m not going to lie, the menu weirded me out a bit, nothing (other than the wings) sounded like something you&apos;d want to munch at a bar. But my bf and I went because it was behind our hotel and we didn&apos;t want to walk far.

My boyfriend got a cute drink with dog paws on the white foam. It tasted okay, I&apos;m not big on drinking. My ginger ale was flat, but my white claw mango was good. My boyfriend also ordered a sprite that was also flat.

The wings were amazing, spicy, and cooked to perfection. I hate slimy wings and these were FAR from it. Best thing about this place. I saw an image of their deviled eggs and it looked so appetizing, I had to get them. I literally bit into them with a smile on my face, but that quickly turned into a frown. Those devil eggs tasted very odd. I don&apos;t know what they put in them but it tasted like old Mayo. I was so disappointed because they looked like they tasted amazing.

Dessert was a creme brûlée which was okay. Very simple and sweet. Perfect size for 2. 

We had 2 waitresses both were very nice. I also liked that they gave us water to go! Very much appreciated!

Maybe the main dishes are better? I say go for wings and drinks but I&apos;m sure you can find them cheaper somewhere else. I probably won&apos;t be back if I&apos;m in the area."
5,"Went back to good dog this past weekend and they never disappoint! I love everything about this bar! The food is delicious, amazing drinks, and the decor inside is just adorable. This time we ordered the flatbread pizza, which was very tasty! Can&apos;t wait to come back and try more"
5,"Haven&apos;t been here in awhile and decided to bring my dad before a flyers game. We decided to just get a buncha different things to try. We started with buffalo wings + spicy chicken empanadas. We also ordered the Mac and cheese and the brisket grilled cheese which came with house cut fries. 

The wings were cooked well, coulda been a little more crispy IMO, but they were good and the sauce was delicious. The spicy chicken empanadas were really good  they added crispy but not greasy at all! The brisket grilled cheeese was on sourdough bread and it was put together perfectly. It was not overly cheesy and had the right amount of meat. Their fries are hand cut and we&apos;re nice and crispy! All servings were a good size and we had plenty of leftovers which we gave to someone on the street."
3,"I&apos;ve been told Good Dog Bar is a relatively popular pub bar in center city Philadelphia and had decent Yelp reviews, so we decided to come here for some dinner and drinks. Given the ongoing COVID pandemic, this place currently only have outdoor seating, but there are plenty set up. Since it&apos;s in center city, parking might be hard to find. The inside is very pub-like and dim, as you would expect, with lots of pictures of dogs! Service was rather good, and we had a super friendly server who knows the menu well and gave great recommendations. I&apos;m a huge fan of deviled eggs, and the ones they have were pretty good with a decent portion of filling (which is great!). My friend had the Good Dog burger, and he said it wasn&apos;t that &quot;special.&quot; The server recommended the wings, so I ended up ordering them. There are 8 moderate-sized wings that is in traditional buffalo sauce. To be honest, this smothered my wings so it was a little too wet for me, and the taste also wasn&apos;t that special. I guess the food pretty much made this a 3-star rating. However, my experience wasn&apos;t bad, so I do plan on coming back again hopefully when the inside is open so I can actually experience this pub to its fullest!

Rating: 6/10
Pros: Staff
Cons: Food isn&apos;t that unique/special
Recommendations: Deviled eggs"
3,"When it comes to burgers I have been spoiled as &quot;Lucky&apos;s Last Chance&quot; was a two minute walk from me in the days I lived in Manayunk so I have high standards when it comes to burgers.

I went with the Good Dog Burger that has a blue cheese type flavor cheese that is cooked in the ample sized burger that has carmelized onions on top. The burger is quality but not go out of my way for type burger. They have a nice selection of beers here to choose from but I have to be honest its always a hassle to try and flag down a bartender for a drink.

I would only come back here if I am straving for food which I was today. From what I hear they have some quality bar food and there specials menu which I didn&apos;t see until after I ordered had some interesting options including a tuna tarte, keep in mind the price points were priced high as fuck at around $18.

Won&apos;t be running back."
5,"Calling all dog lovers! This place has the cutest dog decor hanging up. I didn&apos;t know that was the reason behind the restaurant&apos;s name, but once you walk in, you&apos;ll see walls covered in dogs. 

Went in on a Sunday afternoon with a friend. It looked crowded inside, but they seated us upstairs which had ample seating and a full bar. 

I checked out the menu beforehand, and I knew I wanted to try the vegan cheesesteak. To start, though, my friend and I ordered deviled eggs. Not bad. They tasted like they had bacon bits in them? I don&apos;t recall seeing that on the description, but either way, they were good. I also got a strawberry beer on draft which was excellent and my friend ordered the Bye Felicia cocktail. 

Now on to the good stuff! Vegan cheesesteak, two thumbs ALL the way up. It was cheesy and savory. The bread was soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. They use sesame rolls for their sandwiches and although it&apos;s different, it&apos;s quite delicious. Will be trying that at home from now on. 

Definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for decent drinks and yummy bar fare. Kudos to our server who complimented me on my personalized debit card. He got a kick out of the picture I had on there. Too funny. I&apos;ll be back for some more puppy love!"
3,"Came here after seeing a musical. Perfect walking distance. When we arrived we were seating immediately. It seems that the bar is about three levels with a good amount of seating on each floor and lots of TVs if you are trying to watch football. We both thought it was nice if you were trying to watch the game but also chat with friends because it wasn&apos;t extremely loud. 

To start we ordered the raclette which was by far our favorite thing. It came out in a skillet hot and was delicious. Perfect for two people to share. My bf got the Sly Fox Lager and really enjoyed it. Ended up getting two. They had a bunch of game day specials and food and drink. For our main meal we got the kielbasa sandwich which was HUGE but if you don&apos;t love spicy mustard you may want to ask without and the stuff burger which was just okay. I didn&apos;t like the cheese that was on the inside of the burger but that could be just preference. Both came with fries which were really good. 

Not sure if I would come back and but I did love all the photos of doggos on the walls."
5,"Everything was awesome, except parking.   Oh well.   The staff was super friendly and energetic.   The food was great

Good Burger - We added bacon.   Definitely do that. 
Fries - Tasty.   
Apple salad - A little too much cheese, but besides that it was excellent. 
Mac n Cheese - Perfect.   My daughter loved it. 
Cornbread - YES!

Wife and I split the salad, burger, and fries.   It was plenty of food for both of us. 
If you do not come here, you&apos;re making a huge mistake."
5,"Well there is a story to this but I&apos;m sure you don&apos;t have time for it. &apos;&apos;This place was on Diners dives and drive ins. 
So it was on my to do list since Im in Philly!  
Check in to the place and was a pretty good crowd. Find us a place in a booth. And checked out the menu. 
Waitress said try the chicken legs. I&apos;m not a big fan of chicken legs. But... what the heck. I&apos;ll try it. 
Let me tell you. Great presentation, great flavor and just enough. I liked it. I liked it a lot!  
So if you are in philly, even though nothing from the show is still on the menu it was worth the stop. I didn&apos;t hate it. Go by tell them the guy from Yelp sent you. They won&apos;t do nothing for you. But it will start the conversation."
5,"Some days you just NEED a burger...and a great local bar spot...and something cold to drink with the first two.  The Good Dog bar fills that need.  Grab a seat at the bar, people there are always friendly (on both sides).  Wednesday is also half-price can day!  I enjoyed a cold cider, their renowned cheese-filled burger...crunchy fries and some great smiles.  And if you&apos;re a dog lover, you&apos;ll love all the pup pics on the walls.  If you are looking for a local feel center-city bar with great food; GDB is the place to go.

PS:  Their wings are also HOT and a must try too."
5,"I want to give Good Dog 4 stars but I don&apos;t know why.  Nothing is amazing, but for a nice, comfortable bar, with good food, reasonable prices and a nice beer selection, I&apos;m not really sure what else I&apos;m asking for.  

Pros:

Service is friendly and efficient.  Drinks were replaced quickly, food came out fast and hot and our server was happy to provide recommendations and discuss the menu.  It&apos;s worth noting that we got a carafe of water when we sat down - not normal in a bar setting, but something I like as we got perilously tiny water glasses!

The beer and cocktail menu is okay.  They have a decent rotating beer list and a few inventive cocktails.  Good Dog isn&apos;t quite a dive, but it&apos;s got a dive feel and this menu is in line with that; a step above (or maybe a half step).

The food was great.  My wife and I both had the Good Dog Burger, which featured a chunk of roquefort cheese in the middle - our server was sure to warn us about the bleu cheesiness, but I enjoyed it quite a bit.  Nonetheless, the warning is noteworthy as others may not like it.  The fries were average, but very acceptable and we were served with a side of garlic aioli (but really, just garlicky mayo).  It was enjoyable all the same.  Our friend had the ahi tuna tacos, which she enjoyed and found fresh.  

Prices were all reasonable for the area.

Cons:

Prices and specials were mediocre on an otherwise slow night and Happy Hour doesn&apos;t really feature anything that screams &quot;come here, not there.&quot;  But the food and quality helps. 

Conclusion:

Good Dog is a welcoming, comfortable bar that served good comfort food at a &quot;i&apos;m not getting shafted for this location&quot; price.  Service was excellent and fast and we come back with a little regularity.  We&apos;ll be back again, I&apos;m sure.  

Also, Dogs are awesome."
4,"I come here during the week in the middle of the day when I need cold beer (or more) and a burger.  The bartender is a cool dude, so that helps too.  I&apos;m a fan of thin burgers and Good Dog does not serve those, but the Good Dog Burger makes me forget that I don&apos;t like fat ass burgers.  It&apos;s stuffed with roquefort cheese, topped with caramelized onions and served with fries.  Add bacon because that makes everything better.  

I can&apos;t speak to the rest of the food because once I tried this burger I was sold and just can&apos;t bear to not order it when I visit.  It&apos;s just that good."
4,"After a long day of sight seeing, it was time to eat. But where do you go in a city you know nothing about? You goto Yelp, that&apos;s where! I saw a couple of Yelp friends came to &quot;Good Dog Bar&quot; and loved it. They raved about the burger. So armed with this knowledge, I made my way to the restaurant. I noticed Philadelphia isn&apos;t much for exterior presentation. Maybe it&apos;s because the restaurant has been there forever or maybe it&apos;s the look they&apos;re going for. Either way, it was no Roman colosseum. 
Inside, the place was long, seems to be the theme in most restaurants. It was also crowded. This was fine, they found seating for us right away. Looking over the menu I loved that it was simple and to the point. It said to me, &quot;man, meet meat! Meat meet man!&quot; It was easy. I settled on a stuffed burger and some mac &amp; cheese. The mac was a appetizer and it delivered. It was really delicious. They called it creamy and that&apos;s how it was. I was excited for my burger at this point. When my burger finally came, it was thick, I mean really thick. The bacon was as well. I thought about not even trying to eat it, but voted against my better judgment. I enjoyed the burger as well. It was juicy and flavorful. The stuffed blue cheese inside made it one for the books. I couldn&apos;t think of anything else except that burger. Once it was finished I threw it a farewell service. It definitely impacted my life. I would definitely return, I loved the food and the service. The building may not be flashy, but it brings you in one burger at a time."
5,"Shout out to Eva! I picked this place because it was less than a block from our hotel and I desperately needed a beer after a long drive on the turnpike. Found out they had a vegan Philly cheesesteak on the menu so that was bonus too. They had a nice selection of draught beers and mixed drinks, but the real star turned out to be the vegan cheesesteak. It was... wow! Seriously, I would drive the turnpike again just to have that sandwich! Service was amazing too; our server, Eva, walked her legs off going back and forth to the kitchen (seating was outside) and she always had a cheerful attentive attitude."
4,"tl;dr a trendy dog-themed gastropub with one of Philly&apos;s consistency delicious burgers

On a block monopolized by millennial hotspots like Max Brenner and Howl at the Moon, Good Dog Bar is a place that you walk by without a second glance. But those in the know will tell you that this unassuming joint is one of the better gastropubs in the city.

Good Dog&apos;s unique decor walks a fine line between &quot;dive bar&quot; and &quot;hipster.&quot; The dimly lit space feels cozy with its stamped tin ceilings and dark-stained wooden shiplap. The long bar stretches across one side of the restaurant, echoed by a series of booths on the other. Industrial bilobed lights are placed between the countess black-and-white canine portraits speckled about the wall.

I&apos;ve been here a number of times, and the experience has been consistent. During this past lunch visit with my partner, I decided to stick with the tried-and-true Good Dog Burger: a giant patty stuffed with melty Roquefort cheese and topped with sweet caramelized onions. Each ingredient oozed into a deliciously messy bite. My only gripe is that the brioche bun was not toasted to give a little texture to a somewhat soggy meal. Beyond the burger, I received some alarming news on this visit: Good Dog decided to discontinue their sweet potato fries. The regular fries and tangy garlic aioli hit the spot, but the dish won&apos;t ever quite be the same again.

While the food is always the move, the not-quite-attentive and not-quite-friendly service always leaves something to be desired. Don&apos;t expect anything beyond formalities -- but for just around $15 for arguably the best burger in the city, Good Dog is a must-try."
