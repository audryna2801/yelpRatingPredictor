4,"I love AYCE hot pot and kbbq and this place has the best of both worlds. I don&apos;t know a lot of places that do both, so this place already gets bonus points for that. When I went, we just opted to do hotpot since we didn&apos;t feel like kbbq. We were seated rather quickly and was able to start ordering. We did the benz pot with pig bone, spicy, and mushroom broth (all the broths were pretty good). They have a good variety of things you can order (fish balls, thin sliced beef, mussels, etc; basically the usual things for hotpot). Their condiment bar also had a wide variety of options. Everyone was respectful and was wearing their masks when using the condiment station. Overall, we had a pretty good experience and left feeling like we didn&apos;t need to eat hotpot for a least a month. Judging from the other reviews it looks like they do BYOB here and they offer free hotpot on your birthday with valid ID (minimum 2 guest). Next time, I&apos;ll try out their kbbq and see if it&apos;s as good as their hotpot!"
5,Food was fresh. And everyone was practicing Covid precautions.  Mask are mandatory and all staff are wearing masks.
4,"Lot of options for both meat eaters and vegetarians. Hot pot was great for the vegetarian and bbq was awesome for grilling meat, shrimp, mushrooms and steak. You def get your money&apos;s worth..."
1,"Update: ***You should never offer compensation (discounts and freebies) in exchange for reviews.***
This is the reason why this establishment has so many reviews!!
Aggressive review solicitation at Nine Ting Restaurant, incentivizing customers to leave a review or check in to get a FREE ICE CREAM leads to biased ratings. Signs at every table and every corner of this restaurant for customers to write positive reviews of its services on consumer-review platforms like Yelp, Google, and Facebook to improve their online reputation... I am pretty sure this is ILLEGAL!
Do yourself a favor do not go to this restaurant that resorts to these tactics to get reviews... go to a restaurant that rightfully earned its great reputation, where consumers share their genuine experiences--without being asked or tempted. Thank you.


THE WAITER DESPERATE TO VIEW THE CHECKBOOK TO ANALYZE THE $$ TIP AMOUNT. $$ 

We went for a birthday dinner combo bbq + hot pot. I ordered the tomato broth but the hot pot soup I was given which was a mushroom broth, was incorrect. I absolutely hate mushrooms.  I was told by the waiter that the broth can not be switched out and that I was stuck with it.
We only had 1 round of bbq because our waiter was nowhere to be found to order more food.
Upon closing out our check, we had to validate that it was in fact a &quot;birthday&quot; dinner with a driver&apos;s license.
Even though the service was mediocre,  I left a VERY GENEROUS TIP.

As I was gathering my belongings standing up from the table and layering up with my winter coat and mask...

THE WAITER DESPERATE TO VIEW THE CHECKBOOK TO ANALYZE THE TIP AMOUNT was watching  me impatiently to walk out.

The waiter stood incredibly close to me for about 4 minutes ...VIOLATING SOCIAL DISTANCING ...until I took a few steps to exit--the waiter immediately jumped behind me to snatch the checkbook like a vulture and took a look right as I took 1 step away from the table.
W.O.W. how rude! At least wait until we leave to review the TIP amount, not while we are still in sight and less than 6ft. distance.

Lucky, for the waiter I left A VERY GENEROUS TIP, however, the principle of stalking your clients and shoving/ rushing them out the door is incredibly disrespectful.  In hindsight, I would have left &quot;NO TIP, &quot; had I known how inappropriate the behavior would be after filling out the TIP amount.

I am only giving 2 stars because the food was ok. But the service was horrendous ...
I  did read the reviews prior to giving this place a try and but as it turns out,  I too have been a victim of TERRIBLE SERVICE. 

****No FREE birthday dinner buffet with the purchase of 1 dinner buffet is worth the disrespect you will receive from the wait staff. ****"
3,"I am a huge fan of Korean BBQ so this was some place I just needed to try while I was in Philly. But I was just overall disappointed in this place. 

To start off with the tables are old and kind of falling apart. Or maybe our table caught on fire? I have no idea but not visually appealing. 

For the food, not that large of a selection to pick from. I did like that their was a seafood pancake option. It was good, not very seafood-ish but tasty. For meats, my favorite was the beef filet. Very nice pieces of meat, cooked really well and were just tasty. We also got pork belly, it was just okay, and marinated beef short ribs. The short ribs were marinated in a great sauce but overall the pieces we were given were all fat and cartilage. I&apos;d rather not have to fight to take a bite out of something so I left those to my brother. We got some veggies to cook on the grill just as filler. 

The biggest disappointment of this place were the sides. Which are usually the best part of Korean bbq this place basically didn&apos;t even try with sides. Kimchi, peanuts seaweed salad and edamame. Nothing fun or special. 

What I did like about this place was the sauce bar. Not very covid friendly but they have a great selection of different sauces to use. Loved the homemade chili oil!"
4,"Pleasantly surprised, at a time when things are tough and restrictions are everywhere this was fun, clean, quiet and had plenty to offer.  They are cautious for the times but professional in their approach to everything. Great selection to choose from whether it was Pot fillers or items to grill. Food was plentiful and you can eat as much as you can by simply asking for more of what you want. Excellent service as the waiter helped us navigate through the menu and was very attentive during our meal to a point of grilling our food while we  talked, laughed and &quot;yelped&quot; it up. A real treat if you ask me."
4,"Although I&apos;ve been charmed by KPot. Nineting is still one of top favorite Hot pot places to go to. Idk if it&apos;s the atmosphere or just the food. I always have a great time. However, food quality is not always consistent, thus a star deducted. I&apos;ll still go if anyone invites me! Haha"
4,"I&apos;m a bit of a hot pot whore, and felt like nine ting was okay for a hot pot place. I wasn&apos;t a fan of the original soup base that I got- but the portions that I got for each order was surprisingly large!! I ordered a ton of food and with the right type of sauce left with a full stomach and a happy soul! I would just recommend trying a different soup base"
4,"I haven&apos;t been here and years and was not disappointed, the quality and service is still going steady. My boyfriend and I arrived at around 6 PM on a Friday and we did not have to wait for a table. We opted in for just all you can eat hot pot which was $24.99 pp.
Our waiter was super attentive with when to refill our water our our soup base. He also checked in to see if we wanted to order more food. 
However, when we were ready for our check which was around 7:00 PM and the place was more busy, the service was lacking. It took about 15 minutes for us to get the check and have them process and bring it back. Definitely coming back on off hours again."
5,"Incredible Korean restaurant! It&apos;s all you can eat, but after the first serving I was stuffed. I ordered the AYCE hot pot and got the kimchi/tomato soups with prawns, udon noodles, and more. The only downside is they forgot the beef that I requested, but I had so much food at my table that it didn&apos;t even matter. They have a serve yourself toppings wall with jalape√±os, bbq sauce, and other spices to add to your food. The menu is by QR code only which is unique and helps cut down on paper waste. I would definitely come back the next time I am in Chinatown."
4,"Great place for a fun dining experience with a group of friends.  I&apos;ve been here a few times and have tried the BBQ and hot pot, and enjoyed both! 
 Every table gets a bowl or two of white rice and they have a sauce bar towards the back of the restaurant with a ton of good options to complement whatever you are cooking up. HIGHLY recommend ordering the pineapple to grill up...feel like it can get overlooked sometimes!  The service can be a bit pushy, but I think its because they are busy and trying to turn tables quicker.   Definitely do all you can eat if you visit, and don&apos;t forget a bottle of wine because its BYOB ;)  

and......DON&apos;T FORGET TO BUTTER THE GRILL BETWEEN COOKING!"
5,"Had an awesome group dinner experience in one of the private rooms at Nine Ting.  Almost everyone chose to have both hot pot and BBQ.  We had two grills and individual hot pots to work with, and ended up eating ourselves silly.  
The 20% tip is automatically added to the bill, so it ended up being around $40 per person.  
One last word to the wise: always remember to butter between grilling sessions.  No one likes blackened meat that sticks to the grill."
1,"I ate hot pot there. I felt really sick. I got stomachache and diarrhea. Plus, the side dishes taste old. Hope the soup they use is fresh....."
5,Incredible food! Would highly recommend! Great and fast service. High quality meats. 10/10 yummy
4,"The best Korean barbecue in Philly area. The meat is always marinated just right and the house barbecue sauce is solid. 
Went with a couple of friends and was sat in after about 20-30 mins. You choose either barbecue, hotpot or both. 
Staff and servers are nice and friendly. 

Will come back when I need more meat."
1,"First, 28.99 per person Korean bbq is what we have today!

Overall conclusion: 
Too bad yelp didn&apos;t have 0 stars! I think they should get the app improvement because some of the places needed those rating!

I WOULD NOT COME AGAIN AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!

Foods/tasteless:
Steaks barely marinated,plain steak! 
Ribs are not marinated the Korean way.
Lamb is decent, veggies are the okay part but only 6 options available.
The gave you like a cube of butter as greaser of meats cooking.( **no one cares if you run out of it, you needed to tell them give you another if you run out because the waiter/waitresses team have big business to talk about by the stairway**)
The food is very soso,chicken wings are not fresh. Me and my friend tasted rotten/weird taste of it (it like poultry that sit in the fridge for long time)

Service and experience:
Me and my friend try to tell the staff kindly and they said there&apos;s no problem with it(about the chicken wings). We asked to see the manager or owner for the night and one of the waiter tell me manager/owner are not here and WALK AWAY FROM ME. 

It&apos;s our first time eating at a bbq place where the waiters are just standing right next to us and do nothing while the food is burned. First time ever that we needed to cook ourselves the meal we are paying for 30$ per person. The waiter/waitresses just brought you the ingredients from the kitchen!

LISTEN! If I wanna cook for myself I WOULD NOT GO TO A RESTAURANT! That&apos;s the purpose I pay for pricy foods and service. 

I feel sad for the ownership of this place because they are paying server to talk and walk instead of serving the customers who PAY TIPS WITHOUT SERVICE! 

Lastly, I have no idea where the 4 stars rating come from!

Good luck with the business!"
2,"Like the idea of the combined hotpot/BBQ tabling style, but that just means they&apos;re jack-of-all-trades, master of none. Also got a stomach virus the very first time I came here, so I wouldn&apos;t recommend going again. Of course, all of Chinatown&apos;s health grades are verifiably shoddy at best, but you have to consider the taste vs. food poisoning likelihood ratio, and this place just wasn&apos;t it.

We had the hotpot for our table, and were offered generous servings of AYCE raw foods, and gave our pick of 3 broths: original, bone broth, and tomato. All of these were near flavorless, and as the waiters kept pouring in water refills, it eventually became a watered down mess. The dipping station was fine, though, with great variety, but that&apos;s about all the merit there is to it. The service is cordial and fine, it&apos;s just the food that doesn&apos;t hit it. Take caution when coming here, like all Chinatown spots."
4,This place has such a good variety of items and condiments for hot pot and bbq. Really enjoyed my visit. short ribs and duck were my fave.
4,"I treated here for a birthday dinner.Mostly because they have a &quot;Birthday Special&quot;.  
(That guest eats FREE with I.  D)We were seated right away! It was packed.Decent selection of meats and sauces! The seaweed salad was delicious. As with most. The meats start out plentiful and diminish toward the end. But your stuffed by then and to full to cook for yourself anymore!!!They even offer a small gift for the birthday guest!"
4,"You&apos;re paying for an experience.. they have different sauces to give your food flavors, it&apos;s byob and the Food was decent .. I went with girlfriends to celebrate for a birthday.. would I go again? Ehh probably.. wasn&apos;t bad but I wasn&apos;t too impressed either .."
