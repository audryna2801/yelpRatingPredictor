5,"Dinner came with easy to follow cooking instructions - this is how Takeout should be!  Hard to be more fresh than when you&apos;re preparing (heating it up) yourself. All items are packed cold, with reheating instructions.

We chose 1 of the weekly, 3 course $45 dinners. This included a Potato and Shrimp Salad with red onions, capers and eggs in sauce Aurore.  It was simple and delicious.

The next course was an Olive Oil poached Cod Fish Loin with slivered carrots, zucchini, fennel and ginger with an Orange Vinaigrette.  This was also delicious.

Since we were just sharing the one 3 course dinner, we added another entree, which was amazing. The Quenelle de Poisson was a soufflé-like Fish Mousse glazed in a rosy lobster cream.  With everything being delicious, this was still the winner! 

We also ordered Baguettes.

Dinner ended with a fantastic Baba au Rhum dessert - Pineapple Rum cake.

For a future Cassoulet dinner we also ordered Tarbais beans and 2 Duck Leg confit.

Obviously it&apos;s not the same as being at Bibou but still an exceptional dinner.  

For the above with tip the bill came to around $130."
5,Last night I ordered the take out menu. When I brought it home it did not look like that much but I will tell you everything was so delicious. There was plenty of food and these were dishes I could not replicate.  This is definitely a place to try to turn this period of time when you have to order takeout
5,Amazing amazing amazing.  We ordered the whole menu!!! Lmao  no regrets at all!!! Love this place and this family ....  amazing ! Period!!!  French food
5,"This was a lovely place to celebrate half a year of marriage!

It&apos;s a prix-fixe tasting menu, BYOB. I brought a French white and a French red, which paired well with our French meal!

Every course and the service was impeccable. The amuse bouche consisted of 3 petite bites - a crab cake, a gougère, and fancy apple. The servers kept our wine cold in the back and refilled our glasses often. They came around several times with bread - 3 options including warm mini baguettes (the best)."
5,"The restaurant is easy to miss in the neighborhood. There&apos;s a free lot next door but we had to wait for the first seating to finish before we could get a spot. The menu changes weekly. 

Our dinner was for my sisters bday and they brought special treats for her with a bday candle at the end. The seven courses were amazing although I still don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be craving foie gras anytime soon. The staff and chef were friendly and put us st ease. 

Pace yourself for about a 2-3hr dinner though, and bring your appetite."
4,"A mom and pop haute cuisine shop. Hey that rhymes! 

The first thing that stood out to me was the small, yet homey feel of the place. Although its commercial property, theres also a residential feel. The service was definitely on par with Michelin star status. There were two servers in particular that watched over my table from afar like a hawk. Every moment I moved my plate or got down to a third of my glass, they were there to immediately accommodate.  

The amuse bouche were superb. The thing I noticed was each item had one strong ingredient with every other item only elevating that specific flavor. The brioche with foie gras mouse mostly had a buttery taste. The shrimp had a lovely seafood taste, but the other items didn&apos;t pop but rather pushed the main flavor. This isn&apos;t to say I didn&apos;t like it, but rather a pattern I noticed.  

The bouef was a nice dish where the roastbeef-like meat was paired well with pickled veggies and cured yolk.  

The crab melon was a great concept that&apos;s main goal was staying light and refreshing. I would have liked to see a stronger crab taste, but that&apos;s usually how French cuisine is: more conservative than bold. I felt there could have been either more pieces of melon or less crab soup. Once I ate through the melon, I felt I was left with a disproportionate amount of soup. The Thai basil was a lovely touch.  

The Arctic char was fantastic. The fish, caviar, and verbena blended all well together while standing out separately. The verbana emulsion was a great way to add flavor while giving this airy mouthfeel, as if my food had washed up right on the shore! Every bite had a strong, lasting flavor well after I was done eating it.  

For the foie gras, there was this lovely tag team of corn and almond that I would normally scoff at, but this was well executed. The sweet mealiness of the almond emulsion and corn purée and cornbread worked. Along with the light accent notes of saltiness vinegar from the green almonds. The plum soaked in sake was such a good idea. An earthy sweetness that had a boozy backdrop. In a weird way, I feel like this is how native americans would have made foie gras (especially if there was squash or turkey thrown in the mix.) 

They brought out this palate cleanser that was fancy water ice made of rosé and lychee. IIt did the job and had a pleasant taste.  

The duck was probably my least favorite item. Not because it was terrible, but because it didn&apos;t have much flavor. The sauce was nice, but I was hoping the duck would have a pronounced  flavor. The texture was just right though, where its tender but still has some density.  

The peach souffle was fantastic!! Maybe one of the best souffles Ive had in structure and taste. The peach flavor was ripe and sweet, with a full body peach taste. The souffle itself was beautiful in its crystallized edge and flawless geometric shape. With every stab of my spoon, I felt I was ruining something beautiful. The eggy, sugary outside was a real treat. The sweetness level was definitely European, yet was still pronounced enough to be bold in flavor.  

I admit, this place is quite conservative and stuffy at times because of the formal appearance and stoic servers. But theres still a charm to it, from the mom and pop feel, to  especially the menu. I wouldn&apos;t put this as an absolute must for visitors to come here, but for locals, I highly recommend it."
5,"I dont know why people are saying &quot;try this!&quot;. Unless you&apos;re a local, they have a set menu for the week. That being said, wonderful experience. The food was excellent and an adventure. The service was great without being pretentious. It feels like you stopped into a small portal into a French home...esp since the restaurant is surrounded by random shops. (Not easy to find!!) If you&apos;re not super wealthy like us, save up for this as a special occasion. It&apos;s a whole evening!"
5,"Food is original and amazing. 

Quaint restaurant in a cute little neighborhood. I think I counted 7 tables total when we dined including a large group of about 6 or 7 guys. 

I don&apos;t live in Philly but the BYOB (Bring Your Own Bottle) at many establishments like this is nice. 

Prix fixe menu only. The portions are small, but you won&apos;t leave hungry. I promise. 

Every dish is thoughtfully planned out. 

Chef Pierre Calmels comes by after to greet you. This is a nice touch at any restaurant. He said they use seasonal ingredients so the menu changes all the time. 

Highly recommend if you are in the area."
5,"As always, a superlative experience at bibou. Exquisite food, personable and attentive service .  Chef Calmels and his wife Charlotte are holding strong during a very challenging time. Chef Calmels dishes  are like nothing you get elsewhere.  A top tier dining experience."
5,"Everything was great.  The food was unique and delicious from first course to the last.  The service was perfect.  Attentive, professional and helpful.   My husband doesnt like fish and they were very accomodating.  you just need to let them know ahead of time about any allergies or dislikes.   I highly recommend Bibou.  The owner comes out and talks to every guest. A lot of thought and talent went into making the very interesting menu.   Menu does change weekly, which I love because as wonderful as each course was, I can&apos;t wait to go back and see what they come up with next time.

Since Le Bec FIn closed we haven&apos;t found a classic French restaurant that even came close.  Bibou does.   

Everyone should try this restaurant at least once.
My husband and I are both graduates of the Culinary Institute of America so we do know good food."
4,"My boyfriend took me here on a date. It was a wonderful first fine dining experience. The staff were very attentive. I loved everything on the menu that night, my favorite was the foie gras and veal with truffles. Everything on the menu was made to perfection. Before going in, they asked for food restrictions and bec I&apos;m allergic to most fruits, they changed the menu to fit my diet."

5,"My husband and I came here for a date night and sat at the counter overlooking the kitchen. So many wonderful things to say about our evening! This is a byob (bring your own bottle(s) of wine) restaurant. Jeffery, the front manager chatted with us during our meal, sharing about the food, restaurant and just good conversation. The tasting menu changes weekly and Wednesday is considered day 1 of the new menu. Each plate that was served was exquisite, perfectly plated, seasoned and cooked. Chef Pierre came out to talk with us and was very pleasant and personable. The restaurant was very very clean which I am super picky about. Someday I would love to go back!"
4,"I wish there was an option for 4.5 stars because that&apos;s what my rating would be. I can&apos;t quite give Bibou 5 stars... Most of the food was incredibly delicious with a few dishes that weren&apos;t. The foie gras was definitely my favorite. It was rich and tender and delicious. The short rib was in this amazingly rich cream soup that was also one of my favorites. The oysters were pretty good. The fish and partridge was just alright for me. We also added the summer truffles to the partridge which added a rich flavor but was still not amazing for me. The dessert was where things were really not that great. The dessert was a grape soufflé and I think the grape was where the dish went wrong for me. The cream part of the soufflé was delicious. It was just the grape in the cake like part that wasn&apos;t very good. 

Ok now for the atmosphere. This place had a quaint but pretentious feel about it. A lot of the waitstaff were not quite rude but definitely looking down on most of the patrons (which I suppose is kinda french so maybe this was the intended effect). I felt like our waiter was judging us throughout the meal and made me feel like I didn&apos;t belong at this fancy restaurant. Almost everyone there had this smug air about them that was very off putting for me. 

Overall I think that (most of) the food was amazing but I couldn&apos;t get over the awkward vibes I was getting. I would probably come back but not for awhile considering there are many other great food places in the city where I would feel more welcomed."
5,The best Foie Gras I have ever tasted. So tender and still full of flavor. The overall atmosphere is wonderfully romantic. So good for a date. And it is BYOB! Don&apos;t forget your drink!
2,"While delighted to see that it appears that Bibou is doing so well in these coronavirus times that are challenging for many restaurants, so that it can have the same voice mail for 4 days, when one calls to order the menu for the week, saying to call &quot;tomorrow&quot; after 11 and please don&apos;t leave a message since they do pile up, then on the 5th day get a vm saying that as of the afternoon of the day before, all meals are sold out, that was vexing. Is there a secret phone number? I called every day repeatedly or 4 days. Whatever. Other very good restaurants are happy for the business and accessible. I was delighted with the food, attention, and service from Pumpkin."
5,This is one of those restaurants where you can only do the chef&apos;s tasting menu and you are having whatever is being served that evening. Sounds super fun to me.Every course that came to our table this night was pretty amazing.  I would run through the menu course by course but since it changes weekly what would be the point. I did include a picture of the menu with my review so if you are curious see that. Just know that you leave this restaurant feeling like you got what you paid for. Will be back.
4,"Fine French dining in South Philly that is BYOB. Other reviews state &quot;cash only&quot; which is not true. We went here for date night and it was an all around good experience. The wait staff was friendly and the food was excellent. At the end of the night we were even greater by Chef Calmels. The menu was $115 prix fixe with several stars in my opinion: 

1) Marinated scallop with smoked truffle vinaigrette 
2) Aged NY strip
3) Tarentaise &quot;aligot&quot;
4) Hot fig soufflé"
5,"Absolutely the best restaurant experience I have had in Philadelphia. This review goes back to when they used to do the special priced dinner on Sundays. I have not been able to go in a while and they have continued to increased their dinner price making it a bit above my price range. That being said, I had some of the best food of my life when I dined here and I guarantee you will be similarly pleased if you go now! Everything from the service to the food itself is perfectly done. The chef is phenomenal and the foie gras was simply the best I have had. The dishes are inventive but familiar in a comforting way, well balanced with flavor and texture. The courses are expertly timed and all of the nice touches expected of a fine dining establishment are there. Would 10/10 go back if only I wasn&apos;t living on my student budget!"
5,Tiny corner property BYOB  that needs to be booked well in advance. The 7 course pre-fix menu changes weekly so it&apos;s totally up to the chef. He also comes out to introduce himself towards the end of the meal. It&apos;s very authentic French meal w/ excellent service!
