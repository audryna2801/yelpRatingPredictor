5,"Best kept secret and honestly so underrated, Franklin Mortgage is one of the best cocktail bars in the city. So glad indoor seating is open again. It&apos;s dark and intimate,  the music is great and the mixologist are down to earth and personable. It&apos;s low key but high key a vibe."
5,"Great ambience, attentive servers, and a spectacular drink menu. The mood is dark and sultry and you WILL be banned if you are on your phone."
3,"Although something happened on my recent visit, this is still one of my favorite bars in the US because I think it&apos;s the only real emulation of a speakeasy from prohibition era. I say that because there&apos;s a guy (bouncer) who is dressed in attire appropriate to the times, the inside is very dim (gotta hide from the authorities), and they have a lot of rare/vintage alcohol.

The drinks are simply amazing and high quality so expect a higher price tag. I came one night without much expectation and happily ordered a $34 cocktail because I found value in the concoction. While it was worth it to me, it&apos;s probably not a random happy hour place you just casually go to with your buds.

Anyway, the thing that happened was overcharging me for $9 for the tip. Could&apos;ve been an honest mistake, but it always makes me wonder how many times that &quot;mistake&quot; happens with hopes the customer doesn&apos;t notice."
3,"This place has really gone downhill I don&apos;t know what happened to it. This used to be one of our favorite bars in Philly to come to. I think it has gone downhill ever since they changed the name to The Franklin bar, it used to be The Franklin Mortgage and Investment Company. And once they added the upstairs tiki bar. I don&apos;t know if it switched owners or managers or what. 

Speaking of tiki bar, the doorman asked us a couple times if we wanted to get a drink at the tiki bar rather than wait for the downstairs bar. Seems like they&apos;re really trying to push the tiki bar. We said no because we wanted to relax and sit at a table downstairs. 

Well it wasn&apos;t relaxing downstairs at all. It was so hot down there it felt like I was in a sauna. I was going to complain but it was hard enough getting a waiter to take our drink order. Also there was club music playing so loud I had to scream at my husband for him to hear me. When did this place become a dance club and not a speakeasy? Are they trying to compete with the other speakeasies by making this one different? This just makes people want to go to other places. 

Our waiter eventually came over and took our drink order. I ordered the part time fluffer full time lover drink with peanut butter bourbon, graham cracker liquor, coconut, vanilla, cream and egg white. I was expecting it to taste kind of like the with a baseball bat drink that we had before but this drink was much sweeter. Didn&apos;t even taste the bourbon much at all, but it had good flavor I enjoyed it. They toasted marshmallows on top too which I liked.

We wanted a second drink but it took forever for someone to take our order again. We were almost ready to throw cash down and leave. Eventually our waiter that brought out our first drinks comes over to bring us water and asks if we&apos;re ok. We said we wanted another drink and he says ok well someone will be over to take our order. What? Wasn&apos;t he our waiter? He took our order earlier. He was still waiting on the tables right next to us. We end up giving our order to another girl that comes over and we cash out after our next drink order. Our original &quot;waiter&quot; that apparently wasn&apos;t supposed to be waiting on us brought those new drinks out to us. Drinks were good but we were ready to leave. 

Also i went to use the bathroom and there was water all over the floor it got my purse wet. Gross. 

Bottom line drinks are 4 stars but service is 1-2 stars. I&apos;m being generous with the 3 star review really it should be a 2.5 stars. Even the drinks don&apos;t seem quite as creative as they used to be. 

It&apos;s a shame. Don&apos;t know if this is a server issue or management issue but something needs to be fixed. Seems like totally unorganized and lack of communication. I think maybe they are trying to push people in and out as fast as they can to maximize profit. Not sure if we will come back might just stick to Charlie&apos;s from now on."
4,"This speakeasy is a fun and intimate basement bar for drinks or grub.

Like any good hole-in-the-wall, it&apos;s easy to miss from the outside. You need to go down a flight of steps and enter below ground. The prohibition-era vibe is cool, and the people are nice, plus the drinks are unique and enjoyable.

Overall a neat place to hang with friends over a cocktail."
5,"Beautiful drinks in a discrete beautiful setting with beautiful music! I cannot rave enough about this place. 

It hasn&apos;t disappointed- you get high quality and well curated cocktails. Of course the price reflects that, but still reasonable. We sat in the downstairs area on a Saturday night and the music was poppin! I thought it&apos;d be more loungy and smooth but it was more hip hop chill vibes. I don&apos;t know if this makes sense so you&apos;re just going to have to try it for yourself. 

I forgot the name of the drink that I chose, but I asked the server to recommend something refreshing and I loved it! It had wasabi in it- something I was weary about but so glad I tried. You also can&apos;t go wrong with the good ol&apos; old fashioned."
4,"Can&apos;t believe I haven&apos;t written a review for Franklin before! In my opinion, cocktail bars are about the vibe, the music, and of course - the drinks. 

This is a below ground level bar - we had to wait about 20-25min to get in on a Saturday night. But after getting in, the vibe was definitely cozy. They had a cocktail menu which, although not too long, had some interesting choices. Me and my friends all enjoyed our well crafted drinks and the music was a nice modern mix (think along the lines of Childish Gambino&apos;s Redbone) which encouraged talking, but was there to sway to and relax as well.

The prices are on the pricier end, but that&apos;s hardly unexpected from a high quality cocktail bar, that too in the Rittenhouse area! Perfect place to chill and have not just some good drinks, but a conversation as well."
5,"So far, my favorite cocktail bar in the city. Incredibly easy to miss unless you&apos;re looking for it / notice the security guard outside. A gem! 

Atmosphere: The security guard walks you downstairs, and you walk into a (really) dimly lit area, all lit by candles. It&apos;s a bit tough to read the menu (and sometimes you accidentally blow out the candles). Absolutely recommend for a romantic date night, or hanging out with a small group of friends over cocktails. There might be room for maybe 20-25 people in total.

Drinks: They have cocktails from the past decade recorded, so even if they&apos;re not listed on the seasonal menu, you can ask for a cocktail you had 10 years ago! That blows my mind! I had an incredible cocktail with passionfruit, gin, and tequila from a previous menu. The servers give great recommendations, and the cocktails are labeled within separate categories.

Overall: definitely 5/5. Drinks are on the pricier side, but worth it for the atmosphere and experience! I&apos;ll probably be back with my boyfriend, or to just have a nice night out with girl friends!"
3,"I was exhilarated to try the infamous cocktail lounge downstairs; instead it was perplexing and disappointing experience. 

I arrived simultaneously with another group of 4, we walked in towards the bar to seek the host, half way through a gentleman scolded us and walked THROUGH us towards the door. We followed as instructed and were told to wait outside next time if he was not there-- so my first interaction could have been improved by him 1) being at his post to greet, check ids, and escort us in or 2) greeting us inside with an actual salutation then asking for us to return to the door so he may check ids or 3) not scolding patrons with the aura of pretentiousness as it continued outside. Both groups were quite taken back and we laughed amongst ourselves trying to maintain a positive attitude

Upon being seated, I could barely hear my date as the music was so loud causing other guests to scream and waiters to look at you with a blank stare when you talked to them. If I have to yell at my waiter perhaps we can lower the volume?!  The lighting was perfect, visually it was understated Art Deco with cute small marble tables, wood plank ceiling, and a small bar to the back-- they nailed the aesthetics of a modern trendy speak easy... now if only the cocktails matched the ambience 

I ordered a dirty martini which I was told it is not something they make, shocking but not the end of the world. I then tried to pick something off the menu: an old fashioned. The drinks were crafted beautifully and instagram worthy, but I did not like my drink AT ALL, which is normally not a big deal but the staff response was beyond disheartening. 

Full disclosure I have been ordering this drink for years; far and in between the bartender misses the mark, no biggie. I explain what I&apos;m tasting and typically they remove it from the bill or modify the drink to my preferences. I explained my dissatisfaction to my waiter and described my preferred flavor profile; his response was &quot;well it&apos;s only two dashes of bitters&quot;, &quot;I can modify it or I will have to get a manager to remove it from the bill&quot;. I responded for them to either remake it or have the manager do so and I&apos;ll order another drink. While frustrated I know it&apos;s loud busy and he did not make the drink so I smiled and reexplained myself and sought my dates help who was sitting closer to him. The waiter then responds &quot;I can make it sweeter&quot; which demonstrates: 1) he didn&apos;t hear me because of the music 2) he was not listening 3) he is less knowledgeable and should go study or 4) presumptive that I needed the cocktail sweeter because I was a woman.   Amidst this extended interaction my date finally said &quot;just leave it I&apos;ll pay for it, would you please bring her a dry manhattan&quot;.  About three minutes later he returns asking my date, not me &quot;does she want vodka or gin&quot; when he corrected the order and inquired on top three bourbons he was unsure and walked away again. Upon his third return to the table I requested the check; it was not until we handed him the credit card and I removed myself from the table that he offered to get the manager... 

I would like to see management encourage their staff to say &quot;let me see what I can do&quot; or empower them to remove a cocktail if a guest is unhappy with and order another. At $20-30 a cocktail with a reputation, I would appreciate something delectable without the insecurities, ineptitude, and scoldings.  If you&apos;re going to impress a date or prefer ambiance, I recommend this place. If you&apos;re a spirits enthusiast I suggest skipping this one!"
5,"Absolutely loved it! The doorman was very welcoming and brought us down to our table, his mustache game was on point. Our waiter took the time to learn what kind of drinks we like in order to recommend a cocktail from the menu. The name of our drinks escape me (both from the refreshing part of the menu) and both were excellent. This would absolutely become a go-to place if I were a local."
3,"I really, really, really, hope that we showed up on a weird night.  I&apos;ve felt every time we&apos;ve been here in the past two years it&apos;s been worse and worse.  I thought it was bad when they ran out of all of the ingredients we wanted before, but last night was the worst.  

The doormen have always been amazing, but this time we were told there was a five or ten minute wait.  No problem, we&apos;ve never been able to just get a seat right away.  The doorman kind of made it seem like we shouldn&apos;t wait and go somewhere else though...   Two people left, he went down to clear our table and then from the steps below called up to us.  We were talking to another woman who asked us a question and I didn&apos;t realize the doorman was calling to us.  Weird...  The doorman always comes back up the steps to escort us down.  Was this guy just lazy? 

We were seated and I never remember music in this place.  I&apos;ve seen speakers before, but was music every playing?  I don&apos;t remember, but this nightclub was loud.  Is it still a speakeasy?  Our Waiter? came up, brought us water, took our drink order and brought us our cocktails.  They were good.  Thankfully!  For the next round, another waiter, who has been there the last few times we were there, brought us a drink menu and disappeared.  We waited for twelve minutes for someone else to come to us.  I looked around and a lot of the staff were dancing.  Even the doorman.  I guess he wasn&apos;t lazy, just tired from dancing.  Our waiter? came back to fill the water and I told him we wanted another round.  He said something like &quot;Someone will be over to take your order&quot;.  What?  Really?  If I didn&apos;t just use all of my cash up for dinner, I would have just dropped money and left.  Some woman came up, took our order and I gave her the credit card too to cash out.  So we wouldn&apos;t be waiting forever to leave.  Who brings us our drink?  The same Waiter? who took our orders and delivers them...   The same guy taking other peoples orders?  Why did he suddenly stop helping us?  First time in awhile there were no cocktail issues, other than not getting served, but everything else fell apart even more...  Still packed, but almost everyone coming in after us stayed for one drink and left.  Is that what they want now?  For people to wait in line, then be forced to get a drink since they waited so long, but then leave after one drink due to the music and service?"
4,"Super cool speakeasy vibe and very much hidden. If you&apos;re not looking for it you won&apos;t find it :)

...but if you are looking for it, there are a few people outside checking IDs so it&apos;s not impossible to find like some other places I&apos;ve been to.

The place itself is fairly small and dark, the menu has a good selection as well, but if you don&apos;t see something you like the bartender can make almost anything, just ask! We went with a friend of mine who had been before and wanted a drink that&apos;s no longer on the menu. We were able to order it anyway and I&apos;m so glad we did because it was delicious!

The price is on par with other similar places so that didn&apos;t bother me, but it does need some general TLC. The booths are ripped and leaking stuffing which made it a little awkward to sit comfortably. Also the music they played was very loud and reminded me of more of a dance club than a bar. Since the space is so small it was difficult to talk so we only ended up staying for one drink; we really just wanted to catch up and it wasn&apos;t happening with that kind of volume.

Overall, I would definitely come back for a curated cocktail, the bartender knows what he&apos;s doing and it shows."
3,"This was a very interesting place... Probably one of the most interesting places that I went to in Philadelphia. A group of work colleagues text me and told me to meet them at this place. I show up and it looks like just a blank, plane building. I text my friends again and they say &quot;talk to the guy out front in the Eddie Bauer vest. Ask him about where he is from (Harrisburg) and tell him you are here to meet our group.&quot; So I do that, the guy goes inside, then comes back out five minutes later and approves me to go inside. The production was because this is a speakeasy and I am assuming to keep with tradition, you have to go through some kind of song and dance like that!

Anyways, I got inside and could hardly see because it was so dark. The drink menu has no prices, all of the drinks are hard to pronounce and have alcohol in them I have never even heard of, and the server was less than vague when I would ask questions about each drink. So I close my eyes. With my finger and pick whatever one it touched. I don&apos;t even remember what the thing was... all I remember is that it was STRONG! I can check speakeasy off my bucket list, but this place was definitely not my vibe. It was nice and everyone else seem to enjoy it."
4,Came here for drinks on a Friday night. Surprisingly wasn&apos;t difficult to get in. Inside there were booths that seat four. Was a little chilly near the door. Their cocktail menu was pretty extensive. Sadly the waiters weren&apos;t that knowledgeable about the menu.the cocktails are priced at $15 and $22. At this price you usually expect highest level of knowledge about the drinks but meh. The cocktails were pretty tasty overall. Not sure I&apos;d come back since at that price you expect a lot.
5,"True art lies in making strong and flavorful drinks. The search for great mixology and the mystery of a speakeasy allured us to this spot. With a 5-7 min wait, we were walked to our table. Like any good speakeasy, this place was small and quaint, it has multiple tables and a mini bar at one end. We were given water and menus. They have interesting drink categories and we were confused so we asked and we given some excellent suggestions! 
The drinks themselves were excellent and the vibe was great! Definitely one of the better speakeasies in Philadelphia!"
4,"I&apos;ll preface this by saying this was not my initial destination, we had another speakeasy in the city in mind. Unfortunately,  Hop Sing was closed on Wednesday, This was the backup plan. Not easy to fill in for a desired destination.  All that being said, this was a solid speakeasy visit that one of our local friends frequesnts regularly. 

The server was knowledgeable and attentive. He crafted drinks based on our preferences that were delicious - several were mescal fans. It was dark and loud with semi-private seating areas. We were a rather large group so being able to sit intimately and converse was just what we were looking for."
3,"Was bummed that they just transitioned the upstairs bar from the tiki bar! Came here for that, but didn&apos;t feel like mezcal so went downstairs. Was pricey, but the drinks were strong and creative. The space itself was dark and felt damp like a cave. The server wasn&apos;t very friendly either and the music was pretty loud for the vibe they were going for. I love Speakeasy type spots, but wouldn&apos;t recommend this to anyone."
5,Came here to experience some hand crafted drinks and check out one of the gems in philly! Beware: theres no food here but it&apos;s a very chill spot for an intimate setting to enjoy the company of a special person. All the drinks are made to order and super fresh! I&apos;d definitely come here again!
3,"I found this place on Timeout, liked what I read, and a quick glance of yelp indicated people liked this place. So off my friend and I went.

TBH, I was going to give this place two stars before reading the reviews. Note to management: You may wish to reach out to the major review sites (e.g., Timeout, et. al.,) and ask them to be clear that the &quot;let me check&quot; thing is part of the shtick. The thing is, my SO and I are a mixed race couple, and in this day and age, there&apos;s always the potential for service issues to be chalked up to well, you know... My SO and I arrived late on a Saturday night, and the place was literally half empty. So the &quot;let me check&quot; thing came across in the wrong way -- the first thought is, &quot;oh, they&apos;re packed and they need to see if there&apos;s room&quot;. And then you walk in and half the tables are free. One&apos;s first thought is, &quot;WTF, of course he knew the place was empty,  what the heck did he have to &apos;check&apos; for?&quot; So anyway, it&apos;s really offputting if one isn&apos;t in on it.

That aside... I usually give four stars to things where everything is great/I generally liked the experience, except for the price. But... the music just doesn&apos;t make sense. I have no idea what a real speakeasy is like, but the music is too loud and too &quot;thump thump thump&quot; to have a relaxing conversation with a date. It made it hard to stay, relax, chill, sip, and talk. It was more hip-hop/dance type of stuff. 

While I liked my drink, my SO wasn&apos;t a fan of hers, at least not at that price. We stuck to the $15 cocktails (which is a reasonable price for a craft cocktail in a big city bar) but they have stuff over $22 that makes you go WTF. And at those prices, I just want to sit and chill."
5,"Amazing ambiance and incredible drinks! My friends and I came here on a Thursday night around 8pm for some post-dinner drinks to celebrate my birthday. 

The &quot;bouncer&quot; was dressed in 1920s clothing and led us downstairs to the bar right away. The mood was super cozy with excellent lighting and decor. I ordered the Miss Behave (cognac, Smith &amp; Cross, coffee liqueur, Amaro Abano, Averna, and cacao). It was absolutely delicious! I tried my friends&apos; drinks and they were also incredible. 

I definitely plan to come back here for an excellent cocktail and snug atmosphere!"
