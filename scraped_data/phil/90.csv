5,"Stayed in center city for the night and was looking for somewhere i haven&apos;t been before.  I was in the mood for Latin food and the menu here seemed interesting enough so I thought I&apos;d give it a shot.

I haven&apos;t had a delicious hearty meal like this in a long time.  The portions were also huge.  Given the prices on the menu I thought it would be one of those cases where I&apos;d be making a late night wawa run after getting hungry again, but we had enough leftovers for 2 more meals.

We got the chicken empanadas, Maduro relleno, Ropa Vieja, and rice with shrimp.

The Maduro relleno is something I will order without hesitation each time I go in the future.  This giant plantain is sweet and caramelized on the outside and stuffed with delicious beef and cheese on the inside.  This is almost a meal in itself and would be the one thing I&apos;d recommend to everyone.

The empanadas were perfectly cooked and the filling was moist and flavorful.  The salsa served with it was fresh and spicy which was a nice contrast to the meatiness of the empanada.

The Ropa Vieja is the ultimate hearty meal for anyone who likes stews.  The meat truly does fall apart and you don&apos;t even need the rice.  The vegetables and seasoning are on point and the whole dish is just the ultimate definition of comfort food.

The shrimp with rice sounds simple, but the flavors were anything but.  This dish is made with saphron rice, shrimp, olives, and smoked sausage.  The olives and sausage bring a saltiness and smokiness to the dish where you don&apos;t need to add any kind of additional seasoning.  I would definately get this again.  

I definiately want to go back and eat indoors once things settle down a bit more with covid because even though the food was delicious, I would love to see the dishes plated in their natural habitat."
5,"Consistently Delicious
I&apos;ve had several meals here over the last 6 years and it&apos;s consistently good.  Love the food and margaritas and guacamole!  Friendly service too!  The outdoor Covid19 seating seems lively and busy.  In fact, each time I walk by at dinner-time, there are guests sitting in this area.

I recently placed a take-out order (first time) and it was delicious!   I ordered &quot;rice &amp; shrimp&quot; with side of red beans and avocado.  YUMMY.  The hubby order a ribeye dish with shrimp and was very happy with his choice.  He claims he isn&apos;t a fan of this type of cuisine, but I cannot vouch for that since he gobbled down his dinner with gusto!  In fact, he always comes away from this restaurant with a smile.  lol

I hope we return soon to try more of this delicious Cuban fare."
5,"This place is *chef&apos;s kiss* no lie. I came here for restaurant week and had the best brunch for takeout!

I started off with the freshest guacamole and plantain chips that were made with the perfect crispiness. I also got to try some of the king crab empanadas, which were also juicy and flavorful.

I ordered the Argentinian breakfast, which had steak, two eggs, potatoes, and a side salad. Everything was cooked to how I liked it. The only thing was the potatoes were extra salty and the steak was on the bland side. But I guessed it worked out when you combine them for each bite. Mixto also have a whole bag of bread. I don&apos;t know what it was, but it was delicious.

My favorite was the dessert. If you know me, you know I&apos;m obsessed with tres leches. So, I got a slice and ate it all even though I was already busting out the seams. The cake was not overly sweet, which was good because they would put the tres leches liquid mixture in a separate cup to pour over on your own. Definitely loved the experience for only $20!!"
5,Amazing place to have a date in the Gayborhood. Their food was really tasty and my waiter had to layers of protection a mask and face shield
5,"This Latin restaurant bar was lovely. Good service, good food and good drinks. They have happy hour on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Sundays. $6 margaritas, mojitos and sangrias. Some food appetizers as well. The chicken empanadas were my favorite"
4,"We had a pleasant experience at Mixto during a recent Philadelphia restaurant week. The food portions were plentiful and tasty, the service was pleasant and efficient, the menu prices are very reasonable and the ambiance was inviting.  We also received 10% off with a Yelp check-in. 

The restaurant week menu offered 3-courses (appetizer/salad, entree, and dessert). The courses were standard size portions and not some scaled down restaurant week offerings. 

It seemed like a  lot of food, which it was and that&apos;s why we only went with one set of options from the restaurant week menu. We ordered the  Ensalada Islena de Aguacate y Mango, Salmon a la Parrilla, and the Quattro Leche from the Restaurant week menu and a second entree the Arroz con Camarones.  Everything was delicious and we both had leftovers to take home."
4,"This is a great brunch spot! My wife and I usually come here as a safe option because we know what we are getting... Great Food! 

This time around my wife got the Costa Rican breakfast and I got the American breakfast. With our meat options, we both chose the vegan chorizo. The vegan chorizo is why I&apos;ll keep coming back here.. it is delicious! I can have a plate of just this! The rest of the food was very good. My wife asked to sub the plantains for yuca, the waitress must&apos;ve forgot. But the manager was so kind, he brought the fried yuca out afterwards without hesitation. Francisco, who was extremely friendly and kind, is one of the reasons we will both be back ASAP! He took time out to talk to us, make sure everything was great, and checked on us frequently.. without even being our server! 

Also, ask for the bread basket with the hot salsa, this is a MUST HAVE! 

Why 4, instead of 5.. the manager himself gets a 10 out of 5 but unfortunately our server didn&apos;t come around as much and really didn&apos;t seem attentive to our table. If it wasn&apos;t for Francisco this might be 3 stars. 

Book a brunch reservation and come here, food and drinks are great! This place is a safe option."
4,"I have to say, I have been to Mixto maybe 5 or 6 times and I have yet to be disappointed. I went with my s/o during covid and the quality hasn&apos;t been compromised whatsoever. Heads up, they are not taking reservations or call aheads, however they were about 3 of their 9 sidewalk tables available on a Saturday at 6pm which is great. It did begin to develop a line as we were leaving, but nothing crazy.

OK OK, let me get onto the good stuff already. I have never had a 
margarita there, that I did not enjoy. They always have a great balance of fruit selection and tequila aftertastes which really warms my soul. The parcha or passionfruit margarita hit the bar as always. If your not a sweet person, their mojitos are tasty as well. We started with chicken empanadas which are served with a light sauce with a hint a spice. Empanadas have great flavor and a perfect fry to them, sauce was paired well. Typically when I go, I always indulge in the octopus salad which is served with roasted fingerlings and chimichurri (I&apos;ll add those pictures as well). However, of all my visits I must say the chicharrones may be my fave appetizer yet. The appetizer sampler, plato mix, is def the best value. 
So for the entree, this time I did branch out from my standard scallop dish and lamp chop rotation I have going pretty strong here (I&apos;ll add those pictures too). I wanted to try something different. My s/o ordered ropas vieja, which is pretty much like a cuban beef stew. The flavor was spot on and the beef was tender and cooked well. It did get a bit salty as you got more into the dish, but none overpowering or inedible. I ordered the tropical sea bass which comes with sweet mashed potatoes (which I believe is more of an adjective, because the only things sweet about them was the awesome piping job), avocado avocado aioli (which was more like guac), pineapple pico de Gallo and sautéed spinach and mushrooms. 
If you&apos;re ever able to come here for dessert I HIGHLY recommend the warm bananas empanadas, it is the perfect finale. They were out of those and I drank my calories instead with an espresso martini. 
All in all if your looking for tasting latin food that with def worth the value, then I highly recommend."
2,"We went here awhile ago, but service really sucked. There were a bunch of mistakes made with our drink orders and the person taking them was really rude despite the fact it was their own fault. They also tried to charge us for the messed up drinks until we called them out for it. Definitely double check your receipts."
5,"Wow! What a fun night! We went here for my friends birthday dinner so we had a party of 14 people. The waitress and waiters were very friendly and accommodating. We were served complementary bread in the beginning which basically tasted like Texas toast. It wasn&apos;t anything special but it was good with our meals. 

I ordered the ropa vieja. I usually don&apos;t order much beef but I&apos;m very glad I ordered this. The meat was tender, delicious, and very flavorful. I paired this with yellow rice and black beans. The maduros (plantains) were incredibly soft and perfect. It seemed like everyone enjoyed their meals overall. 

We were able to bring a birthday cake and they happily served it to us at the end. The staff was nice enough to sing happy birthday to my friend. It was a lot of fun!"
5,"Love Mixto! It is a cute, romantic spot located v centralized in the Gayborhood. The aesthetic is very cute, but it is a small spot and it does get crazy on the weekends. If you are coming during the week for dinner, you&apos;ll be fine to get a table or seat at the bar. They also have a couple outdoor tables if the weather is nice.

The drinks are amazing!!! They have margs and mojitos and corona-ritas. Recommend them all and I have also had them all LOL. They do pitchers as well, we love that for us.

Food is on point. The most recent time I was here we got a bunch of tapas and split them. Obviously the empanadas are a MUST, the bruschetta over plantains as well were very good - but a small portion.  The guac is also delish and they have a sampler platter as well that we tried, I probably wouldn&apos;t get this again, I didn&apos;t like the ceviche or the dough-type appetizer. 

I highly recommend this spot for a date night, girls night, any night! So good. Can&apos;t wait to come back."
5,"The food and service is exceptional, I&apos;ve had food from here at all times of the the day at different points of the week and everyday is as good, if not better than the last. Food is great at all times of the day, my favorite is their brunch. If you&apos;re not afraid of good food at a reasonable price than try this out, you&apos;ll thank me later."
5,"Mixto is an awesome, and I highly recommend it. Can not talk highly enough about Mixto. I have to admit, Cuban Breakfast was really great. I think that I could perhaps have a new favorite dish now. Staff had amazing service, very welcoming and accommodating. Overall, I &apos;d go back in a heartbeat."
4,"It&apos;s a Saturday night and my first time dining here, the occasion being a birthday dinner for a friend of mine. We had a party of 15 so we were seated at a long group of tables upstairs. Our server was Lilliana and she did an amazing job balancing it all. We started off with a couple cocktails, namely their spicy mango margarita. Plenty of kick and just the right balance of sweet and spice. My second drink had no fruit garnish which was a little disappointing given that was how I was getting the extra spices around the rim into the drink itself. Nevertheless I sipped away while dancing in my seat to the lively salsa playing in the background. 

The time comes to order and I ended up going with the Arroz con Camarones which came with a few maduros on top and a side of black beans. Overall it was just okay. It needed some salt and something else on the side like avocado or some kind of citrus slaw. All in all, I&apos;d recommend this place and hope to be back soon."
3,"My fiancé and I dined here with one other couple on a warm Sunday evening. Our friends wanted to bring their pup along and since Mixto has a few outdoor tables, this place was perfect. It was crowded right when we got there, but luckily, our friend had made a reservation so we were given the first open table outside (which was just minutes after we arrived). 

Our waiter was very prompt and took our drink and food orders quickly. I decided to go for a large passion fruit mojito while others at the table got a guava mojito, mango margarita and a beer. When we were served our drinks though, our waiter couldn&apos;t tell the passion fruit and guava apart because of how similar they are in color so we ended up just grabbing whichever one we thought might be the flavor we asked for. Honestly, I still have no idea which one I actually ended up drinking, but either way, it was underwhelming. 

After having had a late lunch, I wasn&apos;t too hungry and decided to share an entree with my fiancé. He chose the Churrasco Argentino and I tried bites of all that came in the dish which included the skirt steak, rice and veggies. I&apos;m not a huge fan of red meat but I still thought the steak was good. The rice and veggies are what I was most excited for and they were just okay. They both tasted rather bland. Along with the entree, we ordered Madura Relleno - an appetizer with sweet plantain, Cuban beef and mozzarella. I thought this was far better than our entree. If I were to return to Mixto, I would have no problem getting it again. 

All in all, I wouldn&apos;t be dragged kicking and screaming into Mixto but it definitely wouldn&apos;t be my first choice. If I am to return, I&apos;d try to go from 5-7pm on a week night so I can take advantage of their happy hour deals instead of making it my entire lunch or dinner."
3,"I&apos;m not sure why Mixto is marked as a Caribbean restaurant. On a trip here with some friends for lunch, I saw precisely 0 classic Caribbean dishes on their menu! Don&apos;t expect Jerk chicken and the likes here (atleast not during lunch).

That being said, we had a reasonably good meal. We shared a few plates of Empanadas - I thought the chicken ones were very good. These ones had shredded chicken in them which absorbed the flavors quite well. This came along with some salsa which had just enough kick to be tasty without being overwhelming.

I got the Pollo Cubano with Chicken for my mains. Reasonable portion size, and I felt that the seasoning on the rice was good! So to were the plantains which came on the side. For context, I&apos;m not a fan of sweet hot dishes (unless its dessert!) and I still thought these were really good, as they cut across the savoriness of the rice very well.

The rice itself seemed to be cooked in a tomato base to a semi dry way. Tasty overall, but the chicken in the rice was a big let down - particularly after the good empanadas. The chicken seemed to have been cooked separately and taste wise seemed like an after thought. The sausage bits in the rice were slightly better, but again - seemed to not have absorbed much of the taste of the flavorful rice base.

I&apos;d ideally give Mixto a 3.5/5. I should add their Dinner menu looked larger so that could be the way to go! Lunch does have Mimosas though..."
5,"I have attempted several times to order mufungo....bravely I cross my fingers and each time I have been sadly met with disappointment  until NOW........

I&apos;m saying you HAVE TO GET THE MUFUNGO!!! Soooooooo moist and the stew-like sauce is thinner than gravy and isnt over-flavored! Perfection in my opinion! I&apos;m ordering mlre tomorrow to take back home with me."
5,"Such a great restaurant! Both brunch &amp; dinner are fantastic. They also have a good restaurant week menu and special events like Valentines Day. You can sit at the bar and do the full menu as well or just have drinks. I recently just went for drinks at the bar. I enjoyed two skinny margaritas. They have something for everyone: tons of flavors of margaritas, sangria, caprihinas, wine, beer, everything. The margaritas are big too and served in fun glasses. Mixto has a great staff, very attentive and friendly. I would recommend reservations if you are sitting down to eat because it does get busy!"
5,Always excellent dining experience when we eat here. The food and service are great. They are usually packed on the weekend but we lucked up because of the holiday and got a last minute reservation.  I ordered the sea bass and my wife had the scallops.  Both were excellent along with the sautéed shrimp we started with.  Make sure you order the Maduro Relleno.
4,"We actually came for happy hour and mentioned that as we walked in, but we weren&apos;t told that until we were seated that happy hour was only at the bar, one level above. By then, we were firmly ensconced in our window side seats, so we decided to just stay put.

We decided to go for the &quot;Plato Mixto&quot;, a hefty $26 sampler that came with two each of the following:  Arepas, empanadas, chicharrones, chorizo, shrimp ceviche, tostones, maduros, papa rellena. 

I loved the shrimp ceviche - I could have and would have slurped up every bit of that golden spicy deliciousness.  The chicarrones (fried pork belly) was also quite the delicacy, and nicely meaty without too much fat. Everything else was also quite good. For those with a less fiery taste in spice, note that the salsa and one of the &quot;blanca&quot; / white toppings (on maybe the tostone?) was pretty hot.  Water, water, water!  Gimme a big old glass of water!  I loved it.

Hostess kindly held luggage for my friends while we dined."
