5,Always an A+ experience. Perfect atmosphere and service - consistently. Ask for window seating if available. Hotel valet parking makes the entire dining experience even better!
5,"Lacroix, without a doubt is definitely Michelin contender of the year. 

Must get: tasting menu, mocktails, Dan as your waiter
Missed out: wine pairing
Meh: nothing

We celebrated our anniversary here and immediately felt as if we were transported to another world of culinary and service excellence. The staff were highly attentive (the one&apos;s who&apos;ll fold your napkin if you leave your table for longer than 10 seconds), the decor was beautiful with large windows that overlooked the rittenhouse square. On arrival, we were treated to complimentary glasses of champagne, and multiple rounds of flavorful mid-meal snacks. Our main meal was white asparagus, halibut, rabbit, beef, with a multi-course dessert tasting including frozen coconut, marshmallow on a stick, and decorative cake, and truffle tasting and chocolate desserts to go. My favorite dish was definitely the wild rabbit with fava bean, sauce royale and the smoked sturgeon with chavings of white asparagus. Still have mouth watering memories.

At the end, we ate and were treated like kings and queens. This was a meal that I will never forget in Philadelphia.

5,"I enjoyed my birthday brunch experience here so much. I was a little hesitant to dine at a restaurant inside a hotel initially, but I was so glad to get one of my birthday meals here. For $75 per person, you get a brunch buffet with some of the top-quality food, top-notch service and very elegant environment. Everything was impeccable. 

After coat check, a staff member showed us to the beautiful table right next to the large windows, where you can overlook the Rittenhouse Park. As first timers, we were shown around by the restaurant manager and introduced to different stations all over the restaurant. Some of the stations were located inside the kitchen and you&apos;re able to see everything that happens there. 

The food selection was amazing. You have your regular breakfast/brunch items, and you also have a variety of very specialized appetizers, entrée and desserts, even cheese and chocolate fondues. I particularly enjoyed the raw bar where we could get unlimited east coast and west coast oysters (east coast ones tasted better!). They tried to combine different styles of cuisines in their dishes, like a Vietnamese pho broth shooter, or a French Foie Gras S&apos;more, etc. Each tiny dessert was a pleasant surprise too and they were so delicate. I did not have enough room to try out everything that looked tempting. 

To add on to all the good food, our server was so attentive that he made us a personalized list of all the food that contains cilantro, as we added a note about our dietary restriction on the reservation. 

I would love to go back again for brunch, and I would love to try the afternoon tea here too!"
5,"A high end and fancy place that caters to the finest of consumers. The lacroix restaurant presents itself very nicely and is definitely one of the fancier places here in Philly.

I have dined here a few times and would have to say, it is one of the more unique experiences. The food is delicious and the staff are one of the best. 

The first time I came here was on easter morning for a nice bunch with my grandparents and girlfriend. We were blown away by the presentation and staff right off the bat. The wait staff tended to our every need and gave us a tour of the food presentation areas. 

This is an all you can eat brunch, so there were many foods beautifully presented, along with nice decorations. Each station is very easy to access and use. 

The more unique part of this dining experience was the entry and food located in the kitchen area. While cooks are making the food, you can walk around and take food off of the stations. There are also manned stations  in which you can ask for specific things such as a cut of meat or a freshly made ice cream made with liquid nitrogen. 

Each station is clearly laid out and the waiters will assist in giving you a tour and helping choose tasty foods. Many of the foods here are fancier such as the caviar and the tasty s&apos;mores foie gras. 

For specific stations, there is a meat station, where you can get tasty, freshly cut in front of you, steaks and things such as Wagyu. There is a dessert station, which hosts a plethora of tasty desserts, a chocolate fountain, and a person that makes ice cream for you. (Also in front of you) There is a breakfast station, that has many of the basic breakfast foods: eggs, potatoes, bacon, etc.  there is also a raw bar with many oysters, shrimp, and other delicious options. There are many more stations as well. 

The dress code here is more upscale and nicer, so you should try to wear something a little nicer. I have seen individuals wear jeans and a tee shirt, bu t this sort of makes the place awkward since everyone else is dressed up. 

For drinks, there is a full bar with many options. You can order whatever you want, and it will come back perfect. They try to make it a really great experience, so your happiness is taken into account. 

I would also like to address the more classy, spoiled, and rich people. My first encounter with a waiter involved many sirs and pardons, so if you are a fancy snob, you will be treated as a king/queen. At the time, I found this funny because of the fact that I am very used to talking to waiters and waitresses casually. This waiter made me feel special. Very cool!

The amount of tasty food you can eat is massive, and you will be amazed at how full you can get. If you want to have a great experience, I would say try everything and if you are still hungry, take the things you enjoyed the most. 

The bathrooms are also very nice and upscale. I was surprised to find complimentary bottles of mouth wash in the men&apos;s room and complimentary sewing kits and other things in the women&apos;s (found by girlfriend) 

Getting reservations for here is a little tricky, as it is usually booked and very upscale. A person needs to pull some  strings to get here, but it is well worth it. 

Overall, this place was very unique and impressive. I recommend going here, and if you want to be even more impressed, go during a holiday/ special occasions. A really great place to go and even better food pics!

Views are awesome too so get a window seat!"
4,"This is truly a hidden gem. I brunched with Lacroix yesterday and the experience I had was unforgettable. Joshua, our server was really helpful and explained how brunch was served at Lacriox. He made sure to let us know that the good food is back IN the kitchen. 

Yes, hidden inside the kitchen. Don&apos;t hesitate to go in the kitchen because I was hesitate at first and I had to ask Josh to make sure if I was allowed to go in. Lol. It was a another world there and I loved how the food was displayed in the back kitchen, especially the desserts. There was a variety of foods from your basic American bacon and eggs breakfast to West coast and East coast oysters and foie gras s&apos;mores! Not to mention they have a cheese and meat layout in the back! 

Some tip!
Make sure to check in on yelp to get complimentary champagne. And if you plan to brunch here, make sure to come with an empty stomach and dine for 1.5-2 hours to get your moneys worth! We definitely made it worth it. 

I would give this place a solid 4.5 stars. Service and food was great. Price is a bit high. Definitely a great treat once in a blue moon though!"
4,"Lacroix. Just the name of the restaurant is so inviting. First, I must say we love Terry, our server here!

My friend took me here to make up for the bad lunch we had another day prior, and I was super excited! 

We made reservations and when we arrived, we were immediately greeted with a host who checked in our bags and introduced us to terry, our amazing server (he did not let our water glass go beyond the half point before he hopped up to refill it!) 

Food- we both got the soup of the day, and I was happy it was a seafood soup! To me it was more similar to a chowder because it wasn&apos;t seafoody (fishy) or anything. It was a great chowder and packed with seafood! Every bite you get a full sized piece of oyster or mussel and all kinds of seafood. It was a 3.5/5. 

Scallops-*drools* cooked to perfection! Nice big scallops that were seasoned and cooked beautifully. 

Polenta cake- the polenta cake was very good, just a bit too much. It was cooked perfectly and had the slightest taste of sweetness that tied the entire dish together. 

Drinks- we had a glass of white and a red and Terry made sure we tasted and liked our wine before he continued to fill our glasses with delicious wine! 

I love it here. 4.5/5"
5,"Magical experience with the best food my wife and I have had in a long time. Highly recommend the 6 course meal!

Prepare to be whisked away to food paradise. They will treat you like Kings and Queens."
5,"Came here for Brunch today! My brother and I were super excited to give this place a try. 

When you enter the restaurant, the buffet is literally everywhere. It&apos;s throughout the dining room and even into the kitchen! Our server was incredibly helpful by giving us a tour beforehand. She asked if anyone had any dietary restrictions and I told her I was vegan. She quickly got a menu for me with all of the vegan options highlighted. There were only three dishes highlighted but she told me the chef could prepare me custom vegan courses. I quickly agreed to that. My brother joined in on the courses as well. 

She first brought us a salad course with 4 different salads. We loved the Brussel sprout quinoa tahini salad. We were then served a couple canapés to snack on. Then she brought a warm course of pasta, assorted vegetables and sweet potato samosas with cranberry chutney. We were getting so full! And she even brought us a dessert course! It had small pieces of carrot cake, chocolate cake, lemon cake and a coconut panna cotta ice cream. I was so happy and full!

We loved the delicious cocktails, especially the Bellini, along with the fresh orange juice and delicious hot teas! Thank you so much Lacroix for accommodating me and making my experience so special!"
5,"Phenomenal service, atmosphere and food. Our party of four got a booth facing the square, and it was snowing outside so the view was exquisite. Pre-fixe menu with a few options to upgrade and an optional caviar menu to start the night. Lots of little surprises in between the scheduled five courses (Scallops, Black bass, chicken, duck/beef, dessert).

Zero complaints from our table, which got two delicious wines based off of recommendations from the waiter. New silverware for every course and no glass was ever empty (water or wine). While we knew there were a lot of tables, we felt very private in our booth and enjoyed it! We want to try to wine pairing next time!"
5,"The Lacroix is located on the second level of The Rittenhouse Hotel. The service is fabulous and the food delicious. I stopped in for brunch which they offer buffet style or a la carte. The lemon ricotta pancakes were delicious and huge. The sausage came out as two large servings as well. 

Really can&apos;t say enough about the staff, service, and venue. Highly recommend it even if you&apos;re not a guest at the hotel."
5,"I am not generally a fan of so-called fancy brunches--I feel no need to help clear-out some restaurant&apos;s leftovers amidst a roomful of hungover strangers when I can cook my own damn eggs in peace and quiet; nor oft do I partaketh in the hair of the dog.
This is different. 
This  here, this, is THE consummate Easter egg hunt for adults.
Here, one wanders wide-eyed thru a shimmering dream-field of inox, toque and open flame  Your neurons and olfactors, both reptilian and civilized, shall prickle with anticipatory dopamine as your visual cortex overclocks on the sheer magnitude of food so deeply detailed.
For here, in this open kitchen, the magic really is real.  

If you don&apos;t have a reservation, they&apos;ll fit you in but you won&apos;t get a window.
If you wipe out that grey/black pile of caviar with a teaspoon you will not be shamed. 
If you head to the elevator with a baguette sticking out of purse or pocket they will pretend not to notice."
5,"SERVICE

I LOVED their excellent service. It really enhanced the experience.

ENVIRONMENT

I considered it excellent. Not noisy at all. You can have a conversation without yelling and without struggling to hear. I like that a lot.

Window seats have nice views of Rittenhouse Square Park.

Located inside the elegant Rittenhouse Hotel.

Really enjoyed my time here. Not cheap. (For example: If you want a steak sandwich, it will cost you $24.)"
5,"I just celebrated my birthday here and had a wonderful time!  We had the plated 7-course tasting dinner but we had some extras courtesy of the chef since it was my birthday. I also remembered to check in at Yelp so we got two free glasses of champagne.  The waiting staff, the chef and the host were all very polite, nice, and attentive.  The plating, explanation, and the food itself were all very delicious.  The ambience was very nice.  We got cocktails on top of the champagne which was about $16 each.  The 7 course tasting menu was $125/person which is pricey but worth it because of the very unique experience.  We will be back again and maybe try their lunch/brunch menu some other time."
5,"Atmosphere opulence. Service impeccable. Food delectable. Overall decadence.

I don&apos;t even know where to begin, literally. I didn&apos;t realize it was inside the Rittenhouse Hotel, and then a series of twists and turns to find the actual restaurant. At least the lobby area and hallways are pure eye candy so it&apos;s nice getting lost. We came for the brunch buffet which is $75/person but it is well worth it. The service is what you would expect at such an upscale place. I also love the view of RIttenhouse Park with the entire wall of windows. We were a bit hesitant to bring our screaming toddler with us, but there seemed to be alot of families there with kids running around. This is a strange thing to note, but I was also very impressed by the high chair they provided us. 

The food is incredible. We skipped the food found in the seating area which consisted of standard breakfast items and a raw bar. Without giving away the surprise, we were whisked away to the main entrees. There are lots of fancy items between the appetizers, entrees, and desserts. My favorite appetizers are the Pho Broth Shooters with Quail Eggs and Shrimp Cakes. I tried all the carved meats, and my favorite is the giant scallop sausage."
2,"Ate dinner here a few years ago and was blown away by the quality, selection, and creativity.  Was given choices for each course and loved everything I got.

Attempted to do dinner here more recently.  Stodgy, dated, limited menu with animal cruelty dishes in almost every advertised course (e.g., veal, foie gras).  No answer to my phone calls to see if alternatives available.  Broken promises to call back when I contacted them on FB Messenger."
5,"April 9, 2017

Celebrating our wedding anniversary with the hubby for brunch at Lacroix restaurant. Hands down the brunch here is consistent, with a multitude of food options for all palates. Our view was spectacular as we  overlooked Rittenhouse Square park. A beautiful, sunny yet cool spring day but no snow, unlike a year prior.

I noted a few menu changes from the last time we I was here with friends and they changed things up behind the scenes in the kitchen with the food stations. The desserts have a room all to themselves. Vegans, vegetarians, carnivores and all the food lovers in-between can find things to enjoy to include but not limited to, sushi, caviar, shrimp, pancakes, breads/sweet breads, lamb, scallops, prime beef, various breakfast meats, cheeses and specialty food fusions from land to sea prepared for the most discerning tats to those who will try anything.

No long review needed here because the food, beverages, ambiance and staff are exemplary. The wait staff work harmoniously with each other so there is always someone around that is attentive and catering to each guests&apos; needs/wants, which is is refreshing and sets the bar for premium customer service."
3,"I came here with my mom and two family friends for Sunday brunch at 1:30 pm. The dining area is super clean and my table had a great view of Rittenhouse Park. The staff were incredible and made the dining experience very pleasant. They were super friendly, welcoming, knowledgeable about the food, answered any questions I had, were prompt in filling up water glasses, and folding our dining clothes. The manager (I think), who was super nice, gave us a tour of where all the food was in the dining area and in the kitchen.

There are a lot of buffet options, however, none of the food blew me away. Of all the plates I got, I only loved four dishes-- Pork Shoulder with Koji Glaze; Szechuan Spiced Niman Ranch Brisket with Broccoli and Ginger Relish; Grilled Rhode Island Squid, Mussels, Sundried Tomato, Saffron, Radish Salad; and Foie Gras S&apos;mores. 

It&apos;s a nice restaurant to dine at once but the food is not worth coming back for especially because the brunch here is not cheap."
5,"What can be said that hasn&apos;t already been covered about Lacroix!? This place is THE spot to have a gorgeous, get gussied up brunch. We scored a reservation for the famously fancy brunch buffet during a recent visit to Philly. My husband put on a handsome suit, I donned a little black dress and away we went for a fabulous experience! 

Upon arrival, the hostess took my jacket and our umbrellas (thanks for the rain, Philly!). We had a delightful and perfectly romantic window table overlooking Rittenhouse Square. It was beyond dreamy. A woman with a penchant for exceptional coffee service took our order for a caffeinated beverage. I went with a cappuccino, and  it was delicious. Then, our server came by, introduced herself and gave us a mouth-watering tour of the bounties that awaited us. In the front hallway, oysters, caviar, smoked salmon, smoked trout, sushi and all the trimmings. Nearby, a table full of delightful cold appetizers: think picnic bread with olives, romaine with avocado dressing, seafood salad and foie gras s&apos;mores!

Throughout the dining area we&apos;re traditional brunch offerings and pastries. The real treats awaited back in the working kitchen. Yep, you get to go back to where the magic happens for hot appetizers like pho broth shooters with a poached quail egg, grilled eggplant and mini ham biscuits. Around the bend were meats like a pork shoulder, leg of lamb and scallop sausage! Side dishes like pasta with corn and maitakes, clams with pork belly, pastilla and sauteed mushrooms. A charcuterie display to beat all others sat along one wall, begging me to have a nibble of prosciutto or a bite of salami.

Feeling full? Remember, it&apos;s a marathon not a sprint. So pace yourself. Because they saved the best for last: DESSERT IN THE WALK-IN! Venture in to the chilly room for a bounty of sweet treats, including house made on-the-spot dippin&apos; dots and a chocolate fountain! 

But wait, there&apos;s more! Are you thirsty? Yes,you are. So you need fresh squeezed juice, a champagne cocktail and/or a bottle of vino to accompany the feast.

We had so much fun. The service was amazing. The meal was delicious. I only wish it hadnt been raining - we needed a walk after all that food !

Lacroix - worth it."
5,"Going to up this another star. The glut of fast casual, big salad bowl types places is really a great trend however one sometimes loses the elegance and mindfulness found in a carefully choreographed and plated meal. 

When one needs a respite from the hubbub, Lacroix is standout in its service, cuisine, and flavors. They pay special attention to all the elements of a meal from provenance of the ingredients, the flavors, textures, pacing, pairings, and visual appeal."
4,"I was in Philadelphia for a conference and we had a small group dinner here. The waitstaff were fantastic! From our happy hour, to appetizers, right through dessert they were attentive, on top of everything, remembering who had what drinks, who liked which appetizers, and they made excellent recommendations for the meal selections.  The only reason I didn&apos;t give a 5 star rating was the lobster bisque and the lava cake. 

The bisque was served room temperature, there was no actual lobster in it, and the flavor was....meh. The lava cake is very small making it a challenge to actually have &quot;lava&quot; in the center. It was good, more like a really moist brownie bite than a lava cake. I would get it again, I would just have lower expectations of the lava piece!  

Everything else we had was fabulous. The goat butter with the artisanal breads was fantastic. The scallops were delicious and cooked perfectly.  Those who had the steak said it was delicious and cooked as requested. 

5+ stars for the staff! 4 stars for the food."
