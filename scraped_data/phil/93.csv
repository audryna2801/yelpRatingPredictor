5,"I highly recommend the spicy sopresata pizza. The honey is so good. We had the meatball appetizer, it came with pasta but both the meatballs and pasta were both pretty plain. Decent wine selection. Good service. Outdoor seating."
5,"This pizza was phenomenal and the service was spectacular, even with COVID. I had the shiitake mushroom pizza, which was amazing! It was the perfect balance of sweet and savory and the crust was thin but not quite thin crust style. Highly recommend!"
5,"Roma style, thin and crunchy crust pizza (spicy sausage is a win) and the caesar salad is made with crispy kale and loaded with white anchovies.  Prices are aggressively good, service was outstanding (outside table service, walk ups only) and they were doing a brisk take out business while we enjoyed our dinner."
5,"The best Neapolitan pizza I&apos;ve ever had !!

Been there many times and you can&apos;t beat it"
4,"From what I can remember, Nomad Pizza was the shop to pop my cherry on the idea of artisan pizza.

Growing up, I was really accustomed to a plain cheese pizza, nothing more - nothing less. So I developed a habit of steering away from speciality pizzas, let alone thin crust/brick oven/specialty flavor pizzas.

Then along came Nomad, and it changed everything for me. To me, their pizza&apos;s are 5 star. Super casual environment, with a really adventurous menu. They have pies that range from sweet, to spicy, to savory, and so on. You can taste how fresh their dough, vegetables, meats, etc. are! Seriously, it makes a difference.

Our favorite pie is the truffle pecorino - it has crazy depth in its flavor profile, balancing the saltiness of the cheese and mushrooms, with the nutty and earthy flavor of the truffle. I would recommend pairing this with a pie that has red sauce just so you can leave with a wholesome experience."
5,I love Nomads. Some of my favorite pizza in the city. Had a shiitake mushroom pie delivered today and it was hot and everything tasted fresh. Definitely recommend!
5,"Greetings all! Well, I have finally tried the Nomad Pizza and was not disappointed.

Shiitake Mushroom Pizza - There pizzas are a thing of beauty. My favorite mushroom by far is the Shiitake Mushroom so it was a no brainer that I ordered the Shiitake Mushroom Pizza. This pizza comes with eight ingriedents on it along with there imported mozzeralla di bufala which is included on four of there twelve staple pizza offerings. I added jalape√±os which I later regretted (the pizza has enough flavoring on it no need to add) and when I say I could eat an entire slice in one bite I was a little concerned ~ I have heard others mention there pizza could be quite addicting but whole slice one bite addicting, DANGER WILL ROBINSON!!

I am still in the midst of trying all highly regarded pizza places in the city and will attach a link to my recent Yelp Conversation thread which details many of them. Going back and forth to determine the best pizza on the planet I have decided it cannot be Soho style pizza. I will detail why in the next review as my next scheduled pizza spot I am going to on my pizza hit list is Square Pie this Sunday!

As always fellow yelpers SYOY!!!

2,"Ordered delivery, and it was awful. It was cold, there was barely any sauce, the cheese slid all over the pizza, and it was extremely soggy. I think the photo says it all. Not sure if I just had a one-off experience, but I won&apos;t be ordering from here again."
5,"Always a great pie from Nomad. Never disappoints. I highly recommend their entire menu. I&apos;ve tried probably every pie on their menu unless they added anything new recently, and it&apos;s always delicious. Great reheated too in the rare case any is leftover."
5,Best pizza in the city (says me). Hotly debated title. This place has great dough and innovative toppings. I like my pies a little under-done with very little char and they abide. The wood fire smoke gives it great flavor without a burnt taste. Most memorable variety would be the sweet corn sauce pizza they had years ago probably had soppresatta on it. They are soppresatta obssessed which I&apos;m into. I heard their place in Center City close so that is compelling me to go to the 7th Street original location very soon. We can&apos;t let great places disappear.
4,"4 Shitake Mushroom Pizza- Bufala, garlic, shiitake mushrooms, caramelized onion, black pepper. Flavor was great with this mushroom pizza but mushrooms and onions were a little too oily. Crust was great.

3 Roasted Root Salad- Roasted red &amp; golden beets, carrots, chevre, balsamic reduction. Would have preferred the roasted vegetables to be cooked and cooled prior to adding to the mixed greens. Flavor was good when you had a bite with the cheese but otherwise too oily and bland.

3 Arancini- Fried risotto balls mozzarella and basil, marinara. Arugula side salad. The fried breading was the best part of the arancini. Too much breading in the inside filler and the Basil was too overpowering in these little fried risotto balls. The marinara on the side had a little bit of a lemon flavor.

4 Overall- Staying unbiased based on how the food was prepared and flavor."
5,We keep coming back for this wonderful pizza. Never disappoints and service is great. Something for everyone. Want to try more pizzas.
2,"I want to preface this review by acknowledging that this is during COVID-19 and I understand that maybe not every meal out of a restaurant comes out at equal quality.

Having said that, I was looking forward to this because the food looks so good in the pictures, but this was honestly the most disappointing take-out I&apos;ve ever had in Philly. We ordered the spicy soppressata and shiitake mushrooms. The pizzas were room temperature and flimsy, undercooked. The sauce was very sweet, and the soppressata was pinkish greyish thicker slices rather than red thin slices as seen in all the other pictures. 

I was excited for this but knowing all the other good pizza here that we could&apos;ve eaten for a fun Friday movie night, I was very sad and let down after eating this."
5,"This was a tough one, but so far the best Neapolitan pie has to go to Nomads (and trust me, there are few other really good spots). When you could dine inside, they had traditional, long picnic tables for a rustic vibe. Half of bottle of wine on Wednesday&apos;s was a huge incentive.

But the pizza. Simple sauce, no frills. Fresh mozzarella. Perfectly burnt, yet doughy crust. This is what dreams are made of, my friend. 

Thank you, Nomads!"
5,"MY FAVORITE PIZZA. hands down. 

I have a long and loving relationship with Nomad Pizza. I&apos;ve been eating here since it opened many years ago. My favorite has always been the Truffle Pecorino pizza, but a more recent favorite is the Shitake Mushroom one (But really, they both have mushrooms... I love mushrooms, what can I say?) The Spicy Sausage is good too, but can be a little oily. Honestly, I&apos;ve never disliked a pizza from here. 

LOVEEE the Roasted Root Salad. They always offer this on the menu, but I have found it to differ slightly from year to year. 

They also have a great draft beer selection and happy hour specials throughout the week. 

Additionally, they are extremely family friendly and can accommodate a wide range of party sizes. However, I do recommend the seating upstairs better than downstairs. Downstairs has great views of outside and the street, but it is awfully cramped and the hostesses love seating parties uncomfortably close to one another. Upstairs lacks that view but you&apos;ll thank me in the end. 

Also IMO, this location is far superior than the Nomad Roman location. This location has a thicker, chewier dough/crust, while Nomad Roman has thin, not chewy crust. 

Let 7th St Nomad steal a pizza your heart"
1,"Literally delivered me a pizza with no cheese. Like for real? How do you forget to put the pizza on the cheese, and take it out of the oven and still say &quot;yeah looks good&quot;?"
4,"Came here for happy hour and had some great pizza! As far as happy hour drinks, I wish they had more options other than the house wine. The first glass I had was a little acidic but our server didn&apos;t have any problem opening another bottle. 

If you like thin crust pizzas,  then you&apos;ll love nomad&apos;s. We got mushroom and margherita, but the one that stole the show was their dessert- Nutella pizza! Topped with hazelnuts, strawberries, and powdered sugar. It&apos;s worth the diabetes. 

We also got the fried rice balls and salad which was fresh. Overall, great happy hour deals."
2,"I cannot get down with this pizza. 

We ordered two pies; h&apos;onion and spicy sausage. I liked the h&apos;onion more of the two. The red onions had some flavor but the sauce was bland and overall tasted like nothing. 

The spicy sausage was not spicy at all. I suspect there was no spice involved in the making of this sausage as there was no taste. The sauce on this pie was bland as well. 

The pie crust was the only redeeming quality of the pie. 

For this price point you can get much better chain pizza delivered to your door. Dining here is kind of awkward since it is just one long communal table downstairs that you seat yourself at. Puff puff pass."
5,"Popped in here for quick pizza, ordered the quartro Formaggio and wasn&apos;t disappointed. It was delicious, and the crust was thin and crispy. All pizzas here are artisan though, so if you&apos;re looking for something less artsy and expensive, this probably isn&apos;t for you."
2,The pizza was not very good unfortunately :(. We got the spicy soppressata and the shiitake mushroom delivered. It tasted like low-quality frozen pizza. The soppressata was unappetizing and grey-ish. Cheese was slimy. Toppings slid off the slice and the dough was undercooked. We wouldn&apos;t return.
