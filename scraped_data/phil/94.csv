5,"A PA staple!  What can get more Pennsylvania than a pretzel wrapped sausage lol  It&apos;s expensive here but totally worth it.  ~$4 per log.  You can taste the love the pretzels here are made with.  Perfectly salty, decadent... you just need to try it immediately.

Conveniently next to Beilers bakery.  A pairing for the ages."
5,"My life changed the day I stopped at this counter in Reading Terminal Market for something to snack on during the bus ride back to NYC.

I didn&apos;t even particularly like pretzels before then, but these looked so good. And they&apos;re really not like any kind of regular pretzel, so incredibly soft and buttery.

Now MIller&apos;s Twist is the highlight of any trip to Philadelphia. Heck, it&apos;s even worth a visit just to witness the skills of the Amish pretzel makers working right in front of you."
5,"No Reading Terminal Market trip is complete without a pretzel. You can see the pretzels being made in the back as well as the baked goodies coming out of the oven and brushed with butter before they are put in the display window. I try to limit myself to one every time I visit, as they are surprisingly filling."
5,"Best pretzels ever!!! Fresh and quick and so delicious! I got the Crab pretzel for my husband (it comes with a chunky crab dip), salted and the cinnamon sticks (six comes in the container and they&apos;re about 4/5 inches long) for the kids."
5,Seriously my favorite pretzels ever! I got a big pretzel dog. The pretzel was warm and buttery and you could tell they used quality beef hot dogs. It was absolutely delicious. I came back to get a sweet pretzel: the cinnamon sugar one. It was out of this world. I can&apos;t wait to go back to get more of these incredibly delicious pretzels.
5,"I heard that pretzels were a thing in Philadelphia. I&apos;m not a huge pretzel guy, but I was already in the market, so thought why not. I saw a bunch of pretzels, some looked plain, some wrapped hot dogs, I didn&apos;t think much of it and just asked for their most popular and they said it was just the normal plain pretzel. I got it and let me say this, for the next 2 days, I hunted for pretzels around Philadelphia. Went to pretzel factory, nope, not good since they weren&apos;t soft. Went back to this place on third day...and it was closed . 

Point is, these are amazing. They are soft and coated with sugar or cinnamon, buttered up. I then realized that this reminded me of a MUCH BETTER auntie Anne&apos;s and to no surprise, it was founded in Pennsylvania.

Best pretzel I&apos;ve ever had...single handedly changed my food itinerary in Philadelphia."
5,"Wow even if you don&apos;t like pretzels, you gotta give this place a chance. The line is long, but it moves fairly fast. We got the sausage, egg, and cheese pretzel roll, which was $4 but if you get two then it&apos;s $7. 

As soon as I was handed the pretzel, it warmed up my hand. The pretzel itself was well seasoned and soft, but chewy. The cheese melted as soon as you bit into the pretzel and the sausage completed the flavor profile of the entire pretzel. 

I&apos;m still dreaming about this pretzel, you need to try it to know what I&apos;m talkin about. Would recommend this place for all your breakfast needs!"
4,"Good pretzels, great prices, amazing people. I love a good pretzel and in a city where the opportunity to get one is plentiful, I recommend this pretzel shop inside the Reading Terminal Market if you want your Auntie Anne&apos;s fix without feeling like you are going there. 

No matter what time of day it is, it is always pretzel time if you love a good pretzel. And this is no exception."
5,"These are likely the best pretzels you will ever have.  They are fresh, soft and delicious, regardless of whether they are hot or cold.  We bought three of them (there is usually a 3 for $5 special) as a snack while we wandered around looking for an actual meal.  Before we knew it, there was only a half of a pretzel left.  I don&apos;t remember what we ended up eating for an actual meal, it was overshadowed by these pretzels!  There were so good, we were sad we didn&apos;t get extra before coming back to NYC.  I will not make that mistake next time."
4,"Well first off this spot is located in the Reading Terminal Market and it is jammed packed with lines around the corner for almost every eatery in the Reading Market for those virgins that have not been here so if you want something quick this spot is a perfect match, assuming you are a fan of hotdogs and pretzels or better yet a hotdog stuffed inside a pretzel.

I am deducting one star as the amount of salt sprinkled on the pretzel was not abundant enough.

Protip for those that are true hotdog enthusiasts - there is a upscale hotdog restaurant located in center city called &quot;Destination Dogs&quot;. I have this listed as one of my next go to spots but the dogs at Miller&apos;s Twist I would definitely return for and try more of there dogs."
5,"This place by far has the best pretzels I&apos;ve ever had. Their breakfast rolls made with pretzel dough are absolutely amazing! You&apos;ll find articles on the web that the Turkey Sausage, Egg, and Cheese Roll Up is something to try, and it definitely is. Definitely a place I&apos;ll be going back often for a breakfast roll!"
4,"Heard great things and had to stop by. We were disappointed that they didn&apos;t have the jalapeno cheddar pretzel that day. I&apos;m not sure if they stopped making them or their menu changes daily but we had a lot to eat already so just got the regular pretzels to see what all the hype is about. I honestly think it&apos;s the dough. It doesn&apos;t make you feel bad eating it, not too heavy and the bread is just the right amount. If we didn&apos;t eat elsewhere before, we would have probably tried the wrapped hot dogs. I don&apos;t think you could go wrong with your selection here at all!"
4,"Really good pretzel twists and lemonade. I got the cheese sauce and spicy sweet mustard. It tasted like honey mustard to me, which I know they also have, but it is my first time here so I don&apos;t know if it just didn&apos;t taste as expected or if I was given the wrong one. Either way, it was all pretty good. The girl at the counter was very nice. I would stop in again."
5,"Move over Auntie Anne&apos;s and hello Uncle Miller! My manager recommended this spot that specializes in pretzels, located at the Reading Terminal Market. 

But it&apos;s not just any pretzel... IT&apos;S STUFFED. I got the sausage, egg, and cheese stuffed pretzel for breakfast. And it was such a game changer. I got their sweet n spicy mustard to dip which added a nice horseradish kick. I expected the pretzel roll to be thick and lots of bread to bite through but it was thin, with the filling to bread ratio being perfect. Soft, fluffy, and fresh!

It&apos;s $3.75 for 1 but you can get 2 for $6. Get two. Do it. Cause I didn&apos;t and now I have regrets. :("
3,"Another 3.5 rating.

So pretzels are my thing!! I just absolutely love it. Thank goodness for the person who invented them! I&apos;m also a snob when it comes to pretzels. Quality is everything and Miller&apos;s Twist simply tasted like the other pretzel store that&apos;s commonly found in malls. 

So I orderded the cinnamon sugar and a regular pretzel both were a little bland, overly chewy and just to thick in terms of pretzels. I prefer a basic soft pretzel, the kind that comes with a water ice.

Miller&apos;s Twist is located in the reading terminal.It&apos;s a long line but it moves quickly. Service was friendly and prices were good. I paid about 5.00 for my 2 pretzels. They also have cheesesteak pretzels and pretzel dogs for those who like a variety. 

Overall if your in the area. Check them out!"

Miller&apos;s Twist is located in Reading Terminal Market. 

The pretzel is warm and buttery which reminds me of Lancaster pretzels which I enjoy.

The line moves quick.  The cashier could be a bit friendlier.

I&apos;ll be back"
5,"The pretzels are incredibly buttery, soft and warm on the inside with a stiff (but not crunchy) outer layer.  Always served hot out of the oven as the volume/turnover means you&apos;re never getting and old/cold pretzel.

We were lucky enough to get there early enough that they hadn&apos;t sold out of their stuffed pretzel (egg, cheese and ham)...it was handheld awesome...melty cheese, fluffy egg and ham inside the perfect crispy pretzel...I could have eaten three!

So good this was both the first stop and the last stop during our incredibly long lunch break in the Reading Terminal Market (we hit over 6 different eateries)."
3,"Not bad but also not something to write home about. It was pretty large and 3 of shared just to have a taste. The pretzel needed more salt, the pretzel itself was kind of bland. The filling was decent and had a good amount of whiz. On the plus side, it was piping hot. Place was packed when we went and there was a line. 2 of us had time to go to the restroom and back while the other waited in line."
5,"I love pretzels, and any time I&apos;m in Philly, I have to stop by Miller&apos;s Twist at Reading Terminal Market. It&apos;s one of my favorite stalls there, and every pretzel I&apos;ve gotten has been perfect - soft and chewy, buttery, and just the right amount of salt. They have flavored pretzels, roll-ups, ice cream, and more, but their regular pretzel is all I need to be happy. Simple, but delicious."
4,"Came by this place for a good pretzel while I was in Reading Terminal. There was hardly any line. The girl greeted me nicely, and waited to take my order. I chose a classic &apos;Salted Soft Pretzel.&apos; 

The flavor of the pretzel was extremely fresh and delicious. In my opinion, these taste very similar to the Auntie Anne&apos;s Style, meaning they have more of a &quot;buttery bread&quot; flavor. 

I have also tried the ice cream here before, which is extremely fresh, delicious, and tastes authentic. I would definitely recommend this place as a great stop for a fresh snack."
