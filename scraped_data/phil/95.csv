5,"After the City of Philly gave the  green light on outdoor dining, I knew I wanted to fine a restaurant with a view.  I went to my trustworthy Yelp, did a search and BOOM &quot;In Riva&quot; appeared.

When we arrived to this cozy place located near the water on Kelly Drive we were greeted  by a hostess. Because of the COVID virus everything was set-up outside of the restaurant with one hostess taking your name, another taking your cocktail order and another to seat you.  Now that&apos;s service and organization.  

We went on a Saturday (6/13) around mid-day and my cousin figured since it was the first day of opening, dining would be crowded.  There was a crowd but was within the PA guidelines - everyone wearing masks.   

Our wait to be seated was not long, however, while waiting we had a cocktail in the parking lot which was set-up with a few picnic tables and umbrellas.

Just as we started to enjoy our cocktails (a Letti and a Sangria) the hostess escorted us to our table with a great view overlooking Kelly Drive and the river. Perfect!  The area has enough trees for shade however, there are tables with umbrellas.  

We decided from the  start that we would go Tapas style (small plates) instead of their pizza.  We started off (to share) with the Arugula &amp; Mushroom salad with shallots and parmigiana. The Heirloom tomato&apos;s with mozzarella and opal basil. Both fresh and large enough to share.

Our second order was Charred Octopus with black olive and cherry tomatoes. The Whipped Riscotta with roasted onions and rosemary. 

But the star of the show was the Pea Soup w/roasted garlic with parmigiano and the Branzino with olive dressing and charred lemon. Amazing:)

If you&apos;re ever in the city and are looking for a casual spot with a great view, The Riva is the spot.   Five Star for good food, great view and excellent service by our hostess Hailey."
5,"This spot is a local fave of mine! They currently have a great outdoor dining spot on their patio, but I opt for take out mostly. I got the Gnocchi, Arugula salad, and broccoli pizza all to go. All three were still hot and extremely fresh by the time I got home. The gnocchi was so delicious, I wanted more. Next time, I might get two orders of it! The pizza and salad were a great combo. I will order these exact items again as soon as possible."
3,"This is such a cool place in East Falls. Right on the water, big outdoor seating area, super vibrant and full of great energy. When we are out of the pandemic, make sure this is on top of your list for places to visit if you are in the Philly area.

They are known for their Napoletana, wood-fired pizzas. They have a nice variety of options - our favorite is the margherita, but if you wanted to try something on the wild side, pay homage to the city and try the philly roast pork. 

We thought their whipped ricotta appetizer was fire though - we could come back just for that!"
4,"In Riva is worth it for the ambience alone. There is an excellent patio with outdoor seating and plenty of heat lamps. I came on a Sunday after a walk at the nearby Wissahickon. We were seated promptly and tables were appropriately spaced. I was not in the mood to drink, but bottomless cocktails and/or mimosas are $25 (!!!) on weekends from 12-3. 

I opted for the cipolla pizza which was good but lacking flavor. It definitely could have used more balsamic. However, the crust was excellent. I then opted for dessert which was the star of the meal. I especially loved the chocolate budino which was a combination or raspberry and chocolate. I could have eaten 3 more although it was incredibly rich. 

Overall, the setting is lovely and great care was taken to ensure a safe dining experience."
4,"Came here for business meetings as it was highly recommended by a few people and a good central location to meet my colleague.  Post Covid there is ample outdoor seating and pre Covid there were sufficient tables but very often required a wait if reservations were not made.  The staff is very welcoming and the experience is warm and cozy.  

As I was running late in arriving and the drink specials were ending the wait staff was able to put my drink order in and poured it once I arrived, that is ALWAYS a plus!  While having the meeting the waiter came around to make sure our drinks were steady flowing and knew just when we were ready to order our food.  We ordered a few pizzas to share.  It was at that moment that I realized why this place was highly recommended.  The pizzas were delicious, the crust was perfect and the toppings were perfectly distributed.

Would definitely conduct more meetings or even swing by for to go orders in the future."
3,"*pre covid review*

My friends and I came here before covid struck and had a good meal. We ordered:
The whipped ricotta appetizer, wine, cocktails, pepperoni pizza, sausage and peppers pizza and a little dessert at the end. 

My favorite parts were the wine and the dessert. The wines they had were delicious and the dessert was not too sweet. The appetizer was good but I wished there was more of the acidic element to balance the cheese and bread. 
As for the pizza it was definitely not bad by any means but I didn&apos;t enjoy it as much as I was hoping I would based on other reviews and pictures. 

Overall I would still recommend coming here to try it yourself since not everyone will agree with me!"
4,"I visited In Riva for brunch this past weekend and was thoroughly impressed! This is a cute quaint authentic Italian restaurant with a instagram worthy aesthetic. I was happy with the &quot;bottomless&quot; brunch drink specials (note: they aren&apos;t bottomless but they&apos;re so cheap they might as well be). The food was absolutely amazing! Every dish outdid the last. We ordered a bevy of shareable sizes apps, including the Pepperonata, Broccolini Cesar Salad, Charred Octopus, and Whipped Ricotta. My Entree spaghetti w/ King Crab was so impressive the other 5 ppl in my party ordered it as a second entree to go! The dessert left a lot to be desired however. They have free parking onsite and then there is a cheap self pay lot across the street (think $6 for 2.5 hours). I look forward to visiting and trying more dishes. 9/10 would highly recommend."
3,"For a very cool looking place with a great view, it&apos;s very underwhelming. The patio is very nice and the happy hour is great but service and food was very lackluster. 

We got a marghertia pizza and a broccoli pizza. The broccoli pizza was so bland and only tasted like the garlic they put on it. The marghertia was alright but very &quot;floppy&quot; like the crust wasn&apos;t crisp enough to keep it from falling. All the cheese went with it too. I like the wood fire crust, but it was sooo bland. I double checked to see if I was actually eating chard cardboard. 

The service was AWFUL. Our waitress was really attentive in the beginning (and she made it very clear that we had a 2 hour limit) yet disappeared for an HOUR. We watched as people say after us ate, paid and left. It was so annoying trying to get her attention as she was obviously avoiding us."
5,"Had a delicious meal! Split 2 pizzas and had a delicious appetizer AKA just bread and more cheese (pictured). Wasn&apos;t sure what to expect as it was our first time but I was very impressed with the staff, service and food."
5,"I LOVED this place. It is seriously my new favorite spot. Funny because I have driven by it 100&apos;s of times on my way to and from the work &amp; city. Each time I go by I think to myself how I need to go and I finally ended up stopping in.

The vibe inside was really cool. It was a Saturday around noon and buzzing with a good brunch crowd. My husband and I had made a reservation but didn&apos;t need it. We asked for seats over at a chef&apos;s counter so we could watch all of the food prep and pizzas being made. It was entertaining! I&apos;d suggest sitting here if you can, or outside if it is warm out. They have seating that overlooks Kelly Dr and the river.

My husband and I split a salad and a pizza. We opted for the broccolini caesar (absolutely amazing - must get) and the pepperoni pizza (equally as awesome, very crunchy pepperonis). Both had a lot of char from the pizza oven which we love. We were really excited about both dishes and can&apos;t wait to come back over and over again to try new things.

*They have a parking lot but the spots are EXTREMELY tight."
4,"I would normally give this place 5 stars as it&apos;s my favorite go to place. During quarantine it has been unfortunate as the take out pasta dishes are not their normal portions. I keep trying to give it the benefit of the doubt. But the pasta isn&apos;t much of a portion for take out. 
The bucatini is what you would feed to a toddler from your plate, and the gemelli not much more... the pizzas are still wonderful and the usual size. The pasta was delicious. Just wont eat take out regularly here due to current pasta sizes for take out."
4,"Tasty fancy pizza. There are some unique flavors offered here. It&apos;s a nice brunch spot situated near the water, but under Rt 1. There&apos;s a small lot outside the restaurant or one across the street that&apos;s paid metered.

The pizza is good. There are non-traditional toppings that are quite fancy. I enjoy stopping by an off hour because there is generally a wait during peak times. 

The calamari is also a delicious starter."
4,"I really love the decor of this place, inside and out. I&apos;ve only sat in the outside section and it&apos;s really cozy and perfect for a date night. They even have a section for dogs called pups n&apos; pizza. I wish they had heat lamps or a fire pit outside for those colder nights. 

The pizza is always good and tasty. One pie is large enough for 2, maybe 3 people depending how hungry you are. I ordered the pepperoni pizza the last time I went and it was delicious. It&apos;s a little doughy and greasy though. The cheese &amp; meat plates are also good. 

Service could be faster but overall it&apos;s not bad. For the area, In Riva is a decent pizza spot if you don&apos;t feel like venturing out to the city."
5,"Ordered through Caviar for pickup and the pizzas were delicious! The Quattro Formaggio (top) and Margarheta (bottom) were chewy yet crispy, light, and flavorful in the most tasteful ways."
4,"Had their pizza and draft wine. Really good pizza although a bit expensive for the amount you&apos;re getting. They had outdoors seating, appropriately distanced. A bit of a wait for the pizzas but the server was pleasant and tried to keep things moving. Worth a visit."
5,"I love this place! I live close by and this is my go to dinner and happy hour place!

The food is always good. You can&apos;t go wrong with the pizza and the pasta dishes are amazing! Although at first glance the pasta portions may be small, this is actually how much we should eat in a serving anyway... if you&apos;re super hungry, go with the pizza!

The location is great. It&apos;s right off of Kelly drive so it&apos;s a short distance from just about anywhere in the city. When the weather is nice, you can enjoy sitting on the patio out back. There is covered and uncovered seating.

There is a separate area for dog lovers which is nice for animal lovers and those who do not want to dine with dogs!

You can&apos;t go wrong with this place."
2,Too little food for too much money. Wouldn&apos;t go again. The interior design is pretty cool but not worth it for the money imo.
4,"I&apos;ve driven past In Riva so many times while going down Kelly Drive and I always thought it looked so cute. Well I finally decided to give it a try with my boyfriend. The look of the place, in general, is very welcoming I think. I love the bikes on the front. 

Overall, they have a pretty solid menu with a lot of options. They have several pizza and pasta options which seem to be the favorites there. My boyfriend ordered the pizza which is woodfire so that alone I think makes it delicious. He really enjoyed it though and said that flavor was good. We split the grilled octopus and it was so TINY. It was pretty expensive for how small it was too. But it was delicious. It was paired with a cherry olive sauce which surprisingly worked well together! For my main dish, I got the &quot;spicy&quot; chicken parm. It definitely wasn&apos;t spicy, I think the spicy aspect was that it came with a long hot pepper. That being said it was still delicious. The dish is technically an appetizer but the waitress said it was a bigger one, so I decided to go for it. It was a single chicken thigh which I thought wasn&apos;t going to be much but it was actually very filling! I loved it. I would definitely recommend the dish because the chicken was moist and the sauce flavorful. 

I think I would definitely visit here again! The food is good, but kind of pricey given the portion sizes."
3,"I love InRiva and the food, however, I think there is a lot to be desired with the service.  I recently dined at InRiva and asked for coffee. The waitress comes to the table with a 1/4 of coffee stating that this was the last they and asked me if I wanted them to make a new pot and also asked me if I wanted the 1/4 cup. Of course I said no. I love InRiva&apos;s food and eat here all the time but that experience turned me off a bit."
