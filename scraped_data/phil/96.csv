5,"This cafe is an ideal spot for brunch any nice morning. We chose to sit outside due to COVID capacity limits but it did not disappoint. The outside patio was cozy and ideal! The service, food, and atmosphere was the highlight of our weekend. I would recommend for any and all breakfast lovers!"
5,"Beautiful location, went there for brunch and it was delicious. Chicken waffles and their eggs were delicious. I can&apos;t wait to go again! They had also spaced out the tables which made me feel safe during these Covid times."
4,"I go to Drexel University, so Sabrina&apos;s was totally recommended to me!!

My visit here was way pre covid, so I&apos;m unsure of any of their precautions and procedures!

I went here on a brunch date with my boyfriend. Surprisingly, I&apos;ve only been here once! 

The wait was not long and the service was great! We were seated in an adorable little table near a window where we could look out onto the street.

I&apos;m not entirely sure of our orders, but there is a picture included. It seems like my boyfriend got a cheese burger with onions only and I may have gotten the house burger. I can see the egg so that&apos;s what I would assume! I remember it being so so messy but SO delicious! On the side we have the cheesey home fries which were also very good!

Overall I really enjoyed this place and I&apos;m glad there is one close to home because I will definitely be back!"
3,"Atmosphere: Sabrina&apos;s Cafe is a cozy restaurant/cafe about a 5 minute Uber drive from Penn&apos;s campus. The interior is welcoming and colorful. We went pre-COVID lockdowns and were seated by the large windows. Loved the natural lighting!

Service: The servers were nice, and we had no problems with ordering, receiving food, or paying!

Food: We ordered the Challah French Toast and Two Eggs Any Style (over easy) with country white bread. The French Toast was a solid breakfast item, but it was on the heavier side - we had to pack a lot of it in a to-go box because we couldn&apos;t finish it dining in. The two eggs any style neither impressed or disappointed us. For being a &quot;local favorite&quot; to some, we were rather unmoved by our brunch experience, as there wasn&apos;t anything particularly spectacular about our meal.

Overall: A rather average brunch meal that was reflected by the cost. There were not any major pitfalls or highlights, which is why we solidly gave Sabrina&apos;s Cafe a 3."
3,I like that we were able to order and pick up . This location doesn&apos;t deliver and when you called the staff had limited information on the directions to order online. Overall the food was ok it was cold by the time we got home and after reheating the stuffed French toast they didn&apos;t seem fresh. I think we so many options around the philly area I will try something else for breakfast/brunch. My spouse got the grits with egg sandwich. Grits had way too much cheese and needed some salt and there was way too much eggs on the small English muffin not pictured. Also the price was a little much if you ask me. I gave them a 3 star because packaging was good and looks like they enforce strict Covid precautions.
4,"My sister picked this place for Sunday brunch. We didn&apos;t know anything about it. The first thing that I loved was the building it&apos;s in. I have a thing for houses with rooms that are rounded turrets and this building has one. I actually said to my husband, &quot;Oh wow, look at that building,&quot; and then got really excited when I realized it was our destination. So aside from the cool building (which we discovered is somehow related to neighboring Drexel University), we had a very nice brunch.

The only reason really that this is not a five star review is the way we were treated at the start of our meal. My sister got there early and got on the list. They refused to seat her until we got there (always so annoying). Then once we arrived, the hostess sat several tables before us, even after she told my sister we were next. When we finally said something to her about it, she mumbled something about us being next. We were finally seated and things took a turn up from there.

So they have a pretty extensive coffee menu, including some really fun lattes and stuff. I got one that was kind of like hazelnut hot chocolate and was really yummy. I got an eggs benedict and was super happy to learn that you can get any kind of meat you want in the benedict - and I got scrapple because then I could get my scrapple fix too while I was at it. It was kind of weird to have scrapple benedict but pretty tasty. The scrapple was nice and crispy. The eggs were poached well. I just wished their was more hollandaise. The potatoes were good. My sister got an omelette, which looked awesome. My brother in law got french toast and my husband got something that I can&apos;t remember. But overall, we were all very satisfied and stuff. Service was decent though I thought that could have been a little better too. But overall a pretty solid brunch. Very busy though - be prepared to wait."
5,"Woah was this an experience. Sabrina&apos;s is right by Drexel and UPenns campus and is a really great brunch place to go to. This places gets filled fast and I would suggest to reserve spot on the wait list here to make sure that you will be seated in the time that you want. They were very good at keeping me updated on when my reservation was ready and even called me 5 minutes before they were ready. Interior is very much like any brunch place in the city that is more Woody styled. They also fit a table of 8 which was great. 

The food:
Pro tip, get a bunch of food with people and share. 
I personally got the French Toast and it was nice and sweet with lots of cream that was to die for. It was very sizable and was delicious.
I thought having the tots was a great plus because it was very savory and was delicious with the caramelized onions and everything in it. 
The Huevos Rancheros was also very savory and really helped me balance the French toast. 
There was lots of food like chicken and waffles that was delicious and sandwiches.

Overall, you can never go wrong at Sabrina&apos;s."
5,"This is one of my favorite brunch spots in University City. Sabrina&apos;s Cafe is right near Drexel University&apos;s campus. There&apos;s street parking available and the restaurant is very cozy and has a casual atmosphere. Sabrina&apos;s is popular though so expect a wait, especially if you&apos;re with a group. I went with one other person and we were seated immediately but groups of four or larger had to wait for a table. 

The waitress was very friendly and constantly checked on my table to see if I wanted more coffee and if the food&apos;s to my liking. I ordered from their special fall menu and everything tasted so delicious. The &quot;Hello Gourdeous&quot; Special French Toast is similar to Sabrina&apos;s signature Challah French Toast but with different toppings. Their French toast is pretty sweet, so I&apos;d recommend getting something savory to go along with it. 

Most of their items are around $10-15 which is pretty typical for brunch places in the area. The only downside to my experience was that it took some time for the food to come out. The restaurant was very busy and the waitress did come to my table and apologized for how long the wait was. 

I love Sabrina&apos;s and I&apos;d highly recommend!"
2,"I came on Sunday to brunch for a friends birthday. The food was bland, as usual. But I knew it was going to be before I arrived (go for the sweet dishes - they need work on savory). The Black Bean Grits are a sin! Why fix grits if they ain&apos;t broke? My friend said they tasted just like beans. I don&apos;t get it - grits are easy to make great. I got a dish called The Tots. The &quot;tator tot&quot; was more like a little knish. That was the best part. The sausage was eh and the veggies were too big for my liking. The veggies were bigger than sausage. And the eggs were bland. The aioli was tasty but that was it. 

The real issue was the lack of cleanliness and the GNATS! They were excessive. I felt like I was eating them. We were swiping them away left and right. 

We finally got to the manager. They told us that because the building was old that&apos;s why the gnats were present. (Sketchy) Also, they said that they&apos;d called the exterminators 6 times over the past week and yadda yadda but that they still didn&apos;t do their job. It took him forever to just apologize. And then he comp&apos;d our bill. Forget the comp, I feel like they shouldn&apos;t be open with such a gross problem. Furthermore, the cleanliness was lacking and their ice was exposed the entire time. Gross. 

Safe to say, I&apos;m not coming back."
5,"Brunch here is amazing, but always has super long waits on weekends. Thankfully, it uses the yelp waitlist system so you can just put yourself on the waitlist before you head out and head over closer to your time. On a Sunday morning at around 10:30 AM, the wait was about 90 minutes, so highly recommend using the waitlist. 

The food was really good and they always have nice seasonal menus. My friend and I got the egg Benedict and huevo rancheros. The huevo rancheros was really good and filling! Had a good mix of all flavors and would definitely come back to get it again! :) overall a super nice place to hang out with friends while getting great brunch food! Definitely one of the best brunch places in university city"
5,"Always a joy! I ADORE this place. Skip the regular menu. Their specials are always rocking and innovative. This round I got chicken and waffles. The herb butter totally made it out of this world! The pistachio latte was super tasty. My beau got the spice, spice baby buffalo chicken sandwich. He said it smelled spicier than it was, which would be good for people like me who can&apos;t do super spicy. The fries were yummy too. Everything is beautifully plated in within a really homey house/restaurant. 

If you are battling a decision of where to go when in Philly for breakfast, you can never go wrong with Sabrina&apos;s. Whenever I&apos;m in town, I always come back."
5,"I. Love. This. Place.

Whenever I have friends visiting from out of town, this is where I take them! My favorite items here are the stuffed French toast and the Mexi scramble. Pesto in eggs? Who would have known? 

The Mexi scramble seems basic, but is SO flavorful and delicious -- I crave it constantly and have never had anything like it anywhere else. At a certain point, there&apos;s only so much you can do with eggs, until Sabrina&apos;s proves you wrong!

Get the stuffed French toast -- thank me later. If you&apos;re more of a savory breakfast person but want to try it, pro tip: THEY OFFER HALF ORDERS! Seriously some of the BEST French toast I have ever eaten in my life. Whatever fluffy cream they stuff that toast with is stuff straight from heaven. No exaggeration. Pure bliss.

Bonus: they have sriracha AND Cholula here, which is basically the best thing ever.

I recommend getting on their waitlist if you&apos;re coming on a busy weekend during peak hours -- this is an easy and convenient system and the staff is always super helpful and it goes smoothly. Restrooms are clean, and the restaurant is beautiful. 

Before coming to Sabrina&apos;s, I really thought brunch was so normalized and I had seen it all in all it&apos;s variations -- thank you for proving me wrong and getting me excited to get up early enough to share a meal here!"
3,"A pretty decent brunch place at a good price. 

We reserved a spot online and made sure to arrive on time with 2 people ahead of us on the waitlist... After we checked in, we were told it would be another 30-40 min wait... It is a popular spot so we understood the wait. 

We were eventually seated, and greeted immediately. Our server didnt tell us about any drink specials, nor did I see a drink menu, so we just ordered orange juices... Only after this did we realize that only 1 out of the 3 specials menu we received had a drinks menu on the back. Our server was perfectly pleasant, but I had to get up during the meal to ask for extra syrup for the table because she never stopped by after our food came to ask how we were doing. Also, my water glass was empty for a while until the next time she stopped by so that I could ask for a refill. She dropped the check off while we were still eating--normally I wouldn&apos;t care too much, but she had barely stopped by during the meal... and then dropped off our check early lol.

The food itself was fine. My friend ordered the challah french toast and noted that she didn&apos;t think the bread was soaked in the french toast mixture long enough before cooking... My chicken and waffles were good, average enough, but as I mentioned, they were kind of stingy on the syrup. We also ordered the loaded fries... the fries weren&apos;t particularly crisp, and the eggs on top contributed to sogginess. The flavors were fine I guess. 

Overall, I would have given the meal 4 stars, but considering the disappointing service I had to lower my rating to 3 stars. I feel like there are so many places to go to for brunch, I wouldn&apos;t necessarily go out of my way to wait for a long time to eat standard brunch food and be ignored by our server lol"
5,"Walked here in the cold and the steamed apple cider quickly warmed me up! The tots were very filling and were panko breaded potatoes, sausage, peppers, onions, over easy egg and sour cream. It was delicious! My friend said the French toast was really sweet but so big she could only finish half. 

The wait was only about 10 minutes and the service was incredible. Glad I got to visit this during my weekend trip to Philly!"
4,"I got the bagel and lox, my wife got the Avocado Toast with Poached Egg.  Both were great.  The people next to us got the French Toast.  That looked good as well.  

Service was slow but partly due to everyone being seated at the same time."
4,"One of my go-to brunch spots in Philly!

Huge tip: reserve a spot on the app so you don&apos;t have to wait in person! by doing this, I only waited 3 minutes when I arrived at the door 

(+) The Tots - I was expecting typical tater tots but rather they gave me fluffy, pillowy potato cakes with a nice side of egg and sauce."
4,"What a cute brunch spot!!! Walked here from UPENN campus and was pleasantly surprised with the cozy atmosphere. Service was great, the hostess and waitresses are so kind. The seasonal lattes and menu items are worth checking out for brunch! The portion sizes are fair and definitely filling. Can&apos;t wait to come back."
5,"Great cafe, the food is delicious. The service was great. Awesome vibe, Try the chicken and waffles or the huevos rancheros."
4,"Love Sabrinas! Only gave this place 4 stars because it&apos;s literally so small in here it&apos;s a bit uncomfortable, however, it doesn&apos;t stop me from coming back to get some of that delicious food! (I prefer sitting outside in the summer) I always get the avocado toast, build my own omelet and veggie sausage fried well done. Yum!"
4,"Sabrina&apos;s is definitely a Philadelphia staple not to be missed! Young and hip, the vibe is casual, the menu is eclectic, and I never leave hungry. 

This University City location is unique in that it is located within a campus building. Pros - cute atmosphere, ability to order food to go and chill in the student lounge upstairs to avoid the long wait. Cons - very busy spot filled with university students! 

Although you can&apos;t make a reservation, the yelp waitlist has helped me avoid the ever-present long wait. If you choose to brave the wait, this location has a take out area where you can order a coffee and hang out while you wait.

The menu is amazing - breakfast staples plus a rotating list of seasonal specials. I love their unique blends of ingredients - you never know what&apos;s going to be on the menu at Sabrinas! Some of my favorite dishes include the Challah French Toast (get one for the table to share), the ultimate mexi scramble, the wild mushroom frittata, and the huevos rancheros. 

Overall, if you&apos;re willing to brave the wait, Sabrina&apos;s is an amazing spot for a delicious and original brunch with friends!"
