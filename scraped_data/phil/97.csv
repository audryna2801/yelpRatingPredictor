5,"Very good food and very friendly people. We get takeout from this restaurant almost every Friday night, and it is always good. I love the steamed dumplings, the summer rolls, the tofu with vegetables, the lemon grass chicken, and many other things.

Every once in a while I try a dish and I don&apos;t like it, but that is more a reflection of my taste than the cooking.So to the reviewers on here who post terrible reviews because they didn&apos;t enjoy a single dish, I would suggest that they make sure it&apos;s actually the restaurant and not a mismatch with their taste before they bash a place

What&apos;s more is that the people who run the restaurant are very nice. I often chat with them for a few minutes while my food is finishing up, and they are friendly and super nice. 

Food is always ready on time, although I find it is better to give them a little bit of extra time than some restaurants (which I suspect don&apos;t make things from scratch to order), Here, everything tastes freshly cooked."
5,"Our return visit since March with the pandemic outbreak.  Still, the same, wonderful, catering, great food restaurant... just with a whole bunch of new safety protocols so that dinners and staff can all enjoy a safe experience together. 

We called made a reservation, they offered outside on Walnut or just inside by the front.  Our table was waiting for our arrival.  They are using paper menus, consider it a take away gift to remember what you ate.

Such a pleasant, warm, and friendly intro by Bonnie the Bartender) who took great care of us.

We started off with two wonderful glasses of wine from their selection, my wife the Savugoin Blanc and the Reisling for me.  Since had been so many months we opt to share all dishes and spread each out as a course staring with the shrimp shumai (8 pieces), steamed oriental shrimp and crab dumpling with yellow curry dipping sauce.  Delicate, lovely texture, the memorable flavor; hence, WONDERFUL.  Nothing like what we get closer to home.  

Our second dish was the curry puff (4 pieces), chicken, potato, carrot, green peas wrapped in a flaky light pastry.  Was heavenly.  Delicate, full of flavor.  Trust me, a must-have.

Our third dish was the green curry with chicken, green curry paste, coconut milk with string beans, mushrooms, eggplant, bamboo shoots, bell peppers, zucchini, and basil.  The chicken was so tender, nice mouth bite-size pieces, cooked to perfection.  A light hint of spice and overall, a delightful dish that we both devoured it.  

For our last course, we tried a dish we never had before, the  Asian taco with duck- 2 pieces (and a nice size portion), Thai roti pancake filled with BBQ duck, onion, bell pepper, tomato, corn, and avocado.  WOW!!! A home run fun unexpecting dish.  Another must-try dish. 

All in all a 5! more like a 10.  Such an attentive staff, courteous, friendly, and they know the names of their regular patrons; one day they&apos;ll remember our faces (mask or not). 

See our food photos."
5,"Can&apos;t believe it took us almost 5 more years (and many, many other Thai restaurants) to order again from Xiandu. I back up my original opinion that they have some of the best delivery fried calamari in the city - not greasy, perfectly fried/cooked, SOOOOO good! Pad thai with chicken was excellent, too. I ordered a new dish for me - the Xiandu chicken. HUGE portion, lots of vegetables (even more chicken), and the sauce was a great spicy/sweet combo. Looking forward to trying their curries, and think we may FINALLY have found a go-to Thai place! Yay!"
3,"Got take out and it was just ok.  We got chicken pad thai, shrimp pad thai, and samosas.  The pad thai didn&apos;t have much flavor.  It definately needed more sauce and was a bit dry.  There are much better spots for pad thai here in the city. 

The samosas were flavorful and crispy. I would probably get those again if I ever found myself ordering from here again"
4,"Good food. Drunken noodles definitely hit the spot and were a great level of spice. Service was incredibly fast and accommodating, however the server was a bit overbearing at times. Overall a good experience!"
5,"This place has been around for a while and I remember when it before when it was a sushi restaurant. Anyhow this place is great for the value of the food as well as the service. Honestly, they have the most friendliest waiters and waitresses for a restaurant of this scale. In terms of the price I&apos;ve always gone for lunch and their lunch specials are great for the price.  If you&apos;re in the mood for Asian fusion type meal in a nice setting, I&apos;d recommend Xiandu."
3,"Excited to have outdoor seating and dining experience despite the pandemic.

Location is great and located with many shops around. A very eclectic selection/combinations of food to eat! I ordered the duck entree and the laksa noodle soup. Laksa soup was on point but I feel they are skimping out a bit on the condiments compared to other places I&apos;ve been. The duck was good, it is sweeter sauce and gives a good portion size. I was disappointed with the roti because the chicken that comes with was small, wish it was a bigger portion or charge more? 

The service was good, they were very accommodating but the tables were extremely sticky. Not sure if thats the case with the regular tables inside. 

Recommending this place but could not say it was great as I have had better thai experiences. I will definitely try again as it is local and has a great selection."
5,"This place is incredible!! Best food ever, amazing service, follows Covid protocols. Great drinks too!"
5,Soo good. We were in PA for 10 days and ordered from here like 3 times. Everything was fabulous
4,"Delicious food, well prepared with fresh ingredients, the staff was very friendly &amp; quick, I will definitely be back"
5,"Found this diamond in the rough while searching for Thai food.  Came after visiting the Museum with my daughter (on 12/26). A fifteen minute ride by uber from the museum.   

The restaurant is cool with Thai/Asian influence.  The service was good, our waitress was pleasant and always stop by to make sure we were satisfied with our food and drinks.

After surfing the menu we decided to go with the Crispy Spring rolls, Red Curry which came with jasmine rice and the Pad Kee Mao - similar to drunken noodles. Typically their food is spicy but you can always request they decrease the spice level.   My cocktail of choice was the Martini Lychee...yummy
 
Haven&apos;t been to many Thai restaurants in Philly but this one is on my list to come back to."
5,"Absolutely amazing Penang curry with steamed tofu.. when I asked for spicy they knew I meant it and it was made that way-variety of vegetables and the blend of sauces with the spice clicked.
They have a nice outdoor seating and takeout! Simply one of the best in Philly!"
4,This is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in center city Philadelphia. My personal favorite is the Tom yum soup and the pad Thai. The food quality and taste is excellent. Ambience is good and the service is quick. Food price is also fair. All of our friends also enjoyed their spring rolls. I definitely recommend this place and I would love to come back and dine again. There is ample street parking too. Don&apos;t forget to order their pineapple fried rice.
5,"Absolute FAVORITE THAI restaurant ever!!! Clean, Great service, food, owner is so friendly and inviting.
Best Shumai ever, too! Son&apos;s favorite is the Spicy Mango chicken. Great prices make it our favorite place to keep coming back to over and over again."
5,Went here on Valentine&apos;s Day for lunch the food was delicious we got a few small plates soup and the spicy Indian beef. I was very impressed with the flavor and how tender the beef was! And they didn&apos;t skimp on the quantity of beef either. The cocktails are great too. Cucumber basil gimlet was very refreshing. Great customer service and next time I visit Philadelphia I will come back to eat here great food and drinks! Check this place out
5,"I was pleasantly surprised by this Thai place. I first I was skeptical because it&apos;s located across from Hamilton the Broadway show so there were a lot of white people inside the restuarant. So I thought it would be Americanized. But it&apos;s actually a cute spot with great happy hour prices and portion. 

Happy Hour is daily from 5 to 7 PM. Select cocktails are $6. I had the tropical sunrise which had coconut which was delicious. Select appetizers are $4 which included the ratoni with side of curry. Select entrees are $7 which include chicken pad Thai. It was a good portion and I liked how it had bean sprouts, thinly sliced eggs and small chopped tofu. It may not be traditional Thai but I like the Chinese spin on it. I feel the owner is Chinese because I heard them speaking Mandarin.

I&apos;ll definitely be back if I crave Thai food!"
5,"Sooo delicious!! The restaurant is still open during COVID pandemic but with different operation hours. I decided to order takeout after work. They offer contactless takeout. I ordered the pad kee mao with beef. It also came with a decent amount of vegetables such as cauliflower, kale and carrots. The noodles were cooked to perfection. Not soggy at all. The spiciness made it the perfect dish. Definitely would order again. I am very excited to try their other dishes."
5,"Our party of 8 dined here for dinner after we saw &quot;Hamilton&quot; across the street at the Forrest Theater.  We had made reservations, which was a good idea, though they were actually able to seat us early.

The restaurant itself was chic and cool with Thai/Asian influence throughout. It seemed clean and nicely maintained.  Full bar downstairs.  Single-stall restrooms available.

Service was excellent -- very attentive and friendly.  

Food was prepared fresh and served hot.  We shared some appetizers, including the Sexy Fingers, Asian Dumplings, Chicken Satay, and Somosas.  Everything was full of flavor, as can be expected from quality Thai food!

Most of us ordered variations of the Drunken Noodle, including me.  One person asked for it less spicy, and they happily obliged.  Everyone enjoyed their dishes immensely!  Many of us also got drinks.  I liked my Coconut Horchata Rumtini -- so yummy!

I would welcome the opportunity to dine here again!"
4,"Great flavors but not too traditional for Thai food. The yellow curry was a delight, the potatoes in it were deep fried and added yet another layer of complexity to the dish. 

The appetizers were a let down. The duck tacos came out as these massive two tacos. We were surprised with the description that had been given on the menu. We were anticipating something much more delicate but it was large pieces of duck, red onion, and avocado. The taste was good but too much of the dish. We also got sexy fingers. They weren&apos;t anything special."
5,"Still One of the Best, Still One of My Favorites

It&apos;s been quite a while since I had been to Xiandu for no particular reason that we&apos;ve been so busy so when we do have time to ourselves we get too lazy to go out. 

And it&apos;s been a big regret of mine. Everything is just as I remembered, and I finally ran into Brian again (a server mentioned in my previous review) who is still the very best I&apos;ve ever had (I mean you never forget those). 

Service is still top notch (thanks for still remembering me, it makes me feel so at home when I visit!). And the happy hour is still great. 

There are a lot of great specials throughout the week, along with some specials if a show is open across the street at The Forrest Theater. I recommend almost everything on the menu. It&apos;s all so good and the drinks are well made (and strong). My only wish? If I could visit at least once a month."
