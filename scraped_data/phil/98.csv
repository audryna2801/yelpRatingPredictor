5,"Food: AMAZING, what a delicious surprise to find a New Mexican food joint with some some difference in traditional flavor and style. I loved the brunch options but it lacked in variation, it seemed as if it was just a small change to huevos rancheros. I was going to go for the breakfast burrito, but the other burrito options just sounded so much better... my gf got the scrambled eggs with chorizo, I thought it would be mediocre at best but the flavor was so delicious and welcoming, I immediately regretted not getting it, but when my chicken burrito came out... it was massive, I said to myself.. there I go again... eating with my eyes! Without a doubt though I did finish like 98% of it, ONLY because it was so delicious! And the cherry on top was the CHURROSSSS!! I would go back just for the churros and coffee, call it a day, cuz they were that good. 
Decor: beautiful, traditional, comfortable and welcoming, cafe bar was up in the front, food service was brought in from the back. Seating was comfortable, def big enough for big groups. 
Service: really on-top of things, I don&apos;t want to say &quot;due to the corona virus&quot; but it may have been it. Regardless they were attentive and very clean and fast! 
Drinks: Only because I have to mention the cafe con chocolate!  I was craving chocolate and here I was thinking to give the Oaxaca chocolate a try... but wow the cafe con chocolate was AMAZING! I beg you to order it if u read this go! Go now!!"
5,Found this place during a work trip to Philly. Great coffee and really friendly management. The cafe con leche was awesome and they are doing take out during COVID-19. Local place that really deserves your business!
5,"I love burritos. I cant remember if I&apos;ve ever had a really BAD burrito anywhere, but I always remember when I have a really GOOD burrito. Cafe y Chocolate is ALWAYS really good. Really good. Very friendly, fast delivery, and delicious every time."
5,"Ordered brunch this weekend after having seen Cafe y Chocolate on a list of best brunches in Philly. Order came quickly, drinks were in a carrier (awesome), everything was still warm! 

Food was outstanding! I ordered the molletes w/chorizo and scrambled eggs. HUGE portion. Seriously. I think I&apos;ve eaten less than half of it in two days. My partner got the huevos revueltos with chorizo - essentially scrambled eggs with chorizo and a side of black beans. Which... was kind of like a make-your-own version of my molletes! Ha. But also seriously good! 

Drinks were also great - $5 for a delicious berry smoothie? Yes, please! And I had to go with the cafe y chocolate... which was outstanding. 

One MINOR point: it was very unclear what kind of milks they offer... on the website it says coconut, soy, almond, whole. When ordering we had different options for the smoothie (soy or whole) and the cafe (soy, almond, whole) - I ordered almond, but it came labeled &quot;soy&quot;. So... would be nice to have those options clarified. I would have gone with coconut if possible! 

They menu is EXTENSIVE, prices are great, we will be back to order dinner some night - and any time I&apos;m craving chilequiles!"
5,"This is hands down my new favorite Mexican restaurant in Philly! Everything we had here was so good. 

- Tortas: bread was perfectly toasted - good balance of fluffy/chewy with a bit of crunch on the outside! The meat was so juicy and flavorful, and it paired really well with the avocado and onion. Super fresh and very filling! Probably my favorite part of the meal :)
- Horchata: a bit sweet for my taste but I&apos;ve also never had this drink before 
- Churros de Cajeta: this was so good!! The churro with the homemade chocolate dipping sauce was excellent and surprisingly light! I wish there had been more caramel in the center though. But would definitely go back for just the churros and chocolate alone 

The servers were very friendly and welcoming and the outdoor seating was shady and comfortable! They have limited indoor seating too."
5,"I found Cafe y Chocolate on a list of Latin restaurants this morning after watching a segment on the news. I was excited to hear that Philly planned a Latin Restaurant Week from September 30th until October 4th. I immediately jumped online to find places I would visit. 

Cafe y Chocolate made the list, so I decided to stop by on my way to work. I arrived to find a small place tucked in between some our buildings. There was a nice white, black, and yellow sign with the name of the establishment. Upon entering, I was greeted by a warm woman who asked if I needed a menu? I saw one posted in front of the coffee machinery. She also asked if I was interested in food or drinks. I told her I would like to try both. I looked over the menu and found so much I wanted to try, but I knew I wouldn&apos;t be able to eat everything I wanted, so I went with the Bistec tacos, caramel churros, a limonada, and latte. 

The wait time wasn&apos;t bad. I had my food in 15 mins. I got back to my car and immediately tried the churros. Maaaaaaan, when I tell you these were some of the best churros I ever had, I mean it! They were soft, light, creamy and savory. The caramel oozed from the churro with each bite. It was hard not to finish all 6. I had to stop so I could try my tacos. I opened the container to find 3 beautifully decorations tacos. They were completely full of ingredients. The steak, guacamole, onions, cheese, were amazing! I made a little song while taking each bite. I could only eat 2 bc I was so full. The last taco will be devoured tonight. I will say, the freshness of the tacos and the flavors of the ingredients were some of the best I had ever tasted. 

Cafe y Chocolate set the bar high for the other places on my list this week. I hope the other places are just as good."
4,"Delicious chicken tinga burrito. Chicken is tender, good flavor. If you want more heat, you can put more chipotle that comes with it.

Plantain is hard and not sweet, which I assume it&apos;s from unripe plantain. I prefer sweet and caramelized plantain. It&apos;s a pass from me.

Churros is fresh. I ordered the one with caramel fillings but didn&apos;t notice it at all. It comes with chocolate dipping. The dipping is more like chocolate drink instead of melted chocolate. Definitely recommend this"
4,"My husband and went for brunch last weekend while we were visiting Philly. Nice cozy spot. The café con chocolate was delicious. The churros were warm and really good. The food was ok..we expected a lot more flavor since the place seems pretty authentic. My husband had huevo rancheros and I had flautas de tinga. Would definitely return for the Cafe con chocolate and the great customer service. 
Tip: make sure to take cash. Tips are cash only."
4,"I&apos;m always on the lookout for breakfast spots that are open on weekdays and have good wifi. Café y Chocolate checks all the boxes!

The menu is pretty extensive and I love that there are plenty of options for everyone, regardless of diet or food preferences. 

I opted for a scramble with tomatoes, onions and peppers, which came with a side of black beans and some corn tortillas. My dining companion and I decided to add sides of guac for three bucks each. The portion was generous and we probably could have shared one side.  

The coffee was flowing and the next thing I knew it was almost lunch time. I ordered a salad with shrimp to go, dressing on the side. The salad was a little soggy about an hour later but the ingredients were fresh and plentiful. I&apos;ll probably stick to dining strictly in the restaurant for future meals but I&apos;m glad to have another solid breakfast or lunch spot to add to my rotation!"
5,"NommingNomad Approved!

This is a charming lil cafe in south philly with an amazing Mexican hot chocolate! It was the one of the best cups of hot chocolate I&apos;ve ever had. I&apos;m going to have to go back to get somE breakfast. Their menu looked really good!"
5,"Love this place I try and come here as often as I can . Small restaurant and you can feel the love everyone has for their jobs and it makes me feel like I&apos;m at home eating with friends ! 

Try the pineapple carrot juice and the Churros"
5,I love the food from here!!! It&apos;s right near my house and the staff is so friendly. Wish I could give more stars!!
2,"Ordered lunch from here was left feeling unfulfilled. We ordered an empanada de picadillo (beef), steak nachos l, and cajeta churros. As actually never received our empanada and instead we&apos;re given a beef huarache. Was all the way back to our hotel when we found out so it was too late to do anything about it. The huarache was disappointing. It was more like a large taco. The huarache did not have any thickness to it. The beef seasoning and flavored was just off and I was off out by the peas and carrots cooked in the meat. The steak nachos were more like nachos with steak fajitas on top of them which consisted of a ton of bell peppers. Had we wanted fajitas we would have ordered them. The churros were good but considering we got the cajeta ones we would have expected more cajeta to be included. They did include a tiny cup of hot chocolate for dipping which I thought to be creative and cute. Overall this meal was average and all the flavors are just a bit off to make you not want to order that item again. Not likely I&apos;d recommend but might return for a hot chocolate on a cold day."
4,"Cute little brunch spot in South Philly. The Mexican coffee (Cafe con chocolate) is a must! There&apos;s an extensive brunch menu and I&apos;m partial to the chorizo, eggs and black beans (it has a name, but it&apos;s escaping me). You really can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu, as it&apos;s all delicious. 

My only complaint would be that the tables are so close together. I&apos;d say if you have a party of more than 5, then expect to sit on top of your neighbor. Great spot for 2 people though. I can&apos;t wait to come back!"
5,"This place is great! So to start...On the way there for some reasons my Waze app took me to a different location up the street. I switched to Apple Maps and it got me here (this was the one time they are better than waze lol). We didn&apos;t see the restaurant initially because there isn&apos;t large signage or anything.

Anyway went in and it&apos;s sort of small inside, but they make good use of the tight space. They played salsa music the whole time so I was all in with the music selection. I ordered a cafe ole, fresh squeezed OJ, and the bistec tacos. My boyfriend ordered the huevos rancheros special with pork steak.

My cafe ole was great! It didn&apos;t come with sugar in it. So, if you like your coffee sweet make sure to ask for sugar. I was fine without. Also, the OJ was very refreshing. Now for the star of the show...tacos!!!! My bistec tacos were juicy, tender, and delicious!!! I really enjoyed the peppers and avocado they put on the tacos! Usually my tacos just come with onion and lime. I love a traditional taco without all the extra stuff on it, but this thang rightchea was so good! It was also extremely filling. Judging by the way my boyfriend devoured his food, he enjoyed his meal as well. 

The service was also really good. Our server was super nice and did a great job explaining all the specials. 

We will definitely be returning!"
5,This review is long overdue. I got brunch here last year and ordered a breakfast burrito and churros. The food was authentic and tasted amazing. The store was lined with decorations and made you feel cozy- like you were eating in someone&apos;s home.
5,"100% recommend!! My boyfriend and I visited Philadelphia from California to watch an Eagles game. We decided to stop by this restaurant before heading over to the game. 

Ambiance: This restaurant is a bit tight, and there was a wait to be seated. This place had a cozy, family feel to it, which I loved. 

Service: The main person in charge did a good job of navigating the crowd waiting to be seated. We asked him if we could sit at a small bar area by the stairs since we were in a rush to get to the game. He was so understanding and made sure to get our orders placed so we wouldn&apos;t have to wait long once we were seated. We got seated shortly after, and our food came out immediately. I think he definitely placed a sense of urgency on his kitchen staff, which was sooo greatly appreciated! 

Food: I had the cafe Oaxaca and it was so delicious!!! I had the huevos rancheros and my boyfriend got the chorizo plate. Both were great! 

Food was great, service was great, the coffee was AMAZING! I definitely understand why there was a wait to eat here. 
If we&apos;re ever back in Philadelphia, I&apos;d definitely come here again. If I lived in a Philadelphia, I&apos;d be here at least once a month! Highly recommend. :)

Side note: I&apos;m half Mexican and really appreciated the authenticity of this restaurant decor, food, and drinks. We have a lot of Mexican food in California, so it was nice to have this experience on the other side of the country."
3,"The catch here is that you think it&apos;s a cheap eat, but it&apos;s really a cheap vegetarian eat. The second you add meat to any item, the price is the same as anywhere else you&apos;d go really.

Anyway, we got the molletes with chorizo and enchiladas with chicken. Molletes were SOOO good, highly recommend it! And pairs so well with chorizo! I&apos;d give them a 5/5 for sure. The enchiladas were just OK, nothing crazy, but good mole sauce! 

I was really looking forward to the tres leches cake but unfortunately was highly disappointed. The cake itself was kind of dense and dry on the inside with some milk over it, not very moist and soft on the inside like you&apos;d hope. I wanted to like it so bad and hoped I just got a bad piece that I tried it again on a second visit where I enjoyed those molletes again, but was also again disappointed by the cake. Oh well!"
5,"Really amazing little spot ! Authentic mexican food at its finest. Great brunch options!
I cant help but ALWAYS order the Cafe Con Chocolate (2 shots of espresso with mexican hot chocolate) It&apos;s out of this WORLD!!!!
Also highly recommend the nachos. The refried beans are crazy good. 
Sundays are really really busy, so i recommend trying to come in on a week day."
4,"It had been months since my girlfriend and I indulged in Sunday brunch so when the time came to bring it back to life, we chose Café y Chocolate. I&apos;ve been reading some bomb reviews and was really curious about the hype. 

We walked in at about 12:30pm and got the last available table. Our waitress was sweet but a bit pushy. She asking us if we were ready to place our order every few minutes and this happened three times. She was really nice about it though so I took it as a sign that she was just excited to serve us. 

After asking a couple questions, we were ready to order. I got the scrambled tofu, my friend had the chicken tinga empanadas, and we got an order of churros to share. We had the option of ordering plain churros or ones with caramel filling and decided to go all in and get the ones with caramel. 

The scrambled tofu that I got was great. There was nothing special about it, but it was made well and was very filling. I was given a side of tortillas to create my own soft shell tacos which I enjoyed. My friend seemed to really like her entree and commented about how great the chicken tinga was. 

The churros are what stood out the most though. They were absolutely amazing. They were warm, coated with cinnamon sugar, and had the most delicious caramel filling. They came with a homemade chocolate dipping sauce which I honestly didn&apos;t care much for. I was totally fine with the churros without the chocolate. They also came with fresh slices of strawberries and whipped cream on the side - I really liked that! No matter what you do, GET THE CHURROS. At only $4 for an order of six, you really can&apos;t go wrong. 

My only complaint is that all of their entrees are savory, there are no sweet options. Of course there&apos;s the churros, but that isn&apos;t an entree. I would have loved to see some pancakes or waffles on the menu with some kind of Mexican twist. 

Still, Café y Chocolate is a good option for brunch. I definitely want to try one of their hot beverages like a coffee or hot chocolate next time I visit. And lastly, my hope is that they&apos;ll have some sweet brunch options on the menu next time."
