5,"We ordered Christmas dinner from Miles Table and not only was the food phenomenal, but the ordering process was seamless. 

Alysia was super friendly and helpful when I called to place my order and once it arrived within our 2-hour delivery window, she sent a follow-up email detailing how to heat everything up. It couldn&apos;t have been any easier.

The food was amazing - we loved everything from the potato leek soup to the braised short ribs and roasted veggies. The bourbon pumpkin pie was delish and our parents thought so too since we shared half of it with them.

I had never dined at Miles Table pre-pandemic, but once things open back up, I certainly plan on doing so. Until then, I highly recommend online ordering or catering."
5,Was blown away by the delicious food at this establishment and am disappointed that I only just discovered it. Had a wonderful omelette and some of the most delicious bacon that I ever had. Outdoor seating was welcome during COVID which was nice. Our food was served promptly and the portion was very ample! My only regret they were out of skim milk so I couldn&apos;t have my usual skim latte but went with a diet coke which did the trick.
5,"Miles Table is a cute little Caf√© that does takeout, curbside pickup, and outdoor dining. We took our seats outside and embarked on our brunch adventure. 

Most of us chose the breakfast side of brunch, but one of our friends went rogue and ate lunch. 

I went with the eggs any style and a side of turkey sausage. Everything tasted fresh; the highlight of this meal was the home fries! They were perfectly seasoned and crunchy, with just the perfect amount of spice. The turkey sausage tasted amazing as well. 

My friends got the avocado toast and the breakfast sandwich. They were not ready for the portions Miles Table dished out! You&apos;ll most likely be taking some of it to go. It was delicious nevertheless. 

My friend said his Thai chicken sandwich was great too. The food was on point and our waiter was very attentive. He came around regularly to make sure we were okay. 

To end our experience, the bill was more than affordable. I paid for two dishes that came out to just a little more than 20 bucks. It was definitely a happy swipe of my card. 

Miles Table was a win!"
4,"Due to Covid there is only outdoor seating or take out. Surrounding area is very nice and quiet that early in the morning (my boyfriend and I were there at 9 am). 

My Avocado BLT was very filling and flavorful, unfortunately the bacon was extremely hard and didn&apos;t taste fresh. The kettle chips were okay, nothing really to write home about. The blood orange San Pellegrino I had to drink paired nicely with it. My boyfriend got the Red Velvet waffle that was mediocre, the waffle didn&apos;t taste red velvet and the icing tasted like melted cream cheese and not a cream cheese icing. Kinda pricey over all, two meals, one ice coffee and one San Pellegrino for $27. I recommend for brunch for sure, not too sure for their breakfast."
5,"What a lovely store!! The staff were extremely friendly today and I enjoyed their throwback tunes. 

I got the fruit cup and a breakfast burrito. Both delicious and fresh!

There&apos;s outdoor seating. Available on doordash."
4,"I&apos;ve been a fan of Miles Table since they first opened. Their menu is a mix of brunch staples and some sandwiches and salads. If you dine-in, they often have a lineup of interesting specials. I&apos;ve always had great experiences with their friendly staff, as well. 

I&apos;ve also ordered delivery on multiple occasions. Their delivery is always really fast and I&apos;ve never had any issues with accuracy for my orders. 

My go-tos are the build-your-own omelet, vegetable avocado wrap, turkey club and avocado blt (preferably on a wrap). Their chipotle sauce is amazing and I would eat it on anything. I have noticed that they can be a little heavy handed with onions on sandwiches and salads; my recent vegetable avocado wrap was a bit overpowered by them. Definitely something I&apos;ll want to remember when placing my order in the future. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s only a matter of time! 

Thanks for feeding the neighborhood, Miles Table!"
5,"Thank you yelp for this awesome find while searching for breakfast places near me on this Sunday morning! 

Miles Table is a cute little breakfast shop on south street with super reasonable prices. My boyfriend and I both got the breakfast sandwiches, coffees, and an order of the breakfast potatoes. This was more than enough food for the both of us and only came to around $22! The breakfast sandwich was really big and was served on ciabatta rolls, which are my favorite. We both ended up having to take togo boxes (although I unfortunately dropped mine on the walk home). 

The ordering process here was super simple and then you just bring your number to a table. Despite this place being a little small, we had no trouble finding a place to eat. Service was extremely quick and they did a great job with clearing tables.

I saw they also have awesome breakfast specials during the week from 8-10 like all you can eat pancakes for $6 and a breakfast sandwich with coffee for $5. 

We will definitely be back to try some of the breakfast specials and more of the menu!"
5,"BRUNCH!! Came here last Sunday and it was an awesome surprise that it wasn&apos;t packed... probably due to everyone quarantining themselves but hey more for me. My gf and I ordered the carnitas Benedict and short rib grilled cheese... we split the tres leches French toast. And it was absolutely amazing. Every bite of each dish was just phenomenal. Just a minor addition of some hot sauce and C&apos;est Magnifique . 
Service was great!! Food came out quick, and they maintained the clean atmosphere to not steer any people away. 
Place was big enough for bigger groups but of course it t&apos;was just the two of us. 
Definitely will be coming back soon!"
3,"Since moving to the neighborhood, we had passed Miles Table so many times and were looking forward to trying it. I&apos;m torn with my rating.  We just didn&apos;t have a great experience with our food as every other Yelper to merit a 4-star. 

I ordered the Avocado Toast, which is accompanied by potatoes.  The eggs were not over easy (as my picture shows) and the potatoes were overly salty.  My husband ordered one of the specials and it also failed to deliver a solid punch in taste or flavor.  

The service and the employees were super friendly and we will give this place another try in the future, since we live so close."
4,"I met Michelle C for coffee and breakfast at Miles Table on a cold winter morning and I really liked it! The cafe has a very comfy, causal feel to it making it the perfect spot for us to meet and get some work done. 

We both ordered omelets with just slight variations in our three add-ons. I asked for onions, mushrooms, and provolone on mine which are staple omelet choices for me. It was very simple but delicious and huge! I enjoyed the whole grain toast and potatoes it came with and was happy sipping on my hot coffee between bites. 

I don&apos;t live on South otherwise I&apos;m sure this would become my go-to breakfast joint. For now, it will be a good meet-up for both of us!"
3,"I got pickup from Miles Table on a Saturday morning and didn&apos;t realize there were a few issues with my order until I got home and unpacked my bag 20 minutes later.

I ordered the Tres Leches French Toast (which came with strawberries and bananas, as well as a side of syrup and whipped cream) which was absolutely delicious. This was the highlight of my order! I ate 1/3 of it right then and saved the rest for later.

I ordered the Breakfast Sandwich with egg (over medium), cheese (cheddar), and avocado on a brioche roll. When I unwrapped the sandwich, I saw that it had bacon on it (I&apos;m a vegetarian). It also didn&apos;t have the lettuce or tomato on it. I had my own arugula and tomato at home and added some. The sandwich was pretty good, but the mixup was unfortunate. I knew the sandwich wouldn&apos;t do well being re-heated, so I ate the whole thing then.

I also got a side of home fries. I knew these would re-heat pretty easily, so I saved those to eat later alongside the remainder of the french toast. The home fries were tasty and a great texture.

I definitely would have given 4 stars had it not been for the bacon incident. I&apos;m happy to give them another chance in the future and try some of the other menu items (eyes are on the divorced eggs)."
4,"I have been here a couple of times. Once for lunch and once for brunch. You typically walk up to the counter, order your food, and grab an open seat. They have a decent sized menu with a bunch of specials at any given time. The food comes out quickly and the place is without frills.

Lunch: I have had the Brisket Grilled Cheese, Thai Chicken Sandwich and fries. Both entrees were large and neither of us could finished it in one sitting. The Thai Chicken Sandwich was much better than the grilled cheese however. The brisket was on the dry side, and even with the cheese, the sandwich needed a sauce of some sorts, either from the brisket drippings or a fresh made sauce.

Breakfast: I have had the Tres Leches French Toast, Chicken and Waffles, an omelette and home fries. The French toast was pretty good and the waffles hit the spot. The omelette was ok, but it was cooked well.

Overall
Thai Chicken Sandwich 4/5
Brisket Grilled Cheese 2/4
Tres Leches French Toast 4/5
Chicken and Waffles 4/5
Fries 4/5
Omelette 3/5"
5,"We&apos;ve been coming to Miles Table for a little bit now, but this is my first time reviewing it. 

This place is great, hands down. It&apos;s a small little spot on South St. that gets a bit busy sometimes. You have to order and pay at the counter and seat yourself. We have run into a line a few times, so plan your schedule accordingly. 

My wife got the omelette with the breakfast potatoes and I got one of their specials, the Pumpkin Spice Waffle and a side of the breakfast potatoes. Both dishes were excellent! Potatoes came with a nice chipotle aioli sauce for dipping! 

Nice atmosphere here with plenty of specials! Check this place out if you have a chance, you won&apos;t be disappointed. Easily one of our go to spots!"
3,"Met a friend here for a breakfast, the location initially made me nervous thinking about the parking situation on South Street. Well this Sunday I was in luck I found and parked approximately 20 feet from the restaurant. My friend who arrived about 15 minutes later was almost as lucky, less than a block away. Let&apos;s start with the entrance, the steps are very high with no railing for those who may need &apos;assistance&apos; this could be problematic.  Additionally I did not see a method a person who requires wheelchair access could enter. But they absolutely need a railing at the minimum.  Once inside the place was nice and neat with plenty of tables and chairs, they can accommodate small or larger parties (about 10 in group). I prefer table service but it wasn&apos;t an option. While at the counter I went over the menu and stated to the staff &apos;hum so many choices&apos;, no response just a smile. So I went with my gut. 

My pumpkin spice waffle was delivered to my table very timely. With that being said it was room temperature and soft although I asked for a firm waffle. I really dislike spongy waffles especially if they&apos;re not hot. Once you add syrup the waffle becomes soggy or mushy, ugh....However the roasted sweet potatoes were good, the candied pecans delicious but I must say the whipped cream was fresh and flavorful just outstanding! The coffee was okay nothing to write home about and nothing to make me return. The restaurant only had three other guest and several delivery or pick up orders. No reason not to serve hot food!"
5,"Now offering curbside pickup during the time of coronavirus. Go check them out and support your local businesses!

Lots of specials on their website and a great web interface for ordering food (its like like any other shopping site). Food was ready in 20min. You call when you get to the door so you don&apos;t have to go inside and someone brings out the food. Coffee was made fresh when we got there so it was still hot. 

We got the burrito and the tres leches french toast. Burrito was hefty and came with cotija cheese, pickled onions and jalapenos and DELICIOUS salsa/hot sauce. Nice and smokey but not so spicy that you can&apos;t add any. We had the potato chorizo which was excellent too - nice and flavorful. French toast came with lots of fruits which was nice. Whipped cream and syrup on the side and it was just perfect. 

Whole thing only came to 28 bucks which was very reasonable - we were stuffed and the food excellent! I&apos;m usually skeptical about brunch but these guys did it right. Go check em out for sure!"
4,"I&apos;m so happy that I stopped by this cute restaurant last week for lunch. Most of the food is simple, but so great! I totally recommend coming here. I got an omelette and it was so fresh and delicious. They also have a nice seating area that is roped off from the street. I will definitely be returning soon!"
4,"Miles Table is a great place to go for a casual weekend brunch in the city when you don&apos;t feel like waiting forever or dealing with the hassle of making reservations. You order and pay at the counter, then grab a table, and wait for them to bring  out your food. It&apos;s a small space, so keep that in mind. I went with a group of 4 a little before 11am on a Sunday and had no issues, but it did start getting busier once we were ready to leave. The menu is pretty standard with great variety. I got the Miles salad with avocado which was delicious and refreshing. The portions are pretty large too and everytjing is decently priced."
5,"They have handled the Covid situation well--coming in from out of town, we were unaware that there would be no indoor seating, but we were still able to enjoy our meal in our car (we have a baby) while others chose to sit outside on this cool day. We ordered the miles burger and the divorced eggs with guacamole--the burger was a 4/5, with good flavor, a bun that was a bit oversized, and good sauce. If the bun were better, the rating would be higher. The divorced eggs were eggcellent.  The perfect combo of texture, flavor, temperature. Overall 5/5! Would return."
5,"Fantastic breakfast! Small place down the street from my hotel and it did not disappoint. Very friendly staff and the food did not disappoint. Service was also fast, waited maybe 10 minutes for the food. A must go if in the area. The tress leche French toast was nothing short of 5 stars."
5,"OMG, Miles Table was truly something else. The menu is extensive, I was overwhelmed with the choices. Everything I&apos;ve tried here was flavorful. The crew was very welcoming and service is exceptional. Yes, Miles Table actually care that you are happy."
