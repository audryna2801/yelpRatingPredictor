5,"It&apos;s a bit pricey, but everything was delicious.  The zucchini cakes were really good, but it comes with 2 tiny rounds.  I would think for $13, they would be made of crab, but flavor profile was spot on.  My pic makes it look bigger, but that&apos;s a pretty small sauce container next to it.

The lamb shank was a slam dunk winner.  My chicken skewer was perfect for me and I really enjoyed the tzatziki and the salad.  It really filled me up.  

Prepare yourself for the tab.  I had pulled the take out menu off their website and the lamb was supposed to be $38, but rang up $42, so that was surprise #1.  They also tack on 10% service fee that is also taxed.  Then you have the standard sales tax, so know that it&apos;s basically an additional 20% on top of your subtotal.  The printed receipt will also ask for additional gratuity.  

So if you can stomach the prices (they had a $50 seabass and a $60 steak too) for take out, then it&apos;s worth a try.  Despite the appetizer sizes, it was a filling and very satisfying meal.  Tip: Make sure you call in advance for take out as they do schedule those with specific time slots.  So you can&apos;t just order and expect food to be ready in 15-20 minutes."
5,"This review is for take-out only given COVID-19.

I&apos;ve reviewed Kokkari before but wanted to drop thoughts on the take-out experience and provide an account of the positive pick-up experiences to hopefully encourage more folks to support this great restaurant! They were always packed pre-COVID, and many times the only available reservation was 9/9:30pm or later.

Overall: 4.5/5
Food: 4.75/5
Value: 4.5/5
Pick-up experience: 5/5

Have long been regulars and love ordering several of their dishes for take-out, including the lamb riblets, Greek salad, avgolemeno, kataifi and more. 

The Greek salad has a great acidity from the dressing mixed with creamy feta cheese, olives, and chopped tomatoes and cucumbers. Hands down my favorite salad ever.

Avgolemeno, the lemon chicken soup, is incredible - a smooth, creamy texture but not heavy, with some acidic notes from the lemon. 

Lamb riblets are so classic - melt in your mouth tasty and well seasoned. Grilled lamb chops are also well cooked and a sizable portion. 

Price wise it&apos;s on the higher side but the portion sizes and food quality make up for it in my opinion.

Packaged well for a good take-out experience. Super easy pick-up experience, with a representative donning proper PPE meeting you by the curb and doing an easy hand-off of your order. 

Highly recommend Kokkari and supporting them by ordering take-out in these difficult times for restaurants!"
5,"WOW. Gorgeous space. Immaculate service. I didn&apos;t feel rushed nor did I have to wait too long for anything. Impeccable timing. Seamless. I wish every dining experience was this perfect. The food was also incredible. 
We had the crispy smelts with skordalia (a must try skordalia is so tasty). 
Persimmon salad - super fresh and delicious. 
Brussels sprouts - not a stand out dish to me bc I eat these all the time, they were roasted perfectly. 
For entrees the lamb chops and roasted chicken. The skin falling right off the chicken was some of the best I&apos;ve ever had. 
Drink recommendations and pairings were also perfect with our food. 
Sundae and espressos for dessert. The sundae is massive and sooooo bomb. 
Highly recommend. Will be ordering takeout in the future due to the soon to be indoor shut down. Support local businesses!!! This place is a MUST."
5,"Upscale spot in the FiDi. On the pricier side. That being said, its one of the best restaurants in the area and the food is absolutely delicious. 

The greek salad is one of the best I&apos;ve had. Seems ordinary from the description but something about their feta cheese, olives and dressing sets it apart.

Their grilled lamb chops are delicious. Perfectly cooked and pretty decent portion. If I had to be super picky I would say it was a tad dry, but very close to perfect. 

My friend raved about the grilled octopus app and highly recommended it. He got the branzino de-boned and enjoyed it. Super tasty, but did have a couple smaller bones.

Overall, one of the best high-end spots in SF!"
5,"Surprised my girlfriend with this place as our 2 year anniversary. It was absolutely fantastic!
The experience from when we entered to when we left at the end of the night was flawless. They had this wonderful pork-belly appetizer that was tender to the touch, whoever picked out such a fine cut and cooked it so well has my thanks. We also got the ravioli and the dry aged steak.
The steak had incredible complex flavors and was cooked exactly how i asked: well-done with ketchup.... jk it was incredibly tender, another great cut and cook. the ravioli was great but well.... steak =P
For dessert we got some ice cream and they wrote happy anniversary for us in chocolate to wrap up the night.
I definitely look forward to coming back!"
5,What a delightful dinner. Grilled octopus was superb. I had the whole grilled fish with greens and that was delicious. It was an extensive menu that made choosing our meal difficult.
5,"We had a memorable experience. Our server Helen was delightfully knowledgeable and attentive, and all the staff were personable and helpful. We have never had better octopus, and didn&apos;t realize how tender it could be. The goat stew was an aromatic comfort, and everyone was happy with their choices. We look forward to getting back to try more of their dishes!"
4,"Ordered their preset Valentine&apos;s menu and glad we did! Although, definitely will come back to order again to try their other dishes. For a couple who doesnt really celebrate Valentine&apos;s day, we just wanted a delicious dinner and try something we haven&apos;t had before and also to avoid crowds since outdoor dining is back and the fact that SF was back as a street festival. I believe a pandemic is still going on, but to each their own. But with that said, outdoor dining is not available at this location, at least for now, which we felt safer to pick up! As for the food, the meal, especially the appetizers were bursting with flavors. My favorite was their shredded filo Dungeness crab, with spring asparagus, leek, and feta. We actually tossed it in out air fryer to regain that warm crispness and so glad we did. The dips, which were tzatziki, caviar roe dip, and eggplant were amazing to eat with the spinach feta spanokopita, dolmas, and their fluffy buttery pita! I also enjoyed the fresh ingredients for the Greek salad, even though this is a traditional Greek salad, the veggies and ingredients were of high quality and super fresh and like no other basic Greek salad.  The bf chose the grilled lamb chops which were cooked to perfection at medium as requested and I chose the grilled salmon on a bed of flavorful lentils mixed with an artichoke tapenade. The salmon was okay, but surprisingly enjoyed the sauce on the lentils more. he Greek white wine we added to our order was def a great pairing to our meal as well!"
4,"I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Kokkari was open for takeout during SIP. We ordered our favorite grilled octopus, lamb riblets and the grilled lamb chops. All were amazing and as tasty as I remember when dining in person.  Specifically, no one does grilled octopus like Kokkari does. 

The order and pick up process was simple and effortless."
4,"Like the Yelp rating says: Yay! I&apos;m a fan.

My friend and I ordered the following:
- Grilled octopus with lemon, oregano, and olive oil 5/5
- Crispy zucchini cakes with cucumber and mint-yogurt dressing 4/5
- Special of the day: roasted duck 4/5
- Special of the day: pork belly 4/5
- Nettle and ricotta ravioli 3/5

Yes, I know... we did not order the traditional Greek dishes for our main entrees and I&apos;m pretty sure that&apos;s where we messed up. To be fair, the grilled octopus was BY FAR my favorite dish of the entire night. I kept talking about it during and after dinner. It was cooked to perfection! I would not change anything about that dish, except for it to be a bigger portion ;)

Side note: You have to take an elevator to get to the bathroom downstairs."
5,"Made a reservation for a Friday night and went there an hour early hoping to be seated sooner and they were nice enough to get us a table early. The service is one of the best I&apos;ve experienced. The right amount of friendly! 
- We started off with the Saghanakai and it&apos;s a treat to watch it sizzle and it tasted great with lemon squeezed on top and oregano. 
- Main course was Pan roasted halibut placed on a bed of black lentils and artichoke. Although I felt the fish was cold, it still tasted great. The black lentils were full of flavor! Another dish is the lamb chops and it was perfectly cooked (medium) and those potatoes were so good! 
- Dessert was baklava with ice-cream. 
Every dish was full of flavors, definitely going back to try other dishes in their menu!"
5,"This is the best restaurant in SF. This will be one of my future spots and I cannot wait to try the rest of the menu. 

Food: 5/5: 
Appetizers: I loved the Zucchini cakes, Duck dolmathes, and Pork belly (note: the pork belly is a bit fatty, but it&apos;s pork belly) 

Entree: Lamb chops solid, but next time i would try one their other amazing dishes. My gf really liked the Halibut.

Dessert: I loved the Baklava Ice cream, whereas, the gf loved the Galaktoboureko

Ambiance: 5/5: amazing Mediterranean atmosphere, Great upscale spot for have an intimate or fun dinner with friends

Service: 5/5: amazing service"
5,"Food here was amazing! I never actually like dolmathes, until I bite into the ones here. We ordered the regular vegetarian dolmathes, and for their special of the day, they had one dolmathes stuffed with lamb- which had amazing flavor! 

We ordered family-style, so everyone could try everything. The grilled lamb chops were by far the best main course item (get them medium rare). 

For desserts, all the ice cream here is made in house and is super creamy! The custard dessert (fifth one down the menu) and the donuts are the best. Service was great."
5,"*****
This is a ten star restaurant. I love everything here on the menu. My favorite is the chicken. I also love the whole fish selections and the pit is always a rotisserie de jour of the choicest lamb pork or beef.
This restaurant is always very busy so book in advance.  Try the chocolate torte for dessert along with the best Baclava in San Francisco."
5,"One of the best restaurants in SF! Everything we ordered was amazing! 

Octapodaki tou Yiorgou
Melitzanosalata, Tzatziki, Favasalata dip (MY FAVORITE!)

Entrees: We got a fish and chicken (sorry forgot the name, but picture is attached).

The dips were amazing. I honestly bet everything on the menu won&apos;t be a disappointment. Must go!"
4,"First off, I want to say that many people have suggested Kokkari to me and many claim it is their favorite restaurant in San Francisco, let alone their favorite Mediterranean restaurant. Amazing Mediterranean food, especially if you want to know more about Mediterranean cuisine beyond pita bread and hummus. But of course we got some of that as a starter because it&apos;s good! 

We also got the Saghanaki as a starter, which is like a pan-fried cheese with lemon and oregano on top. For our mains, we had the lamp chop and one of the grilled fish dishes, can&apos;t remember if it was the Ippoglossa or the Psari Psito. Had a bottle of red wine that the server selected based on our choices of the main dishes. Topped it off with a couple of desserts. Delicious.

The environment of the restaurant was great, lively with all the people filling up the place, but also it wasn&apos;t overly loud where we had to shout to hear each other. Would definitely come back to try other things on their menu, go and give them a try! Definitely make a reservation before going."
5,"Excellent, savory, delicious food, and absolutely delightful service. The birthday desserts year after year has gotten better and they&apos;re always so cordial."
5,"An outstanding Greek restaurant! Most of the items on the menu I can&apos;t pronounce but who cares, its all really good. 
I had the goat stew, so flavorful and not gamey at all, everyone at the table loved it. So glad I ordered the goat stew. 
The atmosphere in this restaurant is electric and has a great vibe to it, its just a great restaurant. I&apos;ve been to Greece and the food here is on par with authentic greek food, not a pretender at all. Authentic and tasty greek meals with an open hearth to roast meats."
5,"Kokkari delivers an outstanding dining experience every time. The menu is traditional Greek with the full range of flavors and some creative twists. The freshness of the ingredients and the creative range of spices they use really make their dishes unique in the landscape of Greek.  The octopus is one of our absolute favorite menu items as well as the succulent lamb chops. We have done takeout during Covid to recreate the Kokkari dining experience at home. Pickup is easy or if you can&apos;t bear to leave the house, you can schedule your order and delivery to your home in advance using UberEats.  But we miss their beautiful restaurant and can&apos;t wait until we can dine there in person again! Ps: On desserts - the rice pudding and the yogurt/honey are musts if you have room after all the other fantastic menu items."
5,"I love Kokkari.  

I love sitting at the bar.

I love every appetizer on the menu.

I love the branzino.

Never forget about the grilled octopus or grilled lamb.

Pro move when you don&apos;t have a reservation.  Catch the eye of the bartender when ordering drinks.  Ask him / her to save you a seat at the bar.  Waaay better than waiting for a table.  In my humble opinion better service at the bar.  Ask the bartender to recommend your apps and dinner.  Done!"
