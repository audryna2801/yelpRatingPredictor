5,"I&apos;m not really an ice cream person but my little neighbor friend insisted that we stop here 

Ok friend I got you 

We parked about a block down from the venue    There is parking behind the business however it was full  no worries

The line was literally around the corner but it went by fast 

There is signage on the side of the building letting you know what flavors they offer and the prices   That is helpful so you are prepared to order when it&apos;s your turn 

I initially ordered lychee flavor but was told it only comes in gallon sizes    Ummm it&apos;s not that serious for me so I settled in my go to Rocky Road 

Got one scoop of Rocky Road in a cup   

Ice cream was good  nice and velvety     

Definitely a must go to if you are an ice cream person 

Tons of flavors and options 

There is also an app to place your order and a separate line for people who place order on the app"
5,"This ice cream place is amazing!! I absolutely love their mango, Ube and sweet coconut; I have also tried their NY cherry (which is good but I don&apos;t care fo cherries); they to go half gallons are dangerous (whenever I go I end up picking up on lol for later since this place is far from home); I usually get a scoop with waffle cone topped with chocolate (it&apos;s delicious!) I have tried 2 scoops at a time and I can&apos;t finish it (its a lot but that&apos;s a good thing in this case!!)! 

Their social distancing during covid is good, their prices are on point and customer service is good too! Highly recommend this delicious ice cream! 

Warning: once you have this ice cream, no other place will feel good enough- because this place is the best! Truly :)"
5,"Saw posts of Mitchell&apos;s ice cream on Instagram and decided to order some ice cream online! The photos were super inviting. The pumpkin flavor that was featured in the photo was super relevant too (Halloween is just around the corner!)

Even though the delivery fee and service fee were sort of expensive, I feel like it would be less convenient for me to actually go to the store. But I don&apos;t want to miss out good flavors, so I ordered online anyway. 

The ice cream was super creamy (which I love). The pumpkin flavor was super rich and spicy. The taste of fall for sure. The rum raisin one was pretty good too. I thought it would be super rich, but it was actually quite fresh. The two together are definitely a good pair. Highly recommend these two flavors! 

Looking forward to trying out more flavors!!!"
4,"I like this place, I do! I really do! It&apos;s just hard to give it 5-stars when comparing it to Garden Creamery and Salt &amp; Straw. This place is yummy &amp; has tons of great flavors. Sometimes the portions aren&apos;t always given the same with each different visit, not sure if that has to with the pandemic.

I usually get the Thai Tea &amp; Ube flavors, both very flavorful &amp; concentrated. They have lots of Asian/ Filipino flavors, which I looove. They also sell other little candies &amp; snacks.

Warning, sometimes there is a short line so make sure to bundle up since this area is always freezing! But when the craving for ice cream calls, you just can&apos;t fight it."
5,"Next level ice cream. There is a reason why Mitchell&apos;s has been around for so long, the quality is just impeccable. I have always loved the praline, so much that I never ventured away from it. I hear the ube and young coconut flavors are good too, but I never deviate.

One night, I thought I&apos;d be adventurous and try the cookies and cream. I&apos;m always skeptical about ordering it at ice cream parlors, because I worry about the cookie to ice cream ratio. Ice cream aficionado right here! However...this was different. There were GOBS of oreos mixed into the vanilla ice cream. It was so satisfying I wanted to cry, and when it was gone I wanted to cry harder.

Mitchell&apos;s, thank you for always putting a smile on this girl&apos;s face :)"
5,"Perfect ice cream flavors!  I bought a pint of each flavors mango, ube, halo halo   and maxapuno..  the flavors of these are on point..I especially like the mango flavor hands down of what I had during my childhood years in the Philippines..my aunt will slice this nicely riped mangoes from my grandma&apos;s own mango trees ...mangoes that are actually been picked green and ripen by putting them on top of window sill in a row (yes it&apos;s the best way to ripen)..macapuno also takes me back to my childhood days ..wow!  I can not believe that I only got to taste their ice cream now..I&apos;ve been in SF bay area for over 30 yrs..Mitchell&apos;s ice cream have been in operation since 1953!  I need to go back and get their langka or Jackfruit flavor!  And for folks who does not live in SF bayarea ..you gotta go and check them out!  The lines may  be crazy but it is so worth it!  If you&apos;re in a hurry , sometimes it is better to call ahead and you can get to the express line!"
5,"The weather is so cold but I can&apos;t get off without having an ice cream. There are a lot of flavors to choose from, can&apos;t wait to taste them all.. What a great experience at Mitchell&apos;s Ice Cream! Love it!

They have a flavor called grasshopper pie that I think is a mix of cookies n cream and mint chip (maybe something else like a fudge swirl) that is awesome, and my go-to for take home half gallons.

The wait can get a little outrageous, and there&apos;s no way to order ahead, but the wait is always worth it, and the line moves pretty quickly.

If you just want a pre-packed half gallon, you can skip the line."
5,"Mitchell&apos;s brings back memories of high school, college, dates, late nights, being young. It&apos;s traditional and old fashioned, but they keep the flavors interesting. 

In normal times, the lines can be brutal, but at the same time, you get to hang out and watch the neighborhood scenes. And the ice cream and milkshakes are worth the wait. I look forward to bringing my kids their for treats."
4,"Mitchell&apos;s is a staple when in Sf! Because of social distancing, they have not allowed anyone to be in the actual store and you have to order right at the door. 

They are fast and efficient despite the long lines. I ordered the grasshopper pie flavor and it was tasty. The woman taking my order was a little curt and rude when I was asking for clarification about certain flavors. The one scoop is a little small for the price, but it was okay because I didn&apos;t want that much ice cream anyway. It was a nice little ice cream experience and I enjoyed it."
5,"Since the shelter-in-place orders were initiated in March, I&apos;ve driven into San Francisco exactly 2 times.  But I found myself eating dinner nearby, so I felt compelled to drop by Mitchells to pick up 2 half-gallons, since I didn&apos;t know when I would be in the neighborhood again.  (Green tea for myself and macapuno for my mother).

To comply with the COVID regulations, customers are no longer allowed inside the shop.  Instead, the staff have set up 2 lines.  The line on the left is for regular orders.  The line on the right is the express lane, to pick up online orders (or for delivery drivers) or to order pre-packed ice cream.  At 7:30 PM on a Friday night, the regular line was at least 10 parties deep, but the express line only had 2 parties queued up.  I was in and out of line in less than 10 minutes.

Masks are required for customers and staff, and there are 6-feet markers on the ground in the 2 lines.  While the 2 lanes converge at the front door, there is a wood and plexiglass barrier in between the 2 lanes.  Along the express lane, there were laminated menus posted with the current flavors, so you can decide what to order before getting to the front."
5,"When I come out to SF it&apos;s always a necessity to get ice cream! Yes you read that right!!! I saw how popular this place was and figured to give it a try. 
My husband and I arrived and we struggled to find parking because they only have street parking. After sometime we finally found a spot and went in line. 

It was a bit packed at first but the line went by fairly quickly. They had the menu out on the wall so it made it easier to figure out what we wanted to order. I knew I had to get a double scoop because WHY NOT. 

They had many flavors to choose from and I ended up ordering banana and ube Ice cream. My husband got the pistachio and coffee flavors. We both did double scoop on a waffle cone. 

We were able to enter the actual shop but it is a small one with no indoor or outdoor seating. So we just sat in our car and enjoyed our ice cream since it was dark and in that location no where really to walk and enjoy any scenic views. 

I liked my choice of flavors but realized the ube ice cream tasted differently from another ones I&apos;ve had at different shops. My husband also enjoyed his flavors. It was very creamy and not too sweet. The potion size is just generous so you&apos;ll be satisfied. Even one scoop was enough for me because I was struggling to finish it but I just had to get two flavors."
5,"My childhood favorite!! What would I do without you?!? You&apos;ve been with me through thick and thin, literally!!  I&apos;m grateful that you&apos;re still here Mitchell&apos;s because now my kids have fond memories of you too. Thank you for all your flavors and your creamy goodness that makes a rainy day seem like a walk in the clouds on my way to heaven every time!!"
5,"I know, I know, the line! Look, if you see a line, it&apos;s ok! Just get in there, check the flavors they have posted along the wall and you&apos;ll be at the front in no time- line goes fast! 

When it&apos;s 68 degrees in SF, it feels like it&apos;s 90 and it&apos;s immediately ice cream weather for me! Today was 73, so getting Mitchell&apos;s was a no brainer. Plus, we got our flu shots today, so this was our treat. Also, it&apos;s been a while. Okay, I&apos;ll stop making excuses for getting ice cream before dinner, on a Monday nonetheless. 

Wait, more confessions. We got our individual single scoops of ice cream PLUS a pint of strawberry and a quarter of their seasonal pumpkin to take for home. They sell 1/2 gallons too! I didn&apos;t get a 1/2 gallon though.. I have self control, you see.

Okay on to the good stuff. My single scoop today was the espresso toffee crunch. It was good, lots of chunks of espresso chewy beans, and boasted the classic creamy Mitchell&apos;s texture. However, I wouldn&apos;t get it again.  My husband got &quot;The Big Cheese&quot;, which was a cheesecake lovers&apos; dream - highly recommended. My kids got the Oreo cookie- that was really good too! Huge pieces of Oreo cookie in a single scoop were delicious.

Let&apos;s talk about their &quot;single&quot; scoop really quick. This single is the biggest single scoop out there. You can totally ask them to give you a smaller version of the scoop too.

The guy ringing us up today was so nice and patient as I gave him our long list. The plexiglass felt safe, the payment was contactless, and you wait at the front of the line for your orders so you don&apos;t have to &quot;excuse me, pardon me&quot; your way past anyone with your ice cream cones. 

I&apos;m super excited to try the pumpkin ice cream sitting in my freezer (soon to be sitting on my lap)."
5,During Covid - this place is awesome I have been here so many times to try there newest flavors and the classic flavors. I have been here before covid where you can sample the ice cream before purchasing but due to covid they do not allow samples. But any flavor you get you wont be disappointed. I usually get the rocky road and horshata and they taste amazing right amount of sweetness. Last time I went I did see that horchata was discontinued as the seasons change so does the ice cream flavors. But what ever flavor you you won&apos;t be disappointed. For safety covid measures they have a line outside that raps around the building and there is 6 feet space between each person. And the line moves quickly so there isn&apos;t much of a wait. I would recommend this to anyone to try and enjoy it try new flavors that you never thought ice cream could be
4,"They are open for business during Covid. There are shields up to protect the customer and employee during ordering. 
You can only purchase ice cream in a cup that&apos;s covered. No cones :( I understand it&apos;s for safety reasons.  you can also purchase gallon ice creams to go. 
it&apos;s just a different time and we all need to adapt. I would have to say that this business is trying their best, but I felt a bit sad and defeated walking back to my car with my ice cream smushed in a cup and covered for my protection. The ice cream buying experience is not the same, but we need to support businesses trying their best to serve our neighborhood. 
The ice cream quality is still consistently  good"
5,"During the current pandemic, it&apos;s great that this spot is still thriving. This is one of my favorite spots in San Francisco so I&apos;m glad it&apos;s still here. 

While they currently don&apos;t have the full menu they used to, they have most of what someone would look for from an experience at Mitchell&apos;s. They have all their ice cream flavors as well as some new seasonal options. Cups and cones are available along with most toppings. Their 1/2 gallons and ice cream cakes are also still available.

Mitchell&apos;s is a San Francisco icon and I hope it continues to be around for decades to come - definitely visit this incredible spot! The ice cream is tough to beat!"
5,Always a delicious treat. Ice Cream spot that has been around forever sand with good reason. They have many Unique flavors as well as some of the good old standards. The shop is clean and the employees are friendly. They have a few parking spot s in the rear and I Imagine they get full quick in the summer. The line and wait are worth it.
5,Best ice cream anywhere i have had it in the state&apos;s. Also they have a full list of vegan options. Go Mitchel&apos;s ypue guys know what your doing.
5,"Mitchell&apos;s is the bomb!  I&apos;ve been getting ice cream here for about 20 years, and honestly they never disappoint.  Flavors are great, and there are a variety of sizes you can order, from a pint all the way to a gallon!  This place is awesome for grabbing ice cream as a pick me up for someone, to take a date too after dinner, to treat yourself, or to grab ice cream to impress everyone at the dinner party later that night!  I highly recommend this place.  Fave flavor is the Grasshopper one."
5,"I&apos;m very picky about my ice cream and Mitchell&apos;s earns my 5 stars. Ordered the tropical 4 and it had a good mix of fruit flavors. As we were eating, my husband kept saying &quot;this ice cream is thiccccc.&quot; That&apos;s exactly how I like my ice cream. Not icey, but thiccccc and flavorful. 

Very friendly service. Love the energy of the staff!"
