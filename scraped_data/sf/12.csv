5,"Shopping! [Japantown, San Francisco]

I love the stores here... they just make me want to explore. Daiso is in the East Mall but many of the stores and restaurants I like are in the West Mall. Daiso has plenty ideas for stocking stuffers... lots of trinkets and Japanese candy. One can easily stuff even a huge stocking. I love wandering down the aisles. This location is huge. 

I found some great gift ideas here in Japan Center. I stopped by a bookstore, a women&apos;s clothing boutique, jewelry, cosmetics, and children&apos;s gifts. Katachi has a nice collection of swords and knives. Mai Do is a store that carries high quality calligraphy supplies, stationeries and specialty papers. There are also stores for music lovers... one selling ukeleles and a lot of &quot;island&quot; merchandise and another store selling Japanese instruments like the koto. 

While Japan Center is currently operating and remain open during Purple Tier restrictions (worst tier) there are some strict guidelines the public must adhere to while inside the mall -- wear masks and keep appropriate distance from each other. The Japan Center malls (East and West) are open to foot traffic and holiday shopping although the retail stores are limited to 20% capacity from normal. Each store has posted instructions and guidelines upon entering so just be aware of them. The restaurants are also open, though only for take out and delivery. No indoor dining and the public is advised to not eat inside the malls.

There you go...

5,"Although this campus is showing its age, having been built over 50 years ago and featuring Brutalist architectural throwbacks, it remains a vibrant, well-utilized space, particularly if you&apos;re a fan of Japanese food, products, or culture. 

The cast of businesses will rotate over time (especially in our current uncertain economic climate), but I appreciate that there&apos;s such a large mix of eateries and shops at different price points. My favorite is Marufuku Ramen, where you can get quality, nicely portioned bowls at reasonable prices for the Bay Area. You can also find mid- to higher-end sushi as well as casual kiosks selling items like takoyaki, onigiri, and matcha ice cream. 

There are also tons of small and larger shops, perhaps the most well-known of them being the Kinokuniya bookstore, which has a large selection of gifts and tchotchkes on one floor and a whole downstairs room devoted to manga. Check out their separate Yelp listing for more info. 

Despite the concrete-abundant architecture, there are welcome touches like the pagoda in the outdoor plaza or how some interior hallways look like real Japanese alleys thanks to the way the shop facades are decorated. 

While certainly touristy, there&apos;s also so much that&apos;s substantive and authentic to explore here. So much so, in fact, that you&apos;ll be hard pressed to find anything like it in the U.S., besides Japantown in Los Angeles. Too bad many of the mom-and-pop merchants here are being squeezed to the brink of closure by their landlords."
5,"Finally got to go here! Part of the mall is like a night market. Foods like takoyaki, mochi donuts, and green tea soft serve to name a few. Other sections of the mall are for restaurants and shopping. If you&apos;re in the area, this is a great stop!"
2,"Japan Center clearly has seen better days.  This mall looks like it was a glorious place to spend time in the 80&apos;s and every bit of it looks like it stayed in that era.  

The lighting is straight up depressing and the entire place looks dingy.  Store selection is fine but quite honestly nothing you couldn&apos;t find in any Asian enclave or supermarket.  Restaurant selection here is pretty awful and the food we ate here was subpar.  

If you&apos;re curious, you should definitely take a look.  I just think your expectations need to be lowered since it&apos;s basically an old mall with bad food."
4,How come I did not know about Japan Center before?? This place is so unique and fun. I am adding it to the list of places to take out of towners when they are visiting. Lots of unique cool stores and amazing eats and drinks. Convenient inexpensive parking in the basement as well.
4,"Must see site for Japanese Americans, Japanophiles, tourists from anywhere, people with a curiosity about American history and anyone who loves ramen (real ramen).  There&apos;s really nothing like this anywhere else anywhere.  People who criticize the crowded dated mall are missing the point.  This is an important symbol for Japanese America, even us Hapas.  I like to sit in the plaza, people watch and remember my haha (お母ちゃん)."
5,"I love taking folks to Japan Center, especially if it&apos;s raining outside.

My favorites below:
- East Mall: Daiso, Uji Time Dessert
- West Mall (Nijiya-side): Mochill Mochidonut, cute Japanese stores (manga merch, stuffed animals, videos), daigo shop
- West Mall (AMC-side): Kinokuniya book store, Matcha Cafe Maiko, Marufuku Ramen, Udon Mugizo"
3,"Came here because I was waiting to eat at Marufuku! While waiting, my bf and I walked around. Lots of food places,desserts,book stores. They have ice cream, mochi donuts, chocolates, noodle places, Japanese food of course, takoyaki."
4,"There&apos;s always a good energy whenever you&apos;re on Peace Plaza or wandering around the hallways and odd corridors of Japan Center that suddenly dead-end. 

Couples meander and families walk and linger near the kid-friendly frozen yogurt and crepe places. People of all ages who seem to be mostly locals populate the mall, especially on rainy days. 

Everyone seems relaxed and never in a hurry. The vibe is always chill. Maybe the Peace Pagoda elevates everyone into a Zen state.

The retail and restaurant mix is best described as eclectic and it has a bit of everything: Very good ramen and (floating boat!) sushi restaurants, frozen yogurt and a crepe place, a large bookstore, excellent galleries, a kimono shop, Daiso Japan, a bakery, nail salon - all within a nutty amalgamation of 1960s buildings that are a little shabby and not the most inviting design. 

There are useful and interesting businesses all around Japan Center like a good a grocery (Nijiya Market), the Kabuki Hot Springs &amp; Spa, Soko Hardware (bamboo steam baskets, sake sets and teapots) and a dozen more restaurants to choose from.

There&apos;s an underground garage that&apos;s cheaper than getting a ticket for an expired meter - and I think some businesses validate. I usually find street parking and tend to be in Japantown after 6 or on Sundays.

Go and explore - and bring your appetite because there are quite a few wallet-friendly dining options you&apos;ll want to try."
1,"Great stores, BAD mall. 

Some of our favorite stores and restaurants in San Francisco are in the Japan Center mall. We go there *at least* once a week. 

Unfortunately, the mall itself is bad. 

The worst thing about visiting our favorite places in Japan Center is Japan Center itself. It&apos;s old. It&apos;s badly climate controlled. And the restrooms are a horror show! They range from bad to awful. When I see tourists walk into these bathrooms, I feel a little embarrassed that this is the impression they are getting of San Francisco. 

See photos. These were taken in May of 2019 but was still just as bad on my trip there yesterday."
5,"I still come here every time I&apos;m in town. The food is great and there are a lot of options to choose from and also if you just want to buy supplies or little trinkets to use or bring home.

The boy and I wanted to grab something to eat so we opted to come here. Everything looked good and parking was cheap and easy to find. The japan center has two separate wings and it&apos;s not large, but large enough if you&apos;re looking for something to eat or drink.

There&apos;s always a crowd when I go and there&apos;s plenty to do. I&apos;ll be back again."
4,"Japan Center is a shopping mall in the heart of Japantown. It contains a lot of mom &amp; pop stores and restaurants. You can find some unique Japanese items here that are only available in Japan.

The mall consists of two sections, the west and east malls. It separated by a plaza which contains a 5-story pagoda which within itself is a sight to see. It is anchored by two of the popular stores, Daiso Japan and Nijiya Market.

Parking is available at Japan Center but only a few businesses provide partial validation for your parking."
5,"I really loved japan center. Favorite was the sign outside &quot;FUKU sushi&quot; I love the name of the restaurant :))))

There are different wings so check out all buildings! So much to offer! Restaurants, shops, authentic stores, flower shops, ice cream, etc.

A must visit when you&apos;re in SF!"
4,Beutiful in here and its also open. Now i noticed that i can get inside! So happy. Mpst of thestored are close but its still nice.
5,"Absolutely amazing place to be. I truly enjoyed all of the cute amazing shops here with tons of Rilakkuma, Studio Ghibli, Pokemon, Sailor Moon, and more items. Loved the book shop, restaurants, and karaoke here. The crepes, icecream, and more are all so amazing. Cute tea pot shops all around. One of my most favorite places to be in all of California. Tons of happiness and joy here!"
3,"Cool shopping mall in Japantown with quite a few of the essentials.  A Nijiya supermarket, gift shops, desserts, pastries, and a bunch of restaurants."
5,"Japan Center has two wings which are full of amazing stores and restaurants: Daiso, Ichiban Kan, Kinokuniya bookstore, crepes, anime merch, beauty products, and lots of delicious food. This is the best place to stop by because there are so many great shops to visit and so much great food to eat. It&apos;s always a great time when I come here. Lots of parking available, there&apos;s even a parking garage. Amazing place!"
5,"Originally called the Japanese Cultural and Trade Center when if opened in 1968, the Japan Center has a lot to offer.

There are some really cute shops here. I really enjoyed seeing the kimono shop and spending time in the book store. Plenty of food options from Crepe and yogurt shops to the very popular ramen restaurant. There is something for everyone. 

The building and design might be dated but it is super charming and full of energy and great for people watching."
5,"The East &amp; West Japan Center Malls are located in Japantown.

There are plenty of mom and pop shops, restaurants, frozen yogurt, pastries, snacks, coffee shops, crepes, etc. here. Come hungry! The East and West Malls are located in between the Japantown Peace Pagoda. This beautiful five-tiered concrete stupa was designed by Japanese architect Yoshiro Taniguchi. It was donated to Japantown in 1968 by the City of Osaka, San Francisco&apos;s sister city in Japan. It has become one of Japantown&apos;s main landmarks. 

Don&apos;t forget to explore all the cultural opportunities throughout this neighborhood."
4,"Japan Center is a fun place to visit if you want to feel like you&apos;re in Japan. There&apos;s garage parking that&apos;s reasonably priced ($2.5 per hour whenever we went) and we&apos;ve always found a spot. It wasn&apos;t overly crowded on the Thursday evening we went and only marginally a bit more crowded on a weekend night. 

A lot of the stores are indoors too so it&apos;s a good place to visit if it&apos;s raining outside"
