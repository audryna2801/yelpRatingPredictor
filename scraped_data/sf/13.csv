5,"We ordered takeout back in December. It was a little difficult to find the shop since I wasn&apos;t familiar with the area/shopping plaza. Because of Covid, there was only one main entrance, so we had to walk around to find it. The food was ready at the expected time. Everything was well packaged. We ordered the hakata Tonkatsu DX ($18.50), extra Tonkatsu broth ($6), and takoyaki ($7). 

The ramen definitely hit the spot in the cold SF weather. Noodles were perfect and chewy. Broth was flavorful and delicious. It came decked out with toppings, but I would&apos;ve probably preferred no corn. The takoyaki had good flavor, but it was very soft and soggy, probably partially due to us taking awhile before actually eating it."
5,"I tried Marufuku to-go for the first time during this pandemic. I had my expectations low because I was afraid it was over-hyped by friends and Yelp ratings. However, even to-go, their ramen blew me away. The broth was so flavorful and also felt unique to them. I got the Chicken Paitan and my roommate for the Tonkatsu, both of them really good! Next time, I think I&apos;m going to get the Tonkatsu for myself. I&apos;m also really picky with ramen noodles but their&apos;s were really good, I loved them. The soft-boiled egg was also cooked to perfection."
5,"We get delivery from here every now and then because they have the best ramen. Everything is packaged well, noodles are separated, and utensils are provided. Nothing leaked upon arrival and everything was delicious. The spinach ramen was delicious too and you couldn&apos;t really tell the difference. I even had enough broth left over to use with my own noodles at home. They do give the chili powder separate from broth so you must add it in if you want some fire."
4,"3.5

Always a wait / line, so had really high expectations.  It&apos;s good but not great.  Only one vegetarian option.  The broth was super tasty but the toppings were basic - arugula, onion, tomato, bellpepper, and bland tofu.  

I&apos;m thinking they may be more geared toward meat eaters..."
4,"Just wanted to update this 2 year old review of my favorite ramen place in San Francisco.

Covid has changed many places and  Marufuku is no different.  I assume they might be doing as well as ever.  They always had long lines and waitlists that I&apos;m sure did not satisfy all the people in line.

I love their cozy space in Japantown but finally broke down for take out.  When I think about having waited there in lines as long as an hour long, calling ahead and finding my order would be ready in 10 minutes was amazing!  Definitely bring someone along as there is no parking with all the outdoor dining structures.

I got my usual tonkatsu and Marufuku bites.  Everything was as I remembered.  So good!  Probably the only thing I&apos;d say that is bad is that two years ago when I wrote my first review in 2019 the ramen was 12.95 and as you can see on the me u it is $14.95 but I was charged $15.50.  Two years ago the Bites were $6 and the menu now says $7 but I was charged $8.

Happy to support local businesses."
4,"So so good!! Marufuku has been saved in my Yelp bookmarks for so long, but I&apos;ve never gotten the chance to try it until now because the lines pre-Covid were insane. Glad I got to try it to-go. I was afraid the quality would be compromised because it was to-go, but we reheated the noodles and it was perfect. The broth is amazing and the meat portions are very generous. Highly recommend the Hakata Tonkotsu DX! We got an order of the Chicken Karaage on the side also and it was great. If you order to-go, they will separate the spice powder so you can tailor how much you want in the soup on your own."
5,"Aw man this place is always so good!! It&apos;s pricey for sure, but I don&apos;t skimp on the ramen and always get the XD! Dank meat and noodles and everything. Not pictured, but the karaage is SO delicious too! But be warned, your burps will smell pretty gross haha."
4,"Ordering during the pandemic is easy. Online website has flexibility in choosing what you do and don&apos;t want. I personally don&apos;t like sesame seeds or bean sprouts so I was able to check a box to say remove. 

Pick up was also easy. We went right before closing so there was parking outside. The desk has a bell to ring in case someone isn&apos;t there. Give your name, get your food and good to go! Packaging was also great. 

Noodles and soup are separated and quality is still fantastic. We got the deluxe and the stewed pork could&apos;ve been more tender. But overall satisfying!"
3,"Marufuku serves a good Hatake style tonkotsu. The egg is done so it&apos;s still gooey as it should be and the noodles are slightly undercooked for takeout but that&apos;s perfect. Karrage bowl has good flavour but due to the nature of takeout maybe, lacks in crunchiness. The rice however was great, very sweet and complements the tonkotsu broth. 
I did crave more pickled things, especially like a umeboshi or something to reset my palette as tonkotsu broths are pretty salty and thick. If I could make a change I would hope for less saltiness in the broth and more umami. Also it would be nice if the egg was marinated so that the soft whites carried flavour to complement the broth.

Overall satisfies the ramen craving during CoVID !"
4,"Can&apos;t believe I haven&apos;t reviewed this place yet, but been coming here a few times to take out of town friends for some yummy Japanese ramen and to tourist Japantown with them! Although now with covid, this has been a great quick pick up spot especially during colder days. I especially love the fact how they prepack the soupless to-go bowls separately from their ramen broths and even include instructions how to properly eat and heat at home. If you&apos;re impatient and desire hot ramen soup ready at pick up then I definitely do not recommend this place. Their packing presentation allows the deliciousness to be eaten correctly, and good things do come to those who wait! I do recommend to add the karaage as an app, super crispy and full of flavors especially with the lemon included, to include to your order when choosing your desired ramen! Itadakimasu!"
3,"Was in the Bay Area for Valentine&apos;s Day and was coming back from Point Reyes. I really wanted to try their ramen. 

Packaging: everything  was served very nicely. 1. Each utensils were in their own separate bag with a pair of chopstick and a spoon. 
2. Each  spice level was packaged in its own little container. 
3. The liquid and noodles were also separated. 
4. The bowl held the noodles and all the other ingredients. They labeled each container with your add-ons and special requests. 
5. All other items were packaged separately. 

What I ordered: 
1. Geso fry [4.5 stars]
Fried squid was really good. It was nicely fried even though it wasn&apos;t crispy anymore. It still held up. Not overly battered and battered was seasoned well. 
2. Takoyaki (5pc )[ 4 stars]
I really liked it. They were a good size and not too doughy. A lot of squid and veggies inside 
3. Tonkotsu  and 4. Tonkotsu DX
The chashu was really tender but not too fatty. Our pork belly was on the more fattier side but I didn&apos;t mind it. If you don&apos;t like fatty, then stick to the regular Tonkotsu. The broth was also really rich and with the added spice it was perfect. One major complaint is how they prepared the noodles. 

I believe that the noodles in a ramen is just as important and the chashu and broth. The noodle was gummy and a there were two big clumps of noodles that were not pleasing to chew nor eat. I know they&apos;re just trying to be more efficient but adding cold water to wash away the starch would have made it so much better.  :/ 

I did take it home and try to &quot;unclump the noodles&quot;, just in case it was a &quot;heat thing&quot; but was unsuccessful. 
For an $14.50-$18.50, I wish they paid attention to their noodles."
4,"Pre-COVID dining. 

I remember the hype when Marufuku Ramen opened a location in Japantown. It surely needed an authentic ramen joint since some of the ramen spots and eateries here weren&apos;t Japanese-owned and operated. The lines were always long and we waited until it died down little. It never did, so we decided to bite the bullet and fall in line like everyone else. 

The location is on the north west section on 2nd floor of Japantown&apos;s Kintetsu Mall across from Kinokuniya Book Store and Sophie&apos;s Crepe. Needless to say, there is always foot traffic here due to the popularity of the aforementioned places. We got here around 1830 hours and got inside around 1940 hours. Quite a bit of a wait, but it was worth it.

I loved the interior design of the place as they used a light-colored wood on the walls that emitted a warm and inviting feel when it was illuminated by the sunlight. And the use of shoji to adorn the walls facing the windows gives it that authentic Japanese feel. It even reminded me of the movie &apos;Samurai Fiction&apos; and &apos;KIll Bill&apos; as the glow from the sun provides natural lighting inside.

I ordered the Hakata Tonkutsu DX ($18.50) - a Hakata Style Ramen with Rich Pork Broth, regular toppings (chashu pork (simmered pork belly),
seasoned soft boiled egg, green onions, kikurage mushrooms,
bean sprouts) &amp; buta kakuni (braised thick pork belly), corn and nori seaweed. 

Wifey ordered the Chicken Paitan DX ($18.50) - a Chicken Ramen with Rich White &quot;Paitan&quot; Broth, regular toppings (chashu chicken breast, seasoned soft
boiled egg, green onions, kikurage mushrooms, bean sprouts)
&amp; grilled chicken leg on a sizzling plate, sweet corn and nori seaweed. We also ordered a side of Mentaiko Bowl ($5.00) - a Spicy Seasoned Cod Roe over rice, green onion, sesame seed, kaiware sprout and nori seaweed.

The ramens were delicious and the grilled chicken was superb. The broth definitely had that umami effect and the noodles had a nice chewy consistency that absorb the flavors from the broth. It was slurpatcular, but we didn&apos;t actually &quot;slurp&quot; as one would eat them in Japan. The Mentaiko Bowl was a nice side dish, but we actually didn&apos;t finish it since we were full. Service was warm, friendly and typical of a Japanese-run establishment. 

Haven&apos;t been back since, but they are open for delivery and take-out during this pandemic. We will definitely return again sooner or later.

5,We decided to try the ramen from marufuku since we were in japan town. tasted great - a fantastic place to have ramen. The flavor of the broth and the noodles were perfect. The only thing is that this place is pretty expensive.
4,"We did a pickup from Marufuku Ramen SF during COVID-19. Our order was ready for pickup in about thirty minutes, which is pretty good given a lot of places we&apos;ve been ordering from take about an hour to deliver. We&apos;ve previously wanted to try this place but been turned away by the long wait times so it&apos;s nice to have the pickup and delivery orders with shorter wait times now. 

We ordered the Buta Kakuni (soft thick braised pork belly) and Hakata Tonkotsu DX. The pork belly was juicy on the inside and crunchy on the outside - just the way it should be! 

The ramen was given to us with instructions to warm it for 2 to 3 minutes in the microwave and then add in the ingredients. We did just that and it turned out OK, but I may warm it longer or even on the stove top next time to get it hotter. I found the broth to be delicious and thick, and the meat was good as well!  We prefer thick noodles so I wasn&apos;t as big of a fan of their thinner noodles (which reminds me too much of instant noodles and doesn&apos;t seem to soften enough when the broth is poured over it). 

We were able to find street parking in the area pretty easily but not sure if that&apos;s the case in non-Covid times. This location is also inside a larger building with other Japanese stores and restaurants that I can&apos;t wait to try!"
4,"If you live in SF and haven&apos;t waited in line for Marufuku before, can you really be considered a resident? It&apos;s actually crazy how long people are willing to wait for their ramen. I went once pre-COVID and added my name to the Yelp waitlist 2 HOURS before I was able to get seated. The waitlist is a great feature though since you can add your name while at home and kill time until you need to check in.

If you haven&apos;t been before, I actually think coming during COVID is a good idea. You still have to wait a bit for your order because they have a crazy amount of customers with all the online orders and delivery services, but it&apos;s not as bad as waiting several hours for a table. 

My boyfriend and I ordered online for pick-up on a Friday night and only had to wait 10 minutes more than what our pick-up window was supposed to be. I ordered the hakata tonkotsu (spicy) and was disappointed when I discovered that it had no spice at all. Regardless, I can&apos;t deny the fact that it&apos;s a great bowl of ramen: the broth is flavorful, the noodles are thin and perfectly cooked, and the soft-boiled egg is melt-in-your-mouth amazing. My boyfriend got a mentaiko bowl (in addition to his ramen), and I swear these $5 rice bowls are why we&apos;ll keep returning. Don&apos;t sleep on the bowls!"
5,"This place was my greatest discovery yet Thank you Yelp! If it wasn&apos;t for Yelp I would not have come here mid day on a Sunday in January and the wait is 90 minutes you can get a place on the line from your Yelp app. So after getting on line we leave our hotel and go shopping naturally from their we get over to a part of San Francisco that I do not know. I love it now even more. All locals and even they are waiting the system is great they have a podium at the door and you can find your Yelp name listed. They take by wait order only this is great no cheating the system. 

I met a lot of locals that have never been but was on their list to check out. Finally we get called &quot; Clarissa K&quot; party of 2 hey that&apos;s me thanks. I don&apos;t even look at the menu why bother these people know what they are doing so I just ask the waitress what&apos;s good And I get the soup for two which is ginormous the pork buns, the chicken I think we snagged the last one and fried rice. 
Later that night back at the hotel I see the wait times increase to over three hours. 

Lastly this is going to be hard to believe the price was peanuts OMG! If I lived in San Francisco I would go here once a week at least the food is mind blowing. I even told Chef friends of mine in LA they gotta check this place out. A must on your go to list and again I would have never found it if it wasn&apos;t for Yelp and the over 3,000 reviews I am eternally grateful."
3,"The wait for this place was an hour on a Sunday at 2 pm. We walked around and looked at the shops so time flew by. 

For the gyoza we were disappointed on how bland they were inside. Desperately needed salt. Chicken Paitan tasted very similar to chicken broth and lacked depth. Tonkatsu also lacked a lot of flavor. All in all, unimpressed. 

I would try ippudo or orenchi if you&apos;re looking for a flavorful broth."
3,"I ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu delivery through Caviar and was unfortunately quite disappointed. The noodles and meat are delivered in a solid bowl, and the broth is in a another plastic bowl. It&apos;s easy enough to pour the broth into the noodles with no spillage issues. The broth was delicious, and the meat was fatty and well-seasoned. However, the noodles congealed during delivery and never separated. So it just become a block of noodles with soup and meat on top. 

I also ordered the shishito peppers, which were too hot to eat more than a few at a time. 

I would try again in person for hopefully a better experience, but wouldn&apos;t order delivery again."
5,"Eating here was a great experience with great food, service, and atmosphere! 

The waiters were attentive and kind. Our cups were always full of water, they promptly took our order and delivered our food, and were responsive to any other needs we had. They were kind and cleared our tables quickly of any trash or finished plates.

The food was delicious! My friend and I ordered the chicken karaage for an appetizer. It was lightly breaded with a lot of dark, juicy meat and a yummy spicy mayo sauce. We also got the Hakata Tonkotsu DX which had flavorful succulent pork, a perfectly cooked soft boiled egg, green onions, mushrooms, bean sprouts, corn, nori, and soft tender pork belly. The broth was flavorful and balanced (not over salted as a lot of ramen places do). The noodles were different than expected but still tasty and cooked properly, and the spice level was perfect. We ordered extra noodles and shared the one order of ramen which was the perfect size. We were both full after!

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves ramen and is looking to find a new go to ramen place."
5,"This was one of the best Ramens I ever had. I went with my husband, there were 3 tables before us and we only had to wait around 20-25 min. Pretty fast service and the place has an insane traffic coming from takeout/delivery apps. 
The marufuku bite was simply amazing. Is a bite size so is a must! The ramen was from another world. Their broth was THE BEST! This huge piece of pork is packed of flavor and the thick cut makes even better. It was interesting to me that they kept the spice on the side depending on what you order (medium, spicy, super spicy). So you can order and make it to your taste. Super flavorful spicy too!! 
I definitely found my go-to ramen place in SF! Highly recommend. :)"
