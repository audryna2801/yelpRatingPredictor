5,"Their fried chicken is definitely worth the hype. I think the chicken meat and fried skin are standard quality, but it&apos;s the extremely flavorful, dense, sticky sauce that gives a wow factor. It&apos;s so good that my friends would mix the leftover sauce with fried rice we ordered LOL

Other than the fried chicken, I highly recommend their sautéed green beans, leek and shrimp dumplings, black bean noodles, and peanut noodles with shrimps. I think their fried rice is pretty average. 

During covid, they only accept takeout orders placed via phone call. No delivery apps, website for online orders. You must call them and they ask for your credit card info so you get charged before you pick up the food.

It&apos;s an extremely popular spot especially on weekend nights, so make sure to call an hour ahead of time to place your order. I&apos;ve gotten takeouts from here several time both on weekends and weekdays, and every time I had to wait for about an hour to get my order ready for pickup. 

It&apos;s also hard to even get your call to go through if it&apos;s a weekend night. It would seem like your call is not going through, but it&apos;s because the line is too busy. You just gotta keep calling them until they can pick up your call so it&apos;s a bit stressful, but the fried chicken is definitely worth it."
5,"Best. Wings. Ever

Always a packed house (pre-Covid)!  Come during lunch and you&apos;ll find the wait to be about 1.5-2.5 hours!  But it&apos;s so worth it!

I&apos;ve actually ordered 3 times during 2020 and they were all take- out.  Always get the wings and dumplings!"
5,"I love San Tung, always have and always will. I crave their chicken so often. This was the first time I&apos;ve made my way to SF and got San Tung during Covid. They are not talking walk in orders, only preorders over the phone. Their establishment took many Covid precautions. One way in, one way out. Long area for customers to pick up their food and sign their receipts without being close together. 

Food was amazing as usual. I like both their regular chicken wings as well as their boneless. I normally don&apos;t like boneless anywhere, but because their sauce can be super sticky and messy, I prefer to eat their boneless when we&apos;re eating on the road or picnicking with no hand washing access."
5,"This place is AMAZING.
This is our go to spot whenever we are in the area haha.
one of the best chicken places in the bay hands down yee
we always get some green beans, black bean sauce noods, and dumplings.
be ready to wait to be seated or be aggressive at the counter to get your to go order and following up with them like every 5 minutes when they are super busy haha"
5,"I finally got to try San Tung! This place is a Bay Area classic and everyone has been here - EXCEPT me until now. I am lucky enough to have friends to pick up these wings for me. After the hour drive from SF to SJ, these wings were still piping hot! Were they delicious? Absolutely! The glaze is super savory and sweet with a slight kick. You can taste the ginger in the sauce. It paired great with hot white rice which we made at home. BEAUTIFUL - will be back and hopefully I can have it again in person."
5,"Love love love the Dry Fried Chicken Wings! And the Black Bean Sauce Noodles! 

You have to phone in your order, no walk ups. I ordered at 4:15pm and it was ready when they opened at 4:30pm. Service was fast and they have self service napkins and chopsticks and sanitizer out. Definitely recommend to go early to avoid lines. I found a parking spot easily but I know parking in the area can be tricky."
4,"I&apos;ve been going here for so many years, probably since college, and that is a looooong time ago. 

I will get to the point :

- used to be long wait to get a table so this is nice silver lining with pandemic that we can get to go and eat at home
- of course it&apos;s the original chicken wings which has a sauce that is unmatched
- dumplings may not survive a long drive so pass for take out
- noodles are good but will also not be as good from  a long drive home that is more than 20 mins
- greens are tasty warm or cold

Love the food, although not the same dining there it is a treat that they are open for takeout. Very efficient where you call in the order. They will tell you how long and give your last 4 digits of your phone number. 

Once you get there, give them your &apos;code&apos; and they will hand you the bag of goodies."
5,"One of the best Chinese restaurants in SF. Good flavors and the food doesn&apos;t leave that sticky feeling in your stomach that over processed foods can leave you.

I&apos;d definitely recommend the Dried Chicken - very crispy with a sweet honey taste. I also like the sautéed green beans, braised bean curd, vegetable chow mein and hot and sour soup. Good portions for two and you&apos;ll have plenty of leftovers for a few more meals.

For ordering, they do not take online orders, you have to call in and give your phone number as a way for them to keep track of your order. That said, be very clear on your phone number, so you&apos;ll be to able hear it when you pick up your food. Lately, this place has been very busy, so even if you order on the phone, be prepared to wait 10-15 min after you arrive to pick up your food. It&apos;s still worth the wait though! Just prepare yourself with warm clothing if it&apos;s cold"
3,"My grandparents used to take little 10-year-old me here all the time. Back then, this restaurant was pretty quiet with only a few tables occupied each visit. Fast forward 15ish years, and social media named this place as having the best dry fried chicken. Crowds started to pour in, wait times were hours long, and they even opened up a second shop next door. I&apos;ve avoided it during all those years, but now that Covid hit and take-out is the only option, I&apos;ve decided to grab lunch to-go and relive those fond memories.

I ordered for my family: dry fried chicken wings, shrimp &amp; leek dumplings, black bean sauce noodles, mu shu pork, kung pao chicken, and sauteed string beans. The wings, I would say, were the biggest disappointment. They were much more saucier (even though they&apos;re called dry) and sweeter than I remembered, or maybe my tolerance for sweetness as a kid was higher. By the time we got home, they weren&apos;t all that crispy either, but that&apos;s not necessarily their fault. For the dumplings, they didn&apos;t give us any vinegar, soy sauce, or chili oil, so they were pretty bland.

Surprises for me were the black bean sauce noodles and the mu shu pork. This was my first time having both here, and if I were to come back, those two would for sure be on my list. Overall, I think the flavors cater more to Americans / Asian-Americans, so unless I&apos;m taking a tourist friend here who wants to try their famous wings, I can wait another 10 years."
5,"My review for this place is long overdue.

As many people have mentioned, if you are in SF, this place is a must! They have the best dry fried chicken and I also loveeeee their noodles with peanut sauce! I have yet to find a place that is better than San Tung! ( I do not really care for their dumplings and wish I got more chicken instead :( )

They are always super busy, but it was pretty easy/quick for me to call in for pick up. When I arrived early, my food was already ready for pick up! 

Would I go again? Yesssss as their noodles and chicken is always on my mind!"
5,"A beloved favorite. Consistently excellent quality ever since my first visit 8 years ago.

My go-to order for 2 people:
- Original Dry Fried Chicken Wings
- Sautéed String Beans
- Black Bean Sauce Noodles

Do it. You can&apos;t go wrong.

COVID-10 safe -- Call first for take-out (When I called for dinner on a week day, my order was ready in 25 min). Only 1 person from the party is allowed in to pick-up. And you&apos;re only allowed in when your order is ready. Hand sanitizers placed at the entrance and at the pick up station. Both chefs in the back and employees in the front wore masks."
5,"No one makes Chicken Wings like San Tung! Those Dried fry Chicken Wings are something else. Never had wings with a scene of white pepper! Their pretty large for some chicken wings as well. Love their Black Bean Sauce Noodles as well. Basically had the two dishes they we&apos;re most known for and did not disappoint. Arguably the best Chinese Food dishes in San Francisco!

FYI: When you call in for some togo order and they say it will be ready in 30minute, it actually wont be ready until 40min. Happened many times.


Here is a Full Video Review I did:

4,"Mmmm... I&apos;m still dreaming about their chicken wings! 

Ordered:
- Original dry fried chicken wings x3 ($13.50x3) - SOO GOOD!
- Five spice beef soup noodles ($12) - this was a HUGE amount of food!
- Honey walnut prawns ($18) - really yummy and still crispy after a 50mins ride back home!
- Dry black bean sauce noodle ($12) - mehh, wouldn&apos;t order this again

Some how the total came out to $96 before tip. I was a bit shocked to see it was almost $100! Maybe one of the items went up in price from when they last posted their menu on their site.

I recommend calling early to place your order if you can get through the busy phone lines! When you arrive at the restaurant they&apos;ll ask you for the last 4 digits of the phone number you placed the order with. 

We really enjoyed all the dishes we ordered, except the black bean sauce. I don&apos;t think we&apos;ll get that one again next time. Loved the chicken wings though! I was able to successfully reheat the wings in the toaster oven and they were still delicious!

TIPS:
- Call ahead!
- Order the original dry fried chicken wings!
- Double check the receipt and get a copy!"
4,"Original Dry Fried Chicken: omg the BEST WINGS EVER!!! I absolutely love these wings. They&apos;re so flavorful, crunchy, sweet and a lil spicy and the sauce is so good over rice. Got a 1.5 order for takeout and my family devoured them haha. Should have done a double order. 

Potstickers: the skin was super crispy but also squishy. In other words, perfectly fried dough. The filling was flavorful and juicy but way too salty. Same issue with the dumplings we ordered. Too salty which is a shame because otherwise would have given 5 stars"
5,"Fantastic service and food, especially during COVID times!

We had just finished a long hike at Muir Woods and were looking for some satisfying fried food for our drive home. We of course came across San Tung on our search and scrambled to place a phone order. The phone line was busy the first couple of times I called (which is a sign of just how popular this place is). I finally got through and ordered the original dry fried chicken and the green beans, and I was told our food would be ready in 20-25 minutes.

When I arrived, I stepped up to the cashier in the front, provided my phone number, and paid for my order. They handed me a pre-packed bag containing my food and I was on my way. It took me maybe a total of 1 minute from when I walked in the door to when I walked back out. They had taken plenty of precautions including providing hand sanitizer at the counter and providing clean pens for you to use to sign the receipt.

The dry fried chicken, which they are famous for, was soooo good. It was hot, crispy, and had a delicious honey/soy/garlic/chili sauce. The flavor is so unique, and it was honestly some of the best Chinese fried chicken I have had. The green beans were just okay--they were very tender but a little too sweet in my opinion.

Overall, they had incredible chicken wings, and I would love to come back to try them again!"
2,"Order only via phone. Ordered at  05:18 pm on New Year&apos;s Eve. 
-Fried chicken: pretty sweet than spicy. I was expecting something sweet and spicy. I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s the best.
- fried rice: very oily, rice didn&apos;t look fresh.
-Kung Pao chicken: frankly it&apos;s not my favorite. I&apos;ve had better restaurants make Kung Pao Chicken than this place
-String beans: one of the best string beans I&apos;ve ate. Very crispy. 
-Happy Family: not worth the price. 2 or 3 pieces of scallops, shrimp, mostly shiitake mushrooms and baby corn and chicken and beefy 
-Peanut sauce with noodles: It&apos;s literally peanut sauce with noodles (that&apos;s it!) The sauce isn&apos;t enough. It&apos;s too thick and my noodles were super dry. 

I was able to pick up my food at 7:45 pm. We were told that it will be an hour wait. There was a line outside the restaurant for phone order. Then, they call you out based on your phone number (last 4 digits) 

Personally, I don&apos;t see the hype for the chicken. For what I paid, I didn&apos;t feel satisfied. Long wait, there&apos;s a lot of customers just standing around the restaurant. It would have been much safer during covid time if they text us our orders were ready. More convenient for the restaurant and less people to associate with for both employees and other customers.

I noticed the restaurant add a lot of sugar. Every dish we ordered tonight was really sweet. Also, the sauce were pretty similar."
5,"BELIEVE THE HYPE. THE WAIT IS WORTH IT.

I&apos;ve been meaning to come here a long time but two years later, I&apos;ve finally experienced the wonder that is San Tung dry fried chicken wings. Sadly, I don&apos;t have any pictures because after opening the takeout box, we couldn&apos;t resist and immediately devoured the food. One order of chicken wings, green beans, and rice was more than enough food for two people.

The dry fried chicken wings were some of the most addicting wings I&apos;ve had in my life. I&apos;m usually not a sweet + savory person - I dislike things like chinese BBQ pork and honey walnut shrimp, but San Tung&apos;s wings have a perfect balance of heat and sweet that make it irresistibly addicting. There&apos;s a decent amount of kick but the sweet coating keeps it bearable while not being overly sweet. My standard for wings is soy garlic bon chon wings, but this absolutely knocks it out of the park. Pro tip - make sure you get some rice to soak up all of that saucy goodness at the bottom of the takeout container when you&apos;re done with the wings. The green beans weren&apos;t anything to write home about, but it was nice to get some veggies in to fool myself into thinking I was eating a balanced meal. I&apos;d come here again in a heartbeat."
5,"Agree to disagree but I&apos;ve been supporting san tung ever since I was a little kid and their wings taste the same from 15 years ago and now. I love their consistency!

O R D E R E D
-Dry Fried Chicken Wings - duh! Let&apos;s be honest, THIS is what everybody comes here for and it&apos;s their signature dish. 
- Green Beans
- Pork and Cabbage Dumplings
- Pot Stickers - I always ask them to make it a wee crispier, cause why not!
- Seaweed Soup
- Black Bean Noodle

V E R D I C T
Long overdue review! Frank and the fam are the best. Yes there is a wait, pre covid but people still do it, so that must mean they are bomb.com for people to wait 30min+ / 1hr+ for their food. People can complain about the wait, but deep down, they know they want san tung wings. I&apos;m &quot;sure&quot; you can find wings like theirs some place else, but its still not san tung wings. That&apos;s all I gotta say!"
5,"Fall 2020

San Tung is located in the Sunset District. There was metered parking in front of the restaurant but we parked on the street about a block away. 

They are currently only accepting orders through the phone. I tried to order around 5pm but the phone lines were busy so I had to keep trying. I took a short break between each call to leave whoever was on the phone order. When I finally got through, I was told my order would be about 40 minutes. 

San Tung chicken wings have been on my foodie bucket list for a few YEARSSS. I finally got to try them the other week and O M G. The white pepper, ginger, garlic, and peppercorn flavor was amazing. I loved how the chicken was saucy, crispy, and juicy. It was everything I could&apos;ve imagined and more. The original dry fried chicken came with about a dozen pieces for $14.50. We also ordered a side of spinach with garlic for $11.50. 

All of the employees were hustling!! They were working hard to get everyone&apos;s orders out. When my food was ready, they called out the last 4 digits of my phone number. Napkins and utensils were on the side for you to pack yourself if you wanted any. 

I&apos;m looming forward to going back!"
4,"San Tung is known for the dry fried chicken wings. I happened to be around the area and have heard raving reviews from friends, so I thought it was the perfect opportunity to try. 

We knew it was popular, so my friend and I tried calling right when the restaurant opened. Apparently a ton of people were thinking the same thing because the line had the busy tone for at least the first 10 minutes of opening. We were constantly calling too. They didn&apos;t take walk-in orders when we went, so we were stuck trying to constantly call until it went through. Once we placed an order for two fried chicken plates and green beans, the wait was about 30 min+. Good thing there were a ton of shops to browse on the same street. 

Once our order was ready, we drove home (about a 50 min drive) and tried our food. I found it interesting that it was called dry fried chicken because there&apos;s a sticky sauce on the wings, which happens to be on the sweeter side. I kind of feel like the wings were overhyped for me. I tend to like more savory wings, so that may come into play here. I still thought the wings and green beans were solid--I just wouldn&apos;t necessarily go out of my way to get them."
