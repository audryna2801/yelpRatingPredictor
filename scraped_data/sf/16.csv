5,"It doesn&apos;t matter how many times I have been to pier 39, I always like to come back. We didn&apos;t see any sea lions this time, but next time we will. Even though it&apos;s during the pandemic the kids rides and mirror maze are closed , but the vibes here is still good. Several restaurants are open for outdoor seatings, shops souvenirs , candys, biscoff , etc.  are all open. Parking garage aren&apos;t crowded."
5,Awesome place to visit even with the COVID-19 pandemic . My wife and I had a great time .
5,"I&apos;ve been to San Fran a few times but have never visited Pier 39, until I saw a flyer at the hotel I was staying at, regarding Tulip Mania at Pier 39, luckily we were vacationing at the time that Tulip Mania  was going on. We walked over from our hotel which was real close. There was also a daily tour but we had missed it, it was only one tour every morning. I enjoyed walking around on my own enjoying all the tulips. I love flowers and seeing all the beautiful and colorful tulips around Pier 39 brings back memories of when I visited the Tulip garden in Oregon last year. After checking out the tulips, we walked around Pier 39, had our bathroom break, stopped by the California Welcome Center to grab a fun pack, took tons of photos, learned about the sea lions and got to see live sea lions at K-Dock on level 2. 

Note, although we walked and didn&apos;t need to park our car, if you get the fun pack at the visitor center, there is a coupon for one hour free parking and money saving coupons.

There are lots of shops, eateries, dessert and souvenir shops, but we already had  lunch plans. We will check out the eateries next time we visit. Pier 39 is known for serving up some of the freshest and most delicious SF dishes, from the famous clam chowder in a sourdough bread to local crab, there are many restaurants to choose from. Ex. Bubba Gump, Chart House, Crab House, Hard Rock Cafe, and so many more. Note to self for my next visit, I have to make a stop at Bubba Gump, now that the one on Oahu closed down.

Overall, great first time experience, it is touristy but a must visit just to experience Pier 39. Pier 39 is where San Francisco meets the Bay to Play."
5,"I never get tired of Fisherman&apos;s Wharf. I&apos;m in San Jose and I normally go here once a year just to hang out and be a tourist for a day. 

Nothing like the hustle and bustle of people from around the globe. I never get sick of visiting Fisherman&apos;s Wharf.

I take BART into SF. Get off at the Embarcadero station and walk around the FW area. Eat a bowl of chowder, visit the sea lions, and walk the piers. Great way to get your steps in for the day."
3,"The boys and I needed to buy some souvenirs and found so many stores here. The great thing was it wasn&apos;t super overpriced so we were able to buy so many things. There were plenty of magnets, clothes, keychains, postcards, house items, etc.

This place is packed with tourists and locals alike. They have so many options to choose between boutiques, souvenir shops, and also restaurants. We were wandering around for awhile just exploring the area.

Street parking isn&apos;t too difficult to find, but we went on a weekday and there were plenty of people around. You could definitely catch some nice views here and see the sea lions; so it&apos;s a place to check out if you&apos;re in the area and want to visit."
2,"ro: Sometimes, there are sea lions.

Cons: There aren&apos;t always sea lions.

Neutral: lots of kitschy, touristy shops, and a giant Christmas tree to remind east coasters that it is, in fact, the holiday season.

Pier 39 was recommended to me by a friend from the Bay Area, specifically for the sea lions. It delivered in spades. Or in sea lions.

Other than that, unless you&apos;re looking for chain food and little knick knacks or souvenirs, there&apos;s not a ton to do here as an adult with a proclivity for biking around and day drinking. This place is probably a lot more fun if you have kids.

For real, though, awesome with the sea lions."
3,"I like the area there are decent price places to buy things and better food off the pier, but its such a nice place to walk around with a friend and look at the bridge or sunset beautifully. The only thing that detered me from fully enjoying was the large amount of people not wearing mask and theres people coughing here and there. It makes me think damn, people really don&apos;t care about covid huh."
5,This is a great here with a lot of fun activities restaurants food bars things to see when you&apos;re in San Francisco. We had a great time and went multiple nights to see all the different things that this pier has to offer. We had a good time and if we go back we will definitely visit this place again
5,"Dear Cody,

Christmas sure is different this year. The Christmas feeling is really hard to explain, and apparently, just as hard to create. Your mom and I watched three Christmas movies and listened to my elite Spotify Christmas playlist on repeat, but are still nowhere close to &quot;feeling that gingerbread feeling&quot;. But it&apos;s your first Christmas and I want you to look back at these letters and find a Christmas Special Episode in there. So as your Dad, I&apos;ll try to describe Christmas at Pier 39.

Every year, there would be a sound system that blasts Mariah Carey&apos;s voice far and wide, so you would hear the Christmas spirit before you even see that giant tree. The tree is wrapped in ribbon and candy lights. From afar, it&apos;s really majestic -- a towering tree with twinkling lights in a dark velvet sky. Up close, you would have to crane your neck to see the entire tree. All around you are other Christmas sounds competing with Mariah for your ears&apos; attention. Most people, probably like you when you grow up, enjoy hearing laughter and other forms of holiday cheer. Your dad is weird. I like hearing that swishing noise when those puffy North Face shuffle against those winter Patagonias. I also like hearing that quick crinkle when someone holds their laminated shopping bag too close to their legs, and the bag crinkles a bit when it swings against the back of their legs. All that, plus our face being numbing cold whilst the rest of our body feels cozy warm, is my best attempt at describing what Christmas feels like.

We actually packed your diaper bag and made a visit to Pier 39 a couple weeks ago. No giant tree this year, no Mariah Carey&apos;s voice, and instead of a swarm of shoppers in North Face carrying laminated shopping bags, there were just a few stray tourists doing some sightseeing in a pandemic ghost-town that was surprising warm for a December. Rather disappointed, we drove home, you drank milk, and I thought about Christmas for the next few days.

I thought about how my Christmas would look just like Pier 39 as I&apos;ve described it. And I thought about how you&apos;ve never even seen Pier 39 like that. And how maybe my perception of a missing Christmas may have been mistakenly projected on you. Perhaps inside that little Cody mind, you&apos;ve absolutely enjoyed this holiday season. The cold breeze from the quiet pier brushing against your face, rocking in the baby car seat listening to Dad&apos;s carefully selected playlist, cuddling with mom while the family watches Home Alone, and laying by the small living room tree with a clean diaper and a belly full of milk.

When you grow up, maybe you&apos;ll discover that unlike your dad, that you prefer a nice, quiet Christmas. That maybe somewhere in your baby memory, you&apos;ll remember that it&apos;s family that gives you that gingerbread feeling. Merry Christmas, Cody.

Love,
Dad"
1,"Being a tourist in San Fransisco almost everyone recommended that we visit Pier 39. 

So, we checked it out and were very disappointedd to find that this was essentially a boardwalk with commercial shops and restaurants. I wasn&apos;t noticing the local flavor that we were promised 

It was getting dark so we decided to call an Uber and leave, as we were walking a group of men were whistling at us and telling us to come over to them. We quickly got to a street light and waitedd patiently for our Uber. There was no law enforcement or security around to monitor behavior and honestly that experience was enough for us to not go back.  Be careful during sunset at this pier."
1,"Do NOT shop at Aleenk Technology 

This store is a scam, you may walk in for a phone case or charger of some sort and they will end up selling you overpriced merchandise and adding &quot;free&quot; items. There have been many sorts of complaints from their previous location and PIER 39 should be ashamed in having a vendor such as them at there location and taking advantage of many tourists. They have a no return policy and all the items are outdated.  Your better of ordering via amazon."
4,"Pier 39 is Tourist Central in San Francisco!!  So many restaurants, so many Bars, just food galore!!  

So many shops selling a little bit of everything, this place is almost always crowded!!

Living in the Bay Area, I&apos;ve been here so many times I can&apos;t remember, staycations or just to hang out.  I almost always bring out of town visitors here to see the city.

I always seem to discover new things in this area.  The sea lions are always a crowd favorite.  If you want to go to Alcatraz or any kind of boat tour, this is the starting point. 

Always lots to do here!!"
4,"Let me tell you a little about it!

I live only a couple of blocks from Pier 39 and I regularly visit when I go for a leisurely early evening walk. Despite having been there tens if not hundreds of times over the years, I never get tired it! 

The pier has a few decades of history. Here is a the very summarized version:

The construction on Pier 39 first began sometime in 1977 and was completed in late 1978. The pier&apos;s attractions include stores, restaurants and street performers. Pier Market Seafood Restaurant, Eagle Cafe and Swiss Louis Italian &amp; Seafood Restaurant are three of the originals that are still operating.

One of the most popular attractions of Pier 39 are the sea lions. The sea lions first began arriving at the pier in January 1990, and immediately began drawing attention. The sea lion population grew over the years and reached a peak number at around 1700  in November 2009. The city of San Francisco added a few new floats to the docks to make more room for the bulky lions. These days their numbers are far less than 1700, but they still attract a lot of attention from visitors."
5,"The kids love coming here and watching the sea lions. They are a very interesting creature--you could probably write a book about animal behavior just standing there and watching them on the barges. The rest of Pier 39 is super touristy but there are some good restaurants. The chocolate store is pretty amazing and has something for every kind of chocolate craving. 
Parking in the Pier 39 garage is very expensive. Buy parking online instead of just driving in. It will save you around $30 if you stay for more than a few hours."
5,"Before we actually made it back to the car we stopped at Pier 39 again and took some pictures of the girls with the Christmas tree. I love coming in December to Frisco they always decorate the Pier nicely late in November just in time for Christmas. 

Yes it&apos;s a tourist trap, everybody knows this. But no matter where you go here the prices are going to be steep. The girls do love to come and eat at Wipeout though lol. I can&apos;t believe the NFL store is gone though, I teared up a little. My sister and I were planning on doing some shopping after lunch lol and we noticed the sign was gone! But the important thing is the girls had fun and they were able to get their churros at noon way before it started raining lol."
4,"Always a fun experience to share with visiting family or friends. Also good to walk and enjoy on one&apos;s own. Today was visiting family. The weather was nice, even with the expected bay breeze to keep things a slightly chilly.

The 30 Years Sea Lion statues in different areas was a nice tough today. Each are individually decorated (like one has seen before with cows and horses). Many of these plaster artworks were throughout the pier today...as were the Sea Lions live and sunning themselves on the Bay.

Love seeing all the store areas filled and even mid-day on Friday, lots of people enjoying all there is to do here."
5,"Can you say pier 39 and not smile....just a short walk from pier 33 (Alcatraz dock) so much to do here.  Many street vendors with assorted food. Restaurants are everywhere...big box and one offs. Souvenirs if you&apos;re looking. 

This is where you find all the seal lions playing on the floating docks.  Also a few one man bands. Cool place to hang and see the marina. Hop on hop off stops here."
4,"We came here for the seals and that&apos;s really the best part. 

Walk down to the end of the pier to see all of the seals hanging out on the docks. 

We also walked through the shops in the pier. This wasn&apos;t really our scene though. It was crowded and the restaurants all felt like chains. The shops were all touristy as well. 

We didn&apos;t spend much time here, but I do think it&apos;s worth a quick stop to see the seals."
5,"Tourist trap for sure! In addition to great eateries, there are lots of souvenir shops and plenty of tours to get a scenic view of the bay. I had to go there after my movie because I was getting Christmas gifts! Actually I had the day off on Saturday so it was nice! 

Looks like their Christmas tree is up again. But that&apos;s not the only exciting thing there they have fun rides and other movie type attractions there. Make sure you bundle up this time of year as it gets super chilly!

P.S If you like video games and food - I highly suggest Players Bar - A great treat inside Pier 39!"
5,"The Pier is always the best! For several years, the fam and I would attend, but we stopped frequenting the Pier because it had gotten boring, drab, and tad overrated with the same boring stores and eateries. So after talking to a friend and discovering that things had shifted a bit, we checked it out tonight and it was a blast! Some stores had moved and expanded, we found parking (pure luck), and we had a great dinner at the Chart House. Normally we have to head to Monterey for the Chart House menu but tonight we experienced them at the Pier. It was a great switch up. 

The Pier was poppin&apos; tonight! 

We&apos;ll be back sooner than later...."
