5,"Omg LYC has done such a fabulous job adapting to the pandemic, huge kudos to them!
The fat rice noodles (housemade bacon &amp; spam, napa cabbage, oyster sauce, fermented black bean and chili) are invariably comforting and a great pairing with their roasted brussels sprouts salad that uses grapefruit, red cabbage, red boat, citrus kosho, peanuts and mint. 
The salad is well-balanced, and it&apos;s nice to have a brussels sprouts dish that isn&apos;t just a teeny variation from every brussels sprouts item ever.
Also recommend the chili honey opah, shrimp fritters and mushroom crispy rice. Basically anything they do. :)
The chef owner has fused heritage (Hawaiian Chinese and Indian), and mines all of that complexity and beauty to give you dishes you can only find at his place. Yum love."
5,"We have been fortunate to enjoy dining at Liholiho Yacht Club in person pre-pandemic and LOVE Chef Ravi&apos;s ono grinds EVEN MORE now as the Bay Area has been under quarantine since March. 

My Family splurged and treated ourselves to LYC&apos;s Christmas Feast and NYE Pupu box sets and could not have been more delighted - premium locally sourced ingredients, innovative Asian Hawaiian flavors, superb preparation, and generous portions - everything was simply FANTASTIC

Thank you Chef Ravi and Team Liholiho for being such a bright happy highlight during such hard miserable times, you bring the aloha to us all! mahalo 

GET JAG

PS - really hoping for Chinese New Year and Valentine&apos;s Day boxed sets - hint hint, wink wink! I would GLADLY preorder both NOW :-)"
5,"For #ThankYouThursday, it goes to Liholiho Yacht Club.  Luckily I was able to return twice to dine-in since my last review for our faves, the tuna belly misoyaki a few days after it hit the menu and again 2 months later when I finally went for that whole lobster for my belated birthday with a friend who is not allergic to shellfish.  It is those memories that held me over when SIP hit and Liholiho closed understandably when ohana needed to come first.  

When they were finally comfortable enough to open for takeout in June, you bet I hightailed it over to SF the first weekend it opened so I can get a taste of Chef Ravi&apos;s cooking yet again.  Opening with a very limited menu, we got the tuna poke bowls which is that delicious poke that was served on nori chips during dine-in but this time also with rice to make it a hearty lunch and the best car lunch.  Packed perfectly to travel home too as the nori chips are in a separate paper bag and the cold poke in a separate container from the hot rice.  I will say it again, best poke outside of the islands that we ordered it every time we have returned.  We finally got to have that baked Hawai`i again that we were always too full for 8 of the 9 times we dined in.  As soon as that off-menu homemade spam I used to get for dine-in hit the menu in July, I ordered it right away too and yes have gotten that every time since.  I see a pattern here again where I can&apos;t help returning to my faves.  

The great thing about takeout is if you keep adding on to your faves, you don&apos;t have to cook dinner either like our last 2 visits where I finally tried their breakfast sando that if flip books were still a thing, would have its own flip book.  Nestled in that sando using Neighbor Bakehouse bread is housemade spam, egg, and cheese.  OMG!!  Since we were parked 1/2 a block down, I was so tempted to walk-up and get another.  But I did have a poke bowl, homemade spam, and pumpkin custard malasadas already so have to put it off to next time and with dinner options just hitting the menu with expanded hours added recently, you can bet we will be returning.  

If you ever wanted to try Chef Ravi&apos;s creations but never got a reservation, take this opportunity to do so and support them so they will still be around for us to dine in once again in the future.  

Mahalo Chef and Liholiho!"
4,"We ordered delivery from Liholiho for our anniversary.  While we enjoyed some dishes, others did not travel well.  Online ordering via Doordash was smooth, and the food arrived pretty warm.  

My husband and I had the following (it was more than enough food, and we have leftovers):

1) Fried chicken - decent, but saltier than we would have liked; I was not a fan of the blue cheese dip
2) Shrimp with vermicelli noodles - the noodles were flavorful, and the shrimp was good
3) Shortrib - disappointing - the meat was tough (I suspect this is not a dish that travels well; we live all the way across town in Bernal Heights)
4) Broccoli with cashews - delicious 
5) Baked Hawaii - pretty good
6) Jell-O shot - creative and fun

We ordered delivery via Doordash had a smooth online ordering and delivery experience.

For those ordering delivery during this time of Covid, keep in mind certain items may not travel as well as others. 

We are glad to see this restaurant offering delivery and takeout during this challenging time."
4,"I&apos;m a sucker for Asian Fusion/Hawaiian food, in part I think because I myself could and do sometimes identify as Asian Fusion. 

You can order online from the Liho website for pickup and in COVID times, they&apos;ve pivoted to offer large meal kits for you to take home and maybe do some partial cooking with, like their spam or some buns. 

I cracked and tried their breakfast sandwich which took over the timeline of my foodstagram for a while. It&apos;s large, Instagrammable, and delicious--loved the layers of crunch, the house made spam, egg, and the Fontina cheesiness in between some great bread.

I also liked their side of mochi cornbread, whose consistency is just what you&apos;d think it&apos;d be like. Very unique. Lastly, they have some nice cocktail drinks. I tried the pina colada slushie which is perfect for hot days (as well as cold ones when you need some Aloha spirit). I want to come back for their RBG drink because why not honor her by drinking? 

I think it&apos;s so cool how they&apos;ve adapted to current events with new menu items for home and creative drinks. I will be back!"
4,"I came here after an amazing Hamilton Musical and wanted to end the night with something special! And boy this place did not disappoint. =) I did make dinner reservations, but ended up still waiting about 30-40 minutes. 

Service: 
The service was phenomenal. Everyone was professional and attentive. Even if the staff that wasn&apos;t assigned to our table or anything would check up on us. I was accidentally staring off in to space and the staff came to check on me (oops haha) 

Food: 
Steam Bun - The meat to bun ratio was a little off. But the flavors were decent. I&apos;ll have to admit, this wasn&apos;t my favorite dish although everyone raves about it. 
Beef Ribs - Fall off the bones delicious! The sauce the star of this dish though as the flavor went really well with the fried rice. 
Spam Fried Rice - I thought this was a little too salty for my opinion, but my dinner mate loved it. The rice was cooked perfect (not too soft, not too hard) so it gave it the perfect texture. 

Overall: 
I would definitely give this place a try!"
4,"I&apos;ve had Liholiho before, while dine-in was still available, and I loved it! I thought the prices were reasonable for the quality and creativity of the food.

The takeout options looked interesting, and because of positive past experiences, I decided to go for it for a COVID-friendly date night. I ordered the fried chicken, fat rice noodles, cashew broccoli, baked Hawaii for dessert, and the jello shots.

Fried chicken--this was main course of the day. Instead of bone-in fried chicken, these were instead prepared in a sort of karaage style so they were extremely easy to eat. They were really flavorful &amp; delicious, but soo rich, so I appreciated the addition of pickled carrots to cut through the fattiness. 

Fat rice noodles--standard dry rice noodle dish, but with a nice fermented flavor from the black bean sauce. A touch of spice but definitely not overwhelming, nor was it the main point of the noodles. Kind of like a good supporting role in the entire meal. 

Cashew broccoli--SO GOOD. I always love Liholiho&apos;s veggie dishes, and this one didn&apos;t disappoint. The broccoli was sitting in the sauce for a while, but even then there was a good amount of crisp/crunch to it and a super roasty flavor. Would definitely get this again.

Baked Hawaii--put this in the freezer the second you get home, and then take it out to defrost a little 10 minutes before you eat it! This is really delicious and a must-order. A little sad that I didn&apos;t get to try the smores malasadas, but the chocolate cake at the bottom of this + the perfect meringue made up for it.

Shots--these are strong so don&apos;t go in underestimating this lol. The booze flavor is real and I kind of wish there was more fruit flavor. But it gets the job done so I wouldn&apos;t complain.

Overall, I think if you&apos;re looking to celebrate a special occasion at home or just want to try their dinner takeout menu, it&apos;s so worth it! Will be back to try more of the menu items :)"
3,"With the lockdown orders still in place, we ordered take out from Liholiho. I really wanted to like this place since it&apos;s been on my list for a while now. We are visiting SF from LA and wanted to enjoy a nice dinner so decided on order a big feast.

We ordered four main dishes off their dinner menu including the teriyaki homemade spam, tuna poke with furikake rice, broccoli, and rice noodles. The flavors on these dishes were either too bland or salty and did not really go together. The spam, which we were interested to try, tasted like sausage but the texture was a lot tougher and not as juicy. For dessert, we ordered the baked hawaii which was super coconut-y and mediocre. 

I will give it to them for the presentation of the food and attempt at unique flavors but to me personally was not executed well. It could have been that take out was not as good as having it in person at the restaurant so will have to try going in once the pandemic is over."
4,"Taste: 4
Value: 4
Service: great

I&apos;ve always wanted to try this place but could never swing a convenient dinner reservation. So, we decided to give the take out options, and boy, did we try them!

The drinks - I got the 2 caffeinated beverages. The chai and the cold brew. Both are distinctly nutty due to the cashew nut milk, which worked more for the coffee than the chai. 

The sandwiches - the katsu sandwich was brilliant. Basically an Asian fusion BLT with Chinese bacon and fa fried green tomato. I loved it. The fish sandwich didn&apos;t feel as special.

The meat - I liked the fried chicken nuggets and corn. The sweet glaze finished on the crispy crunchy skin of the small pieces of chicken was perfect. The ribs were pretty delicious due to the perfect sesame-flavored bbq sauce. The bacon was way too fatty and gave us a bit of a stomach ache from all the grease. 

The dessert- baked Hawaii - such a great combination but what a small dish for that price. The mochi cake had the perfect sweetness and consistency. 

All in all, flavor profiles were good for most items, but the price seemed steep for this to be a regular spot. Probably would only order the katsu sandwich again and again."
5,"I ordered takeout from here. They recently started doing dinner which is a welcome addition to their menu.  Ordering via website was easy. However, there&apos;s no parking so I did have to circle and park 2 blocks away when picking up. They also offer delivery, but delivery prices were higher on some items -- understandable considering they get charged by the delivery service. 

We ordered:

Appetizers
* fried chicken: crunchy and traveled fine. There&apos;s some powder that&apos;s umami, that I can&apos;t quite place. Reminiscent or furakake?  Shrimp chips?
* poke bowl: yum though slightly warm from being packed with the other items

Mains
* beef short ribs: very juicy and tender! Though there&apos;s a good amount of fat around the edges that I trimmed off 
* teriyaki spam: also juicy and umami!  Hubby loves spam and this was a hit

Side
* fat noodle: really delicious. A surprising mix of textures and flavors!

Dessert
* baked Hawaiian: really delicious -- there&apos;s meringue, toffee, coconut. Felt tropical and sophisticated!
* coconut mochi: When I ate it cold, it was a bit too chewy and sweet. Once I warmed it up (10mjn @ 300 in toaster oven), it was amazing!!  Kind of reminiscent of creme brulee and egg tart and Hawaii! 

Drink
* Bakery Stout inspired by baked Hawaiian: sweet, fruity and rich stout. I&apos;m not sure I&apos;d get it again bc it was a bit strong/ intense, but I&apos;m glad to have tried it. 

It definitely brought a lovely Hawaiian vibe with it. 

They take these common dishes and elevate it somehow. Quite delightful and we look forward to having it again!"
5,"Deconstructed spam masubi. All time favorite. (Not on the menu anymore, but can still order! As of pre-pandemic) 

First time here was within the first months of opening and they had this really yummy fish collar bone dish as one of the specials , but no longer.

To be honest, I love ordering a lot of their appetizers more so than getting the entrees. The entrees are good, but when going with a group of friends it&apos;s nice to grab drinks and share an assortment to try it all. 

Pre-pandemic: reservations were always tough, with mostly seatings 8pm+. Hard for parking so would recommend getting dropped off. Coat check awesome (friend brought his $$$luggage after arriving from SFO and had no issues). Downstairs has/had Louie&apos;s Gen-Gen Room, another cocktail bar. Haven&apos;t had a chance to try it as we would usually have dinner and hop to go out, but definitely would want to go back once it&apos;s open again! 

Favs: 
- As mentioned before: deconstructed Spam Musubi (house made!)
-  Duck Liver Toast

Drinks: 
- The Other Barrell: bourbon, ginger, lemon 
- Pineapple Peat: scotch, pineapple, lemon 
- Surfer Rosa: hibiscus mezcal, lemon, soda"
4,"Ordered from here recently and picked up. Super easy to order and pick up. 

We ordered the following items: crispy fish sandwich, breakfast sandwich, &quot;off menu&quot; spam, fried chicken nuggs, coconut mochi, hand pie, and baked hawaii. 

everything was really good, super tasty and portions were very good as well. given the price, everything was either shareable or good for 2 servings. 

would definitely recommend!"
5,"Liholiho made the perfect Thanksgiving dinner box for us this year. It meant so much to my family to have all the traditional dishes there, cooked to perfection, in this otherwise crazy stressful time. 
Thank you, Liholiho team! Happy holidays!"
5,Chef Ravi is amazing and this place is definitely a gem of San Francisco. His creations are mind blowing and the place is awesome and waiting for this Covid restrictions to be over so that we can dine here soon. Wishing them all the luck.
5,"Wow! Love the ambience of this place. Surprisingly, great music was played the night we went which made for an even more enjoyable dinner. This place is always packed with reason. Food is great. Chefs are good. Fancy dishes and traditional Hawaiian dishes including a secret spam dish. Service is phenomenal and the energy in the restaurant is very positive and uplifting. Great for a first or nice date night. Highly recommend and would go back. 

Hidden: There&apos;s also an underground bar which is a nice place to get a drink after dinner."
3,"Update: 
Hi Ravi! Thank you for personally reaching out. While my heart goes out to you and your family during this time, I believe yelp is an open platform and my experience was before shelter in place. A quick google search shows Liholiho is a Hawaiian Eatery, which is why I made that assumption. Many of my friends love your restaurant and have bought gift cards to support Liholiho during this time. I have also spread the word that Liholiho is offering gift cards during this time. Again, wish you the best and hope you and your family are safe :)

By some miracle I got same week reservations at 5:15pm! 

I&apos;ve been trying to come here for 3 years and was ecstatic... only to be underwhelmed :( I didn&apos;t feel like this was a Hawaiian restaurant at all, more New American? Even Trailblazer Tavern felt more &quot;hawaiian&quot; than Liholiho. 

Service was frustrating. The waitress came over every 5 minutes to refill our already full glasses, in addition to folding our napkins every time someone got up from the table. I felt like I was on a date with me, my boyfriend, and the waitress. 

In addition, we over-ordered and asked for the desserts to go. When I got home, one of the desserts was missing. If you&apos;re going to charge me $13 for a dessert, the least you could do is pack it. 

Let&apos;s talk about food: 

Scallops &amp; Pork Belly- scallops were seared perfectly and pork belly was crisp. but the pork belly+sunchoke puree+pecans just coated my mouth in oil. desperately needed some acid to cut through the fat

Roasted Octopus &amp; Potatoes- favorite dish of the night. potatoes creamy and octopus tender. raisins brought sweetness to the dish, counteracted by brine from olives. 

Pork Chop- so. much. salt. the highlight of the dish were the pickled kumquats and jalapenos on top, but the butter cabbage was flavorless and the pork was SO salty my mouth actually hurt after eating a couple bites. 

Coconut Butter Mochi- was good but is not worth $12, standard butter mochi you can buy at a bakery or make at home. 

Pandan-Coconut Rice Pudding- loved this, but again, not worth $12. 

Overall, this wasn&apos;t a bad meal, but for all the hype and the price point, I will not be back."
5,"Liholiho knocked it out of the park today. Anyone else stress comfort eating during covid times, or is it just me? Anyway, I finally remembered to order and pick up before 3 pm today! 

We got the fried chicken nuggs with a side of jalapeño cornbread, the off menu spam with furikake rice, the hand pie and the grasshopper baked hawaii. Everything was super ono! While I was hoping to actually be in Hawaii with my family right now, the next best thing was eating everything!! 

Due to a small mishap, we also got a coconut mochi order. Unexpected service and amazing thoughtfulness. I had actually wanted to order it but thought 3 desserts seemed excessive. Thank you, universe. Really a class act to round out a perfect meal."
4,"I had a very enjoyable time at Liholiho Yacht Club! I came here for a cute date night, and I have to say this is such a beautiful location for that kind of occasion. When you first walk into the restaurant, it seems small with a busy bar at the front. However, once you walk to the back of the restaurant, you will pass the kitchen which is completely open with no walls or windows covering it. It&apos;s so cool that you get to see the chefs up close while they are preparing your food!

We were seated towards the back at a small table, and our waitress was super nice. They always come by to make sure you&apos;re satisfied with everything. 

Now onto the food... We got 4 things: the duck liver toast, the tuna belly salad, the beef tongue buns, and the grilled shortrib.

Duck liver toast - 4/5 The flavor combination for this is wonderful! It gets a little heavy if it&apos;s just 1-2 people eating it because the toast is so large but it&apos;s yummy nonetheless.

Beef tongue bun - 5/5 My favorite thing I had honestly. The beef tongue was super soft, almost melting in my mouth. The flavor of the kimchi, sauce, and poppy seed bun was phenomenal. 

Tuna belly salad - 3/5 This wasn&apos;t bad but I probably wouldn&apos;t get it again either. The tuna was soft and the salad was flavorful, but it didn&apos;t really stand out much.

Grilled shortrib - 3/5 This was not bad as well. The shortrib had a little bit too much fat on it for my liking. However, the escargot-bone marrow with potato on it was really good!

Overall, the food is delicious and the interior/service was top-notch. I&apos;d come here again in the near future for a fun date night to enjoy some yummy food!"
4,"This review is a little late (1.5 years to be exact) but glad the pics bring it all back.

Liho Liho is one of those places in SF that I had been eyeing for a while. The ambience, food, drinks, yelp reviews looked really legit - so what better time to go then on my birthday?

My best girls and I had an absolute blast. We were lucky enough to snag some seats (aka took over) the bar and I made everybody have a cocktail or two with me - or else.  We definitely drank a little too much, or at least I did.  The drinks were delicious and strong!

We ordered a variety of delicious food - the bone marrow dish was highly recommended and I thoroughly enjoyed it. One of my friends got a spam dish and it was delicious.  I couldn&apos;t remember the other dishes too well but I wasn&apos;t mad at any of them.

The ambiance was very posh, intimate, and the servers were really accommodating and fun - I would go back and resample the food!"
5,"Ever since I first saw a photo of the baked Hawai&apos;i ten(!) years ago, I had been wanting to come to Liholiho. And all of my dreams came true after finally eating here. All of them. 

From the service to the ambiance to the decor to the platings to the ridiculously good food, Liholiho is a treat you definitely want to partake in if you&apos;re so lucky to nab a reservation. Apparently the spots release on midnight a month before, so be sure to be on yo A game if you want to come. There are some people that try their luck at the open seating area, so that is an option as well.

The beef tongue Bao, (off menu) spam over furikake rice and baked Hawai&apos;i were off the chaaaarts good. The beef tongue sauce goes so well with kimchi and it&apos;s wrapped in a Bao that&apos;s covered in sesame. The Bao is exquisiteeee. The spam here isn&apos;t like your good ol&apos; can of spam. It almost tastes like a thicker and denser piece of really, really good ham. The baked Hawai&apos;i is a step up from your average lemon meringue pie. The crust on the bottom plus the fluffy vanilla pillow. Drool. Poke seaweed came in a close second (seaweed flavor is really delicious) followed by the octopus + sweet potato, coconut rice pudding (you&apos;d love this if you&apos;re a coconut fan), and then the grilled short rib + potato over bone marrow. Normally my rankings at restaurants go from excellent to meh, but honestly all of these dishes were delicious that you can&apos;t go wrong ordering any of them.

Service was amazingly amazing as well. Because we ordered so many appetizers, they came one after another almost just a couple of minutes after our previous dish got taken away. Our cups were never empty, and each of the servers frequently checked up on us. One of the best dining experiences I&apos;ve had in SF and the price isn&apos;t too ridiculously expensive either. I&apos;m certainly counting down the days until I can come here again (it&apos;ll definitely be less than 10 years!!"
