5,"This spot is one of my favorite places to get banh mi! Prior to COVID-19, the line was always out the door. With COVID-19, there&apos;s still a line ... just socially-distanced.

I appreciate this place is open really early in the morning, so you can satisfy your cravings at 8am. 

I&apos;ve tried to roast chicken, fanci pork, and roast pork. My favorite is still the roast chicken. 

The staff is really efficient. My go-to order is a roast chicken sandwich with a Vietnamese coffee! 

Note: When I was last there, they weren&apos;t able to offer coin change. However, since my banh mi and Vietnamese coffee were $9, that didn&apos;t personally impact me."
5,"I can&apos;t think of a single place in San Francisco that sells quality and filling bánh mì for only $4.50. 

In the era of COVID, customers queue up in a socially distant line and slide cash under the plexiglass barrier to pay for their sandwiches. The staff decked out in PPE were super efficient and assembled my roast pork bánh mì within minutes. It&apos;s a quick grab-and-go operation. 

For $4.50, you get a warm crunchy baguette generously stuffed with juicy roast pork, crisp pickled carrot and daikon, sliced jalapeño peppers, sprigs of cilantro, and creamy mayo dressing. I appreciate the warm, soft, and crunchy baguette because that&apos;s the foundation for making a good bánh mì.

Theoretically, you could split the bánh mì in half to share with a companion, but I gobbled this thick and juicy sandwich in 10 minutes. This is not a sandwich I want to share because it&apos;s all for me. My only regret is that I didn&apos;t buy more sandwiches. It&apos;s a memorable meal for lunch."
5,"My go-to cheap yet tasty and filling eat when I used to go to school in the area. Since Covid, I have not tasted the delicious and packed banh mi of Saigon Sandwich . However, I&apos;ve heard they are still operating (which is great, and I hope to support next time I&apos;m in the area). 

I&apos;ve only ever ordered the chicken banh mi because why change a thing when it&apos;s that good? The chicken banh mi is packed with a little-bigger-than-bite-sized pieces of marinated chicken, pickled carrots, cucumber, lots of cilantro, and jalapeño. It&apos;s filling, and for the price of $4 (pricing pre-Covid), it is perfect.  

They usually have a line going out the door (at least pre-Covid with the usual lunch rush), but the line goes by fairly quickly. The staff work efficiently! 

BOTTOM LINE: Cheapest place in the city for a filling meal! But make sure you have cash."
5,"This spot is best vietnamese Banmi sandwich in SF Area.

Quality of meat and sauce...wow and also price....is more incredible. Place is small but sales volume must be high. Stopped by Sunday morning and had 6 customers for wait. Amazing! You should try."
4,"Still one of my favorite banh mi spots in the city! They have a pretty limited menu with a few options or so, but my go-to,  ALWAYS, is the combo. I cannot eat a banh mi without pâté and luckily, the combo covers all the bases of ham, fancy pork, and pâté. One of these days, I&apos;ll get around to trying some of their other menu items. Size is relatively moderate for 1, and for $5.50, I really can&apos;t complain. This is probably one of the few authentic banh mi places left that don&apos;t charge $8+ for one of these sammies. 

The also sell a small array of drinks and snacks (shrimp chips!) to go with your meal. But otherwise, Saigon Sandwich is pretty much your simple, tried and true banh mi spots. My only qualm is the neighborhood, but I also think that&apos;s one of the reasons why they don&apos;t open late. Pretty small establishment, and they&apos;re not allowing more that 2-3 customers in at a time during Covid, so be prepared for a bit of a lunchtime wait. But the line does move FAST, probably due to them having a simple and limited OG menu."
4,"I&apos;ve been on the search for some good banh mi after being spoiled by amazing ones from Philly Chinatown growing up. I heard this place is supposed to have some of the best in SF and came to check it out.

After reading some reviews online, I decided to call and place an order ahead in case the line got too long. Note that it&apos;s CASH ONLY too! We ended up getting 2 cha lua (fanci pork), 1 xiu mai (Vietnamese meatball) and 1 special combination. My favorite was the special because of the generous amount of pate, but the xiu mai was a close second.

Overall, flavors are amazing and it tastes like an authentic Banh mi for a super fair price. However the bread felt a bit dry and stale. I was hoping for more of a crispy bread on the outside that is still chewy and not dry on the inside (haha if only it was that easy right??). The sauces that are added also taste delicious but it&apos;s not evenly spread across the bread so some bites will taste drier or less flavorful than others. Definitely a win for my first Banh mi experience in SF though."
5,"Best banh mis in SF. 

Used to be $3 each a few years back, currently they&apos;re $4.5 each which is still affordable but takes away from the &quot;wow this is too good to be this cheap&quot; factor haha. I ordered the roast chicken and roast pork this time and both were exceptional. Each bite is super flavorful. Your choice of well seasoned protein + a little heat from the jalapenos balanced out with the refreshing and crunchy pickled carrots/daikon. I&apos;m usually pretty stuffed after eating one full sandwich but if you&apos;re less hungry then it&apos;d be possible to share 1 sandwich between 2 people. But the banh mis are so good I&apos;d advise you to get your own :)"
2,"Pretty disappointed of Saigon Sandwiches. If you&apos;re born and raised in SF, you know the authenticity of Saigon Sandwich. We used to have these when we were little kids, it was the best field trip lunch to bring. But I feel like that ship has sailed for me. 

Parking - meter parking. 
*Warning - this is located in the heart of the tenderloin. Parking is around druggies, and homeless, and don&apos;t be surprise if you see needles on the floor. I would call ahead and order to avoid any wait time in this area. You may not feel safe. 

Price - it&apos;s still under $6 per sandwich which you probably can&apos;t get anywhere in the city. 

Taste - I got 3 special combo for two of my other friends. My special combo was just okay. The jalapeños weren&apos;t spicy. They have an unique mayo(?) sauce that just wasn&apos;t my liking. My buddy didn&apos;t like the sauce and said the bread was just alright. 

Overall, I won&apos;t come back because it&apos;s pretty far away from me, parking sucks, and banh mi was meh."
5,"Cheap, filling, and authentic sandwiches.  I&apos;ve never been a huge fan of banh mi or other Vietnamese foods, but this place is unique.  My mum confirmed that these sandwiches were like the ones she grew up with in Vietnam, and for some reason, the seasoning or meats they use for their sandwiches are better (to me) than Lee&apos;s or other mom and pop shops.  Go figure.

Anyways, I get the cha lua and pate sandwich.  All sandwiches come with pickled onions and carrots, cilantro, a Mayo mix, and jalapeños.  I always get extra jalapeños because 9/10 times, it&apos;s just not spicy enough for me.

The roasted pork sandwich (hot) is also good, but a tad dry.  The special combination is similar to the sandwich I get, but it has too much meat.  Finally, the meatball sandwich (hot) is also good.  

It&apos;s all cash and prices were raised 50 cents.  Most sandwiches are between $4 to $5.50. They also sell snacks, Vietnamese yogurt, Vietnamese coffee (highly recommended), che (desserts), and other Vietnamese cakes.  Either way, you can definitely find something here to try out!"
4,"Saigon Sandwich, I&apos;ve heard so much about you! Located in the Tenderloin area, this little shop sells Vietnamese sandwiches (banh mi) for a really great price of $4.50! Before you go, remember that this is a CASH ONLY business so remember to bring the paper! Luckily, there wasn&apos;t a line when I arrived late afternoon on a Saturday. I put in my order for a combo sandwich and a meatball pork sandwich and they were made fresh right when I ordered. They were ready very quickly.

The sandwiches were stuffed! The bread was crisp and didn&apos;t shred up my gums. They were very generous with the pate and spreads and the meat was plentiful. The meatball sandwich was a bit on the salty side, though. Nonetheless, both sandwiches were delicious and very filling for a wonderful price! If I could, I&apos;d order every sandwich from the menu and try each one of them!"
5,"Amazing Vietnamese spots. A shady location and crappy setup, very mom and pop shop. But the food is amazing. Their combo is the most recommended, roast pork follows. You can&apos;t really go wrong with any of the choices though."
5,"I&apos;m a bit late on this review but this is one of my favorite places ever. 

When I think about the time I spent in SF, I always think of Saigon Sandwich. I was fortunate enough to live around the corner and be a block away from a delicious Bahn Mi, and even made it a habit to get my morning coffee here. 

Thank you Saigon Sandwich, I will always remember you!"
5,"My fav Vietnamese sandwich in the city, partially because the roasted chicken is delicious and partially because they&apos;re ONLY $4!!! Saigon Sandwich is a staple in my lunch routine since I work in the area. You can always depend on it for juicy chicken, pickled veggies, and crunchy yet soft bread that&apos;ll definitely cut up the roof of your mouth. But it&apos;s worth it!

It&apos;s a mom-and-pop, no frills shop, cash only! There will most likely be a line, but it goes by fast."
3,"A small little shop that makes Banh Mi sandwiches super quick. They aren&apos;t the friendliest, there is no where to sit, and it&apos;s a bit run down but you&apos;re in and out really fast and the sandwich is good for the price. 

The one thing that bothers me is that they tell you they don&apos;t have change for whatever bill you give them so they give you a rice crispy or whatever little dessert snack as a &quot;sorry&quot;. They say this every time to pocket the extra change...she kept my extra $5. Of course they have change...they only take cash! I just find it a bit shady.

I won&apos;t go out of my way to buy from here as it&apos;s super hard to find parking."
4,"Honestly, what could I possible say or add that has&apos;t already been said in the literal thousands of reviews before mine?  I mean, this place is like an institution - THE place to get banh mi sandwiches in the Tenderloin...and possibly even the entire city.  Yet, here I am, adding yet another positive review to Saigon Sandwich&apos;s collection, so you&apos;ll have to excuse me if this sounds oddly similar to what so many others have already said.  Not that I&apos;m sorry; having finally made my way here after all of these years, you can&apos;t even imagine how happy I am to finally scratch this place off my list of bookmarks!

Now, given how my go-to for banh mi (Que Huong) has always more than satisfied my cravings, as well as the fact that I&apos;m just not that fond of the Tenderloin, I&apos;ve never felt much urgency to come down here.  However, that doesn&apos;t mean I was any less excited as I walked through the door!  Stepping inside, I wasn&apos;t surprised to see that Saigon Sandwich was so small, but I never realized just how modest the menu was.  In all, they have about a half dozen varieties of banh mis...and that&apos;s about it, save for all of the different snacks and candies laid out on their counter.  Not that anything else is really needed!

-- BANH MI THIT CHA PATE - Special Combination with Ham, Fancy Pork, and Pate)...$5.50

I&apos;ve had mixed experiences with &quot;special combo&quot; banh mis (the standard one every place has), but this one was solid.  The fancy pork was fine, and I liked the ham, but the pate was the highlight for me - not overly fatty and straight up delicious.

-- BANH MI THIT - Roast Pork...$4.50
(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/saigon-sandwich-san-francisco?select=nQ-R8W8Dnp8HOUD9GZIG6A)
I usually love pork banh mi sandwiches, but this one was just okay.  The bread (on all three) was soft, and I liked the seasoning on the meat, but the pork felt a little dry to me.  At least the pate I added helped a bit.

-- BANH MI GA - Roast Chicken...$4.50
(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/saigon-sandwich-san-francisco?select=l69r9t00GWQDkrwgqd3rvA)
Of the bunch, this was my favorite.  The chicken was super moist and it packed a punch of flavor - just the right amount of lemongrass.  A bit more marinade on the chicken might have been nice, but this was still terrific.

While I&apos;m obviously ecstatic to have finally made my way here, and even though Saigon Sandwich didn&apos;t disappoint in the least, I&apos;d be lying if I said I was as enamored by this place as so many others have been before me.  Perhaps it&apos;d be different if I lived closer to the Tenderloin or came out here more often than I do, but, for me, Que Huong is still tops in SF for me thanks to their far more convenient location, similar prices, and comparably tasty, if not better, food.  Not that I would ever say no if someone offered to pick up one of these for me, especially a Xiu Mai (Meatball) banh mi so I can check that out.  Just sayin&apos;..."
4,"I hadn&apos;t eaten a bahn mi in several months and was craving a good one. Friends recommended this place to me and I wasn&apos;t disappointed! On this Sunday morning, I got there early to have an early picnic lunch in Golden Gate Park and there was already a line out the door! This place is a total hole in the wall but don&apos;t let the looks fool ya because it&apos;s so good! It&apos;s cash only of course and the 2 ladies were cranking out those sandwiches like a well oiled machine! The prices are very reasonable especially for the Bay and the amount of meat they give. One friend complained they give too much meat which is heresy to me!  The bread is very light. I wish it was a bit crunchier and that the veggies were a bit more pickled. But these are still very yummy! We had the roast pork and special combo with pate. Both were winners!"
5,"I&apos;ve been coming here since I was a little girl. When my family lived about 5 blocks away, this was my parents&apos; go-to place to order sandwiches for my school field trips and/or weekend lunches. I ALWAYS ask for the special combo, which is now priced at $5.50 (50 cent increase since Covid-19 happened).

The size of the sandwich hasn&apos;t changed. It is HUGE. It is stuffed with fresh ingredients. The meat is always flavorful, the carrots are pickled with the perfect amount of sweetness (I always ask for extra!), the sliced jalapeños still have seeds attached to them (be careful -- it&apos;s dangerously spicy), and the mayonnaise and pate smear is super generous. Every bite is heavenly!

Tip: The sandwiches are not cut in half. If you want your sandwich(es) cut in half, remember to kindly ask!"
5,"CHEAP and Delicious banh mi! Saigon sandwich is my go to lunch spot when I use to work around nearby. Its a quick grab thats more delicious than all these $30 meals around the city. I consider Saigon Sandwich to be the BEST Vietnamese sandwich around San Francisco.

5,"Sorry for the delayed comments and appreciation for the ladies all these years, at least 15 if not 20 years making my Combination Sandwiches &quot; No Toast &quot;, my sandwich go to place in SF every time I ride the GG Bridge to the Marin Headlands, the price, the size, the filling are the best bang for your bucks. I love the pate and of course the speedy ladies, always helpful and separate the veggies when they notice I&apos;m getting xtra for later after the ride, so bread won&apos;t get soggy. 
Call ahead, pre order and all you have to worry is the parking, construction across the street making Larkin a little tough to find parking."
5,"Tucked away in the gritty Tenderloin district of SF is this absolute diamond in the rough. Saigon sandwich has a very simple menu and their sandwiches are extremely fair priced ($4.50 each). They are cash only, so come prepared. 

I ordered the grilled chicken Banh Mi and my wife the grilled pork Banh Mi and they were SO DELICIOUS!! The baguette was actually fresh, it was LOADED WITH MEAT that has so much flavor! They had the perfect ratio of veggies as well! 

It is no wonder why this spot had so many perfect reviews. We will go out of our way to enjoy a sandwich here again"
