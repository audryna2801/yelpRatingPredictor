5,"Believe it or not, this was my first time trying Golden Boys. I have heard nothing but good things about this place. I&apos;ve been meaning to try them for the longest time and so happy I finally had the opportunity to. Because of the pandemic, they are only taking orders for sheet pizzas instead of per slice but I didn&apos;t mind that one bit! Leftover Golden Boys pizza for days is just as yummy! 

By the way, even though they are only taking half sheet/full sheet orders, you can mix and match the flavors and toppings! I found it most efficient to call in to order ahead to save the wait time.

So I decided to get the best of both worlds and picked their best seller - half sheet Clam/Garlic and half sheet Combo. nomnomnom... 
Love the crust, the clams, the combo, just everything about their pizza. I&apos;m glad I got half sheet and not just a couple slices. They are so generous with the toppings, and because it&apos;s a square type pizza, there&apos;s no dry, topping-less crust!"
5,"Garlic Clam Pizza.. is the pizza... for you and meeeee! (Only Spongebob fans will get this reference.) ;)

My first time having Golden Boy Pizza dates back to 2018. Ever since, no other pizza in the city was able to make my tastebuds dance like what GB pizza did. And as a special reward for myself, I was able to negotiate a half sheet pizza in exchange for a birthday cake this year. :&apos;) 

Btw, the service was great! Felt very welcome through the phone and in-person pick up. Recommended to place an order ahead of time. You already know I&apos;ll be coming back for more!"
5,"It is hard to have pizza from other pizza places around us (we live in San Jose) and not feel disappointed. Golden boy pizza is just that good. 

Love the crust, the topping, the cheese and the combination of them. I am lactose-intolerant but I would get my lactaid pills and eat their combo pizza. And these pizzas really hold for reheating, even after a couple days--actually I think they could be slightly more tastier after reheating. And their pizza is in squares--you cannot believe how much I love those, each bite is a perfect balance of dough, meat and veggies.

During the pandemic they only sell 1/2 sheet and above, but why wouldn&apos;t we get that anyways--talking about the golden boy pizza that lasts for the couple lunches during the early week, makes work feel less miserable!

I am actually not too much a fan of their garlic clam pizza. Pepperoni is okay but my favorite is the combo. Their veggies are roasted so perfectly--the crunchiest zucchini so it is always our top choice. Have fun eating the best pizza in the Bay Area!"
5,"Golden Boy has a special place in my heart and I&apos;m strangely connected to this place. I came here the first time partying in the city as a college student. Then years later when I decided to move into the city, I realized it was near my apt, so it was my first meal as a sf resident. I&apos;ve come here after parties, late nights out, work events, and even to cater any football parties at my apartment. I even ended up here with my girlfriend when we were on our first date (we grabbed drinks elsewhere and made a pit stop here). Also it was my last meal as a North Beach resident when I moved elsewhere in the city. So why do I keep coming back here?

It&apos;s just consistently delicious. I know people love coming here late at night, but it&apos;s also great sober too. Get the combo and the garlic clam slices and thank me later."
5,"One thing I miss about working in SF is having close access to Golden Boys. 

Golden Boys, perhaps one of the best pizza joint&apos;s in SF. You can either eat this sober or drunk, either way it&apos;ll taste HELLA good.

There&apos;s nothing better than a slice of pizza that has a nice balanced with fluffy Sicilian-style dough. Clam Garlic? I&apos;m sold.

Pizza Selections:
Cheese, Pepperoni, Sausage, Clam Garlic, Pesto and Combo. (Most slices are $4.25 each, well worth the $ and it&apos;s CASH ONLY!"
5,"I&apos;m into fitness... fitness the whole pizza into my mouth! I can eat an endless amount of slices of Golden Boy Pizza, which my close friend and I might have already done...

The quality and flavor is superb! The pizzas are so fresh, rich, and delicious. The best 5 pounds I&apos;ve ever gained. 

I&apos;ve already tried the combo, the pepperoni, and the clam pesto with garlic. All are extremely flavorful and super filling! I personally liked the pepperoni best. The clam pesto was really good, but it&apos;s definitely an acquired taste so you have to like clams and you have to like pesto. 

It takes a few minutes so just make sure to order ahead. The location is around Little Italy in SF, so know that parking isn&apos;t the easiest and it tends to get pretty crowded. 

If you haven&apos;t tried this place, grab some beer or wine and go try it already! Sooo gooood."
4,"As I write this review, the sweet aroma of garlic is emanating from my fingertips and erupting with each burp.

I blame Golden Boy Pizza&apos;s Garlic and Clam pizza for the predicament I find myself in.

I often consider myself more of a traditionalist when it comes to pizza.

Round pie,

Standard toppings like sausage, mushroom, red onions, olives,

Red sauce.  Maybe the occasional pesto.

You know, the basics.

Their pizza . . . 

square (no biggie.  I&apos;ve had square before),

garlic and clam (I like garlic and surprised I liked the clam as much I did),

cream sauce on foccacia (wow).

Good.  I mean really good.

And for the price?  Forget about it.

Buy a couple half sheets and savor all that Golden Boy Pizza has to offer.

I&apos;m just surprised they don&apos;t do Canadian bacon and pineapple.  Mahalo."
4,"More a 3.5, mostly bumped up because of the great service :)

At the open, we called (as the store requests) our order ahead and were given an estimate time for pick up, ours being just 15 min. At the time they give you you can go up to the counter and pay. We took the pizza to Washington Square (I&apos;d beware the flocks of birds).

I admit I wasn&apos;t impressed. The crunchy focaccia base and mild clam and garlic flavor are high points, but otherwise the pizza tasted very akin to...school pizza? The cheese was mild and very soft, so it didn&apos;t have a salty chew to it that I normally enjoy. 

However, the price is great for the amount of food you get; my two friends and I had enough left over for a fourth person."
5,"Golden Boy Pizza is nothing short of amazing and is further proof that square pizza is the way to go. 

I was in DTSF because I had a quick errand to run, and when I asked a friend about food I should grab, he mentioned Golden Boy. I was a bit reluctant because the last thing I&apos;d look for after a 60-mile drive from San Jose is pizza, but I&apos;m glad I made the order. 

After I did what I had to do, I called them up and ordered a large half-Combination, half-Garlic Clam. The trip up was a bit treacherous as you have to deal with the San Francisco hills and I hate all that, and the roads scarily narrowed on your way there. Luckily, I had my mom with me so I parked at a vacant lot across the street and had her wait in the car. 

Even after the hour it took to drive back home. Everything from the dough to the flavor was tremendous. Golden Boy is some of the best in the Bay Area and I found out they have one in San Mateo too so I look forward to trying that out."
5,"I absolutely love this place!! All the reviews are really worth the hype - one of the best pizza spots in the Bay. I&apos;ve been here a total of about three times now, and it still hits the spot. My go to order each time has been half a sheet of the clam garlic and half of pepperoni. The clam garlic flavor is definitely what they&apos;re known for. It&apos;s super unique, and you won&apos;t find it anywhere else! The clam, garlic, parsley, and cheese proportions are absolutely perfect. The most recent time I went, I actually added sausage to my pepperoni half sheet which was amazing. Honestly some people think that the pepperoni isn&apos;t super special, but I still love it and always get it. 

What I love about the pizza here is that the bread is baked to a golden perfection. The crust is the perfect crunch whereas the base of the pizza dough is baked to a delightful, soft and fluffy texture. The combination of the two different textures of the bread is to die for. Maybe that&apos;s why even just the pepperoni flavor at this shop is a must try! The price makes it all the more worth it. The amount you get for the price is a great deal, and a full sheet is super filling! I shared one total sheet with three others, and the amount was just right for us. 

I do recommend calling in beforehand instead of ordering at the window. When I went, we ordered at the window and had to wait/walk around the area for about 20 minutes. But if you order as you&apos;re driving over, you can time it better. Definitely worth the wait though even if you just order at the window!!"
5,"Finally got to try this place and it was worth the wait! 

Order only took 15 minutes to make.

We got a box of 12 square slices. Half pepperoni and half garlic and clam and both tasted great!

If you&apos;re ever near the North Beach neighborhood in The City try them out! 

Will definitely come back!"
5,"Sadly they do not offer slices at this time, but you will not regret ordering the entire sheet!

I ordered in person at 7:00pm on a Saturday night, and was told to pickup at 7:40pm. The wait is definitely worth it! 

The combo-sausage, pepperoni, tomato, onion, zucchini, cheese. It has the freshness and lightness from the veggies while having mouthfuls of meat.

My personal favorite is the garlic clam! It&apos;s like garlic bread, but with a super strong garlic and herb flavor. To be honest I&apos;m a tomato pie person for pizza, but would totally love this garlic clam pizza at any time!"
5,"Between North Beach and Jackson Square, there are tons of fantastic pizza spots. But you have to stop by Golden Boys if you&apos;re in the area, even if you&apos;ve already had pizza because they have clam pizza!

You can&apos;t really miss them, they have a huge neon light hand sign pointing at their establishment. As you approach the front (because there is always a line, especially at night) you will be teased by the fresh pans of square cut pizza from their window. Pro tip: a good time to make your selection. The inside is small, they do have bar seating and some areas to grab a beer and enjoy your square slice as long as you&apos;re okay with waiting. But most people take it to go. 

They&apos;re very popular at night as they open quite late. Very good pizza, the clam one is a must get. Don&apos;t freak if you don&apos;t see it on display as they churn then out like no tomorrow, piping hot. And also, CASH ONLY!"
3,"Popular pizza stop in San Francisco. Takeout only during the pandemic; no slices only selling whole sheet. Affordable. Creative toppings. Service can be friendlier. See below for more info: 

Popular pizza stop in San Francisco: 
As a born and raised San Franciscan, I have been hearing about Golden Boy left and right. The popular pizza stop line tends to be on lengthy side, especially on weekends prior to the pandemic with all of the surrounding night life. Golden Boy remains well-liked during the pandemic, the line is just shorter than usual. 

Takeout only during the pandemic; no slices only selling whole sheet:
Takeout only during the pandemic. Individual slices are no longer available. One can buy a sheet with two of your favorites. 

Affordable:
Prior to the pandemic, individual slides were a few dollars. Now one can get 12 square slices for less than $30 depending on the toppings with the clam &amp; garlic being the most pricey. These 12 slices are generous and can feed several. 

Creative toppings:  
The menu here is unique. I have had the veggie pesto as well as the clam &amp; garlic. The pesto pizza is on the tasty side while the clam &amp; garlic is satisfactory. The aesthetics of the square slices remind be of Prince Street Pizza in New York. 

Service can be friendlier: 
I have been here a few times and service was on the far end from friendly. While there is more to an experience than service, a good environment can take a meal to another level. 

Overall, Golden Boy is decent pizza, but I highly encourage y&apos;all to try for yourself!"
4,"FYI -- I took this photo during a visit prior to covid! However I was in the area on Sunday, so I walked by just to check out how they are operating now. Currently I believe single slices are not being sold, you can either purchase half a pizza or a full pizza. This is understandable considering the effect lockdowns have had on local restaurants and businesses. 

Typically you order at the window, and wait a few minutes while your pizza is placed in the oven to warm it up, and then it is placed into a box that is handed to you. 

Pictured are: clam, pesto veggie, and combo 

My favorite was the combo because there was a good portion of fresh veggies, pepperoni, sausage, &amp; cheese that all came together perfectly. The clam was interesting, and the fishiness didn&apos;t come through. However, I prefer the combo for the crunchy veggies &amp; meat topping. The veggie slice was similar to the combo, but without the meat.

There&apos;s usually a line on the street so be prepared to wait a bit!"
5,"They currently aren&apos;t selling single slices due to Covid. We called in for pickup and it was ready in about 25 min. The clam &amp; garlic is hella good y&apos;all. Heavy flavor and def a strong garlic taste, so if you&apos;re into that, you&apos;ll love it. The crust is fluffy, thick, and chewy all at the same time. Was surprised by the pricing too, a huge 2-flavor pizza for $25. The square cut slices is the best part"
4,So good!!! The crust the flavor. Everything is spot on. The price for half sheet is amazing! Cheaper than round table and all those other franchise spots.
4,"They are only selling half sheets during covid but it was perfect for a small group to split and you definitely get your bang for the buck!! We got the garlic &amp; clam and combo and both were amazing. The garlic is strong so you&apos;ve been warned but it really hits the spot and fills you up. 

The wait was about 20-30mins so I&apos;d recommend calling ahead. It was super easy to pick up our order and we ate it at the park down the road. Loved the experience and will definitely go back next time I&apos;m in town!"
5,"There are very few pizza places I like and Golden Boy is one of them. They use focaccia instead of regular pizza dough which makes their pizzas that much tastier. Their slices are cut into good sized squares slices. I&apos;m usually satisfied with two. You have to try their clam and garlic pizza, you won&apos;t regret it! Another one of my favorites is the pesto veggie. They load up each slice with lots of tomatoes, zucchini, peppers, mushrooms, and onions. I don&apos;t normally order veggie pizzas, I usually stick with pepperoni or combo but you have to try this one. There is also pepperoni on their menu and sausage. 

Usually there is a long line out the door so be prepared to wait. You can decide what you want to order since their pizzas are displayed in the window. They prepare your order in front of you and see them making pizzas. There are bar style seats in the front and back area, but I am not sure if you can dine in right now due to covid."
4,Tried their red and green pizza with only mushrooms. It was good but not the best. It was heavy and very bready. Pricing is fair. I recommend using the red pepper flakes to offset the heaviness.
