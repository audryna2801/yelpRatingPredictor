5,"I&apos;ll keep it short and brief.  Some of the best tacos and burritos in the city.

Nachos: skip during COVID.  It&apos;s not nacho cheese but rather shaved or string cheese that congeals.  

Shrimp in devil sauce (supposed to be spicy): it&apos;s interesting.  The sauce is made of tomatoes and it reminds me of marinara, but I would have preferred a dry rub shrimp, so while it&apos;s not bad, I personally don&apos;t recommend.  It&apos;s much wetter than I expected and I thought there were better and cheaper dishes on the menu. 

Regular carne asada tacos: Juicy, well-seasoned meat garnished with only cilantro, onions, and salsa.  So simple, but it packs a punch.  I could eat 5 of these, but realistically 2-3 are good.

Carne asada burrito: also well-seasoned, generous portions, and well-balanced.  It keeps well so it&apos;s a good dish to have for takeout or leftovers the next day.  The burrito filling has a bit of sour cream, avocado, lettuce, and meat.  Surprisingly, it doesn&apos;t become too soggy, so I eat half and save the rest for later.

Strawberry agua Fresca:  little pulps of strawberry make this a refreshing juice drink.  It tastes homemade, and it&apos;s not overly sweet.  Great with the dishes.

Service: you pay upfront and get the food to your table (when we had outdoor dining).  People there are nice and willing to answer inquiries.  Great Mexican food, reasonable prices, and decent service.  What more can you ask for?"
5,"I love burritos and I hadn&apos;t had a Mission style burrito in awhile.  I debated between El Farolito and La Taqueria.  I&apos;m glad I chose this place.

Covid has rampaged the interior.  There are dirty chairs and tables stacked in the rear.  It definitely could have used a good cleaning...

Carne Asada Burrito:  It was gigantic.  I got it with the Spiniach tortilla with everything in it.  The creaminess of the sour cream and beans, the heat from the salsa, the saltiness of the rice, and the flavor of the beef creates the perfect bite.  There&apos;s something unique and special about the Mission burrito that I can&apos;t find anywhere else.  Normally, I don&apos;t like rice in my burritos, with this exception.   One slight nit pick is that I wished there was a tad more meat.

Carne Asada Tacos:  I got them with sour cream and avocado.  Tasted good.  Good portion of meat on these.  No complaints.

Chips:  The one weak spot.  Not terrible, not great."
5,"BEST MEXICAN FOOD!!! BRING CASH! 

The only place where there is enough flavor that you do not need any sauce and there is a generous amount of meat + it is never dry! 

Whether you are taking a friend here, on a date, want a meal after clubbing, craving Mexican food, or whatever occasion.. you will be blown away with how much and how flavorful their quesadilla suiza is. It&apos;s only about $9 and I always have to share half with someone else or eat it as another meal. 

This is the only place where I don&apos;t have to really use the sauces that come with the entree because the carne Asada is already so flavorful and pungent. Everything is paired so well, and nothing overpowers anything. There is also a generous portion of meat and in general, a large meal for the price point. 

During Covid, I grabbed this as takeout and went over to Mission Dolores to enjoy this yummy meal! 

You can also request for spinach or whole wheat tortilla."
5,"this place is amazing especially late at night haha
we were at urban putt after an early dinner and decided to hit up this joint
amazing!
we had quesadilla, super nachos, and the super shrimp burrito with lengua
one of the few places in the bay with such a variety of meats
love this place"
4,"While visiting San Francisco I knew that I wanted to have a mission burrito, so after some research on Yelp, we decided on this place over the others mainly because of how many options they have for their burritos.

This is a very popular spot right on Mission Street, so parking sucks, as does trying to score a table.

Now on to the food. It was fantastic! It really reminds me of Freebirds, but with like 8 different choices of proteins. They are good sized, about the same as a Freebirds burrito. My husband got the super quesadilla which was also fantastic and huge. He could only eat half of it.

Sure, the long lines suck, the lack of availability tables suck, but the food is great and the prices are reasonable. It&apos;s all part of the experience. I&apos;ll come back every time I am in San Francisco without a doubt."
4,The serving size of a super burrito for $9 was crazy. I ordered the carne asada and it was ready within 5 min. Cash ONLY. The food is flavored well and I would just recommend to come hungry! There&apos;s an outdoor patio in the back with a restroom available as well.
4,"Oh my gosh, SO GOOD! the cronch and chew, melt-in-your-mouth filling, tortilla warmed to the perfect crisp, savory mouth-watering burrito.... Obviously it&apos;s not the healthiest thing in the world but after days of cooking and finally letting myself enjoy a to-go meal, this place hits the spot. Definitely recommend the carne asada, I cannot wait to be back!!! Service was really fast too!!"
4,"I really liked the super vegetarian burrito I got. It was HUGE. They loaded it with rice and beans. I liked that they didn&apos;t put hella lettuce how some places do, because it makes it really soggy. However, it tasted like something was missing. I think it definitely needed a lot of onion, tomato &amp; cilantro to balance the heaviness if the rice and beans. They also could have put a bit more sour cream. I really loved their salsas. Both the red &amp; green were really yummy and they were the perfect amount of heat to my liking."
4,"MEXICAN FOOD IN MISSION DISTRICT IS A MUST and the reviews/photos for this spot looked spectacular so I HAD to come!! First things first, definitely appreciated how COVID safe it was, with the employees requesting everyone wear a mask. 

Food was soooo yummy! They make it for your fresh on the spot and you don&apos;t have to wait very long. So many meat options that all seem super delicious!! I got the super burrito with al pastor and the super quesadilla with carne asada. I will say you should DEFINITELY get the quesadilla, it was loaded!! I already know that I want to come back hopefully post Covid so I can eat the food right when it&apos;s made instead of letting it sit until I get home."
5,Ok so no cap the super quesadilla it bomb.com I&apos;m not even exaggerating. This place is definitely a jewel. They only take cash FYI.
5,"Order the dam quesadilla suiza, y&apos;all sleep on that man. I&apos;m glad the picture on the page is that, bc it&apos;s fat. No rice, all cream, guac, meat, that thing smack. All in all tho, this place obviously a staple and always delivers quality"
4,"Yum Yum Yum! This is such a dank mexican spot!! I already know I&apos;ll be coming back cause I can&apos;t stop thinking about their super quesadilla!!!

This place is CASH ONLY so come prepared! Everything is fairly priced, and I didn&apos;t have to wait long for my food to be prepared. It was cool seeing my food being made fresh, you can see all their different meat options through the window!

The super quesadilla is a must-try. Loaded with meat cheese, tomatoes, and more. A lil greasy, but I loved it. So much good flavor. I also ordered the super burrito and it was HUGE. and delicious.  (though I preferred the quesadilla)"
5,"You guys know how everything tastes better when you&apos;re hungry? Well I was starving before I bought these burritos and it was love at first bite! 

This place is super generous with their meats, so their burritos were HUGE. They were ~$9 each, which is pretty affordable for the amount that you are getting. However, they only accept cash, so be prepared. I was full after eating only half of it! The burritos were very juicy  Everything was paired so well with each other and nothing was too overpowering. I also enjoyed putting the sauces that they provided on the burritos to add an extra kick."
4,"Most hole in the wall places do not meet health and safety standards so I was surprised this place scored 90 in Oct 2019. 
We seldom come to the Mish for food but feeling adventurous today, we found 1 hr parking and walked a block to get burrito. 

We had to pass the homeless and dudes with their masks pulled down to be chin guards, shouting and talking loudly to each other in front from McDonald&apos;s. 

We ordered 4 burritos with Blk beans, $7.75 each. 
There were floor markers for distancing, cash only and masks mandatory for service. Their staff are protected from you by a large plexiglass.

The grilled chicken a s carnitas burritos were good. I didn&apos;t get to try the carne asada. 
6 containers of salsa were enclosed - red and green salsa with the green being spicer. 

We hope to be back to try other items including tacos and enchiladas in the future."
3,"Ordered super quesadilla and chicken Burrito
In my opinion the overall food was too heavy on the stomach. However the taste and flavor were pretty good."
4,"Wow. Biked out here to get a burrito and it was 100% worth it. The beef tongue is flavorful and tender. We also got the flan, which was tasty. Probably the best Mexican food I&apos;ve tried in SF. 

My only gripe is that the pick-up experience could be better -- we still had to wait in the line for 10+ minutes despite the order already being ready. Wish we could have skipped the line or picked it up at the front instead, given that the line is indoors in a tight space."
5,"Sheeeeesh this place is perfect! Bomb food bomb salsa bomb drinks, what else do u need! I was visiting from SoCal and came across this place, really glad we stopped by, if ur in the area u gotta try this spot, we had an asada burrito and a asada quesadilla and a agua de sandilla, everything was so good!"
5,"UGHHHHH this place is so bomb!! I got the half carne asada half lengua super suiza burrito and it&apos;s sooo huge and dank. Love how affordable the prices still are! Downside is it&apos;s cash only, but that&apos;s when you know the place is really good!

I&apos;d say this is the best place to get Mexican food in the city! There&apos;s always a line, but it goes pretty fast."
5,"Visiting San Francisco from San Diego, I wanted to see if the infamous &quot;Mission Burrito&quot; compares at all to what I have back home.

I came to El Farolito because it seemed to be the best choice based on prior reviews and was in just about every listicle I could find addressing the subject, and it was also open on New Year&apos;s Day when I was looking for a burrito.

Here&apos;s what I found:
Articles promised me &quot;burritos the size of neck pillows,&quot; but the size was more moderate in actuality. Not at all disappointing, though, just not a brick-sized burrito like the ones I find in SD. 

However, the Super Burrito I had from El Farolito was great because it tasted *mexican*. There&apos;s a certain something about actual Mexican tacos/burritos that&apos;s absent from most of the Mexican food served in California, but Farolito has it. I don&apos;t know what I was expecting, but I was pleasantly surprised. I got two cups of salsa: one cup of salsa, and one cup of green sauce.

The place is cash only, ordering is simple and wait isn&apos;t too long."
5,El Farolito is one the best Mexican spots to hit up in the Mission. Their super quesadilla and al pastor tacos are so gooooood. I normally don&apos;t like getting quesadillas cause they&apos;re so easy to make but I could never make them as delicious as El Farlito&apos;s. They&apos;re always really crowded though so I recommend picking up to-go for sure.
