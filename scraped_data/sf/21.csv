5,"What can I possibly say that five thousand others haven&apos;t already?  Nopa practically owns upscale casual dining in Hayes Valley.  Could it be one of the best restaurants in San Fran?  Yes.  And it&apos;s not just a destination eatery; it has the wherewithal to offer the best of their menu for take-away/pick-up.  Nopa seems truly committed to its community and City.

Ace food and drinks-- from ending on dessert to beginning with cocktails.  My friend and I adore dining here.  Sunshine Fix aperol, angostura, gin, lemon is a modest but tart tangy elegant concoction.  Served in a wine glass and probably no more than five ounces, it could have used a larger pour but &apos;twas good.

Bar snack salad with citrus soft goat cheese and walnuts included what look and taste to be thin-sliced pickled kumquats plus suprèmed blood orange.  Just enough pickled stuff and chicory to qualify as salad.  Also had the nuts and dates, a mix of toasted buttered large pecans, almonds, walnuts, and dates roasted until soft.

Brisket came recommended from bartender on the appetiser menu, and indeed, it was outstanding.  Large slices of smoked beef with a thick peppercorn bark alongside vinegary roasted red potato pieces almost like marinated potato salad and pickled kohlrabe.

Pièce de resistance was the very thick cut country pork chop, extremely tender and massive enough for at least two eaters.  Best chop I&apos;ve had in awhile.  Topped with kale, a drizzle of kiwi cilantro salsa, side of delicata squash dressed and resting in celery root crème, the dish is absolutely worth ordering and immensely popular.

Dessert of warm sesame brioche beignets with vanilla bean crème anglaise was rich and fun though it lost some pizzazz after cooling off.  I loved the tart-sweet Blenheim apricot and currants garnishing the deep-fried dough cubes.  A potent excellent irish coffee (purveyor=Equator?) pairs wonderfully with dessert.

Nopa&apos;s entire business is a perfectly tuned instrument.  Service is warm and up-beat at the always buzzing bar.  The restaurant is inviting, comfy, and never *not* crowded.  From the bar to dining booths, this place is poppin&apos; and hoppin&apos;-- for good reason:  food is expertly executed, atmosphere is lively if loud, and staff are supremely welcoming and professional.  Main challenge? Its popularity. Very difficult to get reservations.  When it does re-open to the public and you do manage to get in, you&apos;ll be in for a superb meal."
5,"I am really glad Nopa operates during the pandemic. I had a perfect lunch with my boyfriend there. And I feel like it will be one of our favorite places. They have plenty of choices, and food is so good, especially when you are picky like me. Among my favorites are warm goat cheese plate (delicious !!), smoked trout, and the best avocado toast I&apos;ve tried. 
Trout was done very good, oiled, and tender. I am very picky with fish, but Nopa knows how to make it right, and healthy.
We both left very satisfied with the quality of food, not to mention that service was excellent!"
4,"remember just stumbling upon this for brunch awhile back
we were on the waitlist for a short time and got seated fairly quickly for weekend brunch 
parking in the area is relatively hard to find
we ended up ordering the french toast and the burger which were good
relatively speaking
it was pretty loud in there and we couldn&apos;t really hear each other talk and made the meal less enjoyable
restrooms clean 
great customer service friendly staff"
5,"This place is spectacular!  Every single thing about this restaurant is amazing! The service, food, atmosphere and even patrons make this place THE place to be.

Hands down the best place I&apos;ve ever eaten!  Every waiter is attentive, friendly and clearly trained well to ensure your experience is wonderful.

The food is very fresh and obviously prepared with love and passion.  If I could give this place 100 stars I would.

Do yourself a favour and go hungry, order everything &amp; enjoy.  Worth the flight to SFO on its own!

I can&apos;t wait to go back!"
4,"I&apos;ve never been to Nopa because it&apos;s always so hard to get a reservation or there&apos;s always a line. When I found out they&apos;re doing takeout, I was really psyched to try it. 

I got the fried chicken for hot food, and pork chop and pasta to make at home. The fried chickens were very crispy and well seasoned! Better than what I had at a lot of places that specialize in fried chicken. The instructions are pretty easy to follow for the kits, and the pork chop turned out to be very delicious! 

They have expanded the menu since the beginning of shelter in place. I&apos;m excited to go back and try something else!"
5,"Came here one Saturday night and the service and food definitely did not disappoint!

- I ordered the Seared Olive Oil Cake and my friend had the Blueberry Cobbler with Hot Sugar Crust. Although the Seared Olive Oil Cake consisted of Almond Cacao Nib Brittle, Fennel Pollen and Meyer Lemon Sherbet, I wasn&apos;t expecting it to taste that sweet. The Blueberry Cobbler is synonymous to a blueberry pie.

10/10 would do it all again. The bartender was very attentive, always checking that our glasses were filled with water and that the dessert was up to par. The decor and ambience is what probably contributes to why this restaurant is always packed. Eater SF articles don&apos;t do Nopa justice, so go IRL."
4,"This review is long overdue with my last visit last year. Dined here about 7 years ago and it was all about the pork chop! Visited for dinner with friends and that pork is still the popular dish and always my &apos;go-to&apos;. Cooked medium rare with some slight pink, juicy, smoky and flavorful with stone fruit. I&apos;d have to say one of the best in the City!

Great selection of drinks (SF pricing) and food with friendly service. I&apos;ve only been here for HH and dinner and place is lively and packed on weeknights starting at 7pm...so not the best place for a quiet or romantic dinner. Parking can be a little tricky but fortunately, parking &quot;CARma&quot; is always on my side :) 

Would love to dine here again for brunch when things settle. In the meantime, NOPA is offering TAKEOUT Tuesday - Saturday, 4-8pm taking same day order up to 1pm!  A good to know option!"
5,"My fiance and I have been wanting to try Nopa for a long time and it sure did not disappoint. The ambiance, service, cocktails and food all came together for a lovely experience. Dinner reservations are a must! 

We enjoyed our table in the loft area, where it was quieter and had a great birds-eye view of the kitchen. Our server was friendly and made great recommendations. The chicken liver mousse and vegetable tagine were delicious and the pork chop is out of this world- easily the best we&apos;ve had. Thick, juicy, tender and paired perfectly with brussels sprouts and persimmons. The goat&apos;s milk cheesecake was delicate and the perfect finishing touch."
5,"When I started planning our SF trip, I kept hearing about Nopa. I tried making reservations several weeks out and couldn&apos;t get in for a single meal across 3 days (to be fair, it was a 3-day weekend AND Valentine&apos;s weekend), so I counted it out and forgot about it. However, Sunday morning we found ourselves wandering around the Painted Ladies at 10:15 and conveniently Nopa opens at 10:30. We decided to head over and try our luck. 

When we arrived at 10:20, there were about 20 people in line. Doors opened and people literally raced for the bar seats like musical chairs! Two gals even shared a single stool! I&apos;ve never seen anything like this. We did get a seat, so we started with a pot of coffee and cocktails. Jason and Cory wete behind the bar and phenomenal! They never stopped moving and were just fantastic. We also watched as the entire staff tried every single dish of the day. That level of knowledge and service isn&apos;t at all common. I&apos;d come back for the service alone.

We decided to split 3 items, as we heard nothing is particularly large: the Fried Duck Egg, the burger, and of course custard French toast. Each was unreasonably good! The vread and goat cheese combo on the duck egg dish was out of this world, the burger was perfect, and the custard French toast lives up to the hype! 

I absolutely understand why it&apos;s difficult to get rezzies here, and feel so grateful we got in. This was truly a memorable meal and restaurant, and we will make it a point to come back next time we visit!"
4,"Vibe of the restaurant was great.

Service was excellent.

Coffee was divine. 

Food was satisfying.

I think the only part that was off was the noise of the place.  It was extremely loud so it was hard to hold a conversation.  The echo of the space is what did it.  But the place is inviting.  I liked how you can be upstairs or downstairs and get a sense that you were completely somewhere else, out of the busy city and transported to a boisterous and fun place.  It was filled with people, so you can tell there was something about it that made people want to eat here.  I recommend to make reservations in advance.  

Overall, burger was juicy and tasty.  Coffee was creamy and once you add 2 bags of brown sugar, it was perfect.  And the buttery pancakes were delicious.

I will definitely find my way back to Nopa."
5,"great burger, delicious cocktails. Love the communal table. Can&apos;t wait to be back in the din of Nopa someday!"
5,"Tip of the Iceberg! Just enjoyed a taste of NOPA on Divisadero in SF and enjoyed an incredible evening of Happy Hour appetizers that were served on large platters and charged by the piece($1) Interesting concept! There is so much more to enjoy at this amazing gathering place that locals and foodies flock to from all over, and I can&apos;t wait to experience more at this amazing restaurant! Thank you Chef Jossel for such an innovative appetizer menu and delicious well cocktails! Food is Farm to Table  and totally fresh ingredients gathered from local farmer&apos;s markets. 

Roomy communal high tables, bar seating and plentiful 2 and 4 top tables throughout this great restaurant! An incredible experience enjoying several different appetizers along with great cocktails! Ambiance is inviting, and waiters are friendly and constantly coming by to tempt you with yet another delicious creation. 

Looking forward to enjoying more of what this Chef has to offer!  Thank you! 

Parking is always a challenge.. but don&apos;t let that deter you from sampling this great food! I was pleasantly surprised! Delicious!"
5,"Went here with a few girlfriends for the first time last night. My friend had been raving about it so I was really excited to get an early res. The space is really cool and well designed, with a large downstairs and small upstairs seating arrangement. 

We started with drinks and I got the manzanita with mezcal and apple which was absolutely fantastic. Split a few apps with the warm goat cheese and calamari with chorizo, both of which were amazing, but the goat cheese was absolutely out of this world. It was so creamy and nicely paired with some sweet fruit as well. I could&apos;ve ordered 3 of these for my main meal and will be dreaming about it until the next time I go back. For the main, I got the pappardelle with the 9 hour bolognese, my my friend&apos;s got the porkchop and the veggie tangine. The pasta was so great- the noodles were massive (like lasagna noodles) and the sauce was so flavorful. I tried my friend&apos;s porkchop and was blown away at how good it was. Perfectly cooked and a flavor burst with the kumquats that came with it. Completely understand why this is recommended as one of the best chops in the city! 

We all split a great bottle of wine that our server helped to recommend, as well as the cheesecake for dessert. Both were fantastic, and we really appreciated the guidance is getting a well priced and delicious bottle. Service was also great throughout the meal. Highly recommend for a nice dinner out or date night!"
4,"Second time coming to Nopa! First time I went for dinner and had a great experience. This time my friends and I were in the area after going to some bars and wanted food at around 11pm-12am.

Nopa has a great atmosphere. Its constantly busy but never too loud and doesn&apos;t make you feel rushed to get in and get out. I also love that this place is open late!

They have great dishes. Both times I&apos;ve been here, I haven&apos;t ordered anything I didn&apos;t like. The dishes are also pretty unique and different from what you&apos;d find at other restaurants. The best part is that their food always tastes really freshly made. I would recommend the pickled herring. It was really good and went well with the garlicky bread."
5,"Not really sure why I haven&apos;t written this review yet considering my first visit to Nopa was over a decade ago. Back then I was just a tourist chasing the next good meal; I think my younger self would be amused that just a couple years later I would be living in the neighborhood and frequenting Nopa every time a payday replenished my bank account.

I&apos;ll start with the fact that it&apos;s almost impossible to get a reservation without planning far ahead. So my hot tip is to go on a weekday a bit on the earlier side (~7pm), grab a drink from one of the amazing bartenders, and then hang out until some seats open up at the bar (they serve the full menu). I&apos;d also recommend always putting your name down at the front even if the wait seems long; sometimes you&apos;re pleasantly surprised and if you&apos;ve already sat down at the bar and ordered you can just stay there. They do have a chefs counter that we&apos;ve only been lucky enough to score once since you have to do sit down service to be seated there, but doesn&apos;t hurt to ask!

Okay, well onto the food. Where do I even begin?
-I used to refuse to order avocado toast because &quot;I can just make it at home&quot;. But really...I can&apos;t make Nopa avocado toast. It&apos;s damn delicious!
-Appetizer pastas are always on rotation and I always cry that it&apos;s not an entree portion cause it&apos;s always so good.
-Porchetta. Or pork chop. If you see either on the menu, just do it.
-Smoked brisket is always a favorite.
-The burger is one of my favorites in the city.

So in these tough times during covid, they&apos;re doing take out and you can order everything online. SO GLAD!! The fried chicken is so flavorful and we LOVED the beet hummus. They&apos;re starting to add more menu items and just introduced delivery. Shout out to Holly who worked with our family to set up a special surprise meal delivery during our virtual engagement party :)) Like always Nopa never fails to disappoint. They&apos;re also doing grocery and meal boxes, so much better than being stressed out at the grocery store.

We can&apos;t wait to be one of the first customers back to dine in again once things open back up."
4,"OVERALL: Lovely restaurant in San Franciso. I would visit again. 

VENUE: Modern restaurant design with two floors and a large open bar and mixed seating (communal, booths, regular). We arrived 20-30 minutes before our reservation and were seated a bit earlier than planned.

FOOD: A wide selection of dishes inspired by flavours around the world. We had four people and ordered 2 apps and 3 mains to share. It was good food, great flavours. The pork, lamb, and cauliflower were particularly good.

SERVICE: Excellent service as expected for the price point. Nothing extra to note.

VALUE: It&apos;s definitely on the pricey end but for the great food, venue and service - it was good value for money."
3,"Came for brunch and it took some time to seat us but luckily we weren&apos;t in a hurry cause the wait was long. 

1. Butter Basted Eggs - 3
2. French Toast - 4
3. Lamb Shoulder - 4.5
4. Cabbage Dish - 3
5. Sausage - 3.5

1. The eggs were typical, but the sides of fall veggies was a nice little touch. It was a little too sweet in flavor but it was unique.
2. French toast is made well here with a very fluffy bread. It&apos;s a good go to for the table.
3. I really enjoyed the lamb shoulder. It was salty and full of flavor. We ate every last bit of it and the juices with the bread. 
4. There was a starter dish with cabbage, cheese, walnut and a sweet/savor dressing. It was good, but nothing a lot of odd mixtures of flavors.
5. I dont quite remember the dish, but i remember the sausage being good and salty, but the egg or quiche like side was left over from our table.

Overall it was an interesting experience. The interior is great, service was good, but food was alright. I would want to come back again to try to see what the rave is about though. Sounds like this place could be promising."
5,"I have been to Nopa several times pre-pandemic and it has never ceased to impress. From cocktails to appetizers to entrees, it&apos;s a great place. Today I got take out fried chicken (to go with a Loire valley cab franc I already had) along with grilled squash and buttermilk biscuits. The meal came together beautifully (and the chili honey that came with the chicken was an added pleasure). And it also paired well with the wine."
5,"Nopa is where you go if you want a top-notch dining experience in the area. This place is a star of the neighborhood with its fresh and frequently changing California cuisine, wine list and beautiful ambiance. 

Because of this, you need to make sure to make reservation in advance. Since I didn&apos;t have too much advanced, I was not able to book a reservation online but came in at opening (5pm) on a Wednesday and was able to get myself on the list for a party of 4 at 7pm. 

The restaurant has a great atmosphere with 2 levels, tall ceilings, communal tables, and private booths. We were lucky enough to be sat in a cozy booth in the center of the restaurant. The wait staff is very attentive and helped to give recommendations and made sure our beverages were never empty. We got 3 appetizers and 3 entrees to share and found that to be just over the perfect amount (though I don&apos;t mind leftovers!). Everything was fresh and delicious and as a vegetarian, I appreciated the variety of options.  

Overall, this is probably one of the nicest dining experiences in SF. I&apos;d recommend going here on a date for an upscale yet trendy dinner."
