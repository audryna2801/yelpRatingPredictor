5,"Zazie has been on top of my brunch list since I moved to SF a few years ago. I finally decided to grab brunch with a few friends on a gorgeous Saturday. Zazie doesn&apos;t have reservations so you have to put your name down on a Yelp kiosk and wait outside. Since we went right after outdoor dining was opened, Zazie was crowded (no surprise there). I had a group of 4 and we waited... 1.5 hours before we got seated. Yes, 1.5 hours for brunch. I highly recommend you put your name down EARLY if you have a large group.

Despite the long wait, everything else was perfect! We got seated in the back garden patio with heat lamps (which is a huge plus!). Service was great; food came out fast.

For starter, we ordered Victor&apos;s Home-Made Coffee Cake - portion was very generous! For entree, 3 of us ordered the Divorcée Benedict (w/ bacon, fontina, avocados) and 1 got the Fontainebleau Scramble (w/ wild mushrooms, spinach, fontina). We also got a round of mimosas - which was delicious. 

Overall, it was worth the wait. I love supporting a restaurant that gives back to our community: everything at Zazie is tax-included, that means each dish is a little bit more expensive. 25% of every menu item at Zazie is paid out directly to staff as revenue share!"
5,"Zazie has been a must visit spot for me after hearing excellent reviews and seeing it featured on Check Please Bay Area. We recently moved to a new spot Cole Valley so we knew we had to try Zazies famous brunch when they reopened outdoor dining. 

We got our opportunity this Sunday on a gorgeous day when my Mom was in town. They do not take reservations but rather, you are able to add your name to the digital Yelp waitlist in person on the day off, which was not a problem for us living nearby. You can tell Zazie is extremely popular based on the long lines. Thankfully you can walk around and do other things while waiting and they text you when your table is ready. Our wait was around an hour and 15 mins on this day. 

They have an abundance of seating with a parklets in front and a gorgeous outdoor patio. They have protective screens between each table so it feels very safe but still elegant. 

We ordered a carafe of mimosas which came with a bottle of Champagne + orange juice, so you could perfect your own ratio (which is perf because I feel like some restaurants put too much OJ). This was also a good amount to split between the 3 of us. 

For entrees, we ordered the Eggs en Fonte, Eggs Florentine, and Greece Scramble. All 3 of these dishes are vegetarian and they have a variety of other veggie options as well. 

Everything was so rich and delicious, but also well balanced with the vegetables, such as mushroom and spinach. You could tell it was cooked with a French style, with lots of butter. The home fries were perfectly soft on the inside and crisp on the outside, with full cloves of garlic mixed in. We also appreciate the server brought out condiments on request (hot sauce, mustard, pepper), that paired perfectly with our meal. We shared everything and agreed our favorite dish was the Eggs en Fonte. Everything was so filling and delicious. 

Just as a note/ extra bonus, this is a no tip expected restaurant! We left a bit of a tip just because it&apos;s hard times with Covid but I&apos;d say that&apos;s an added perk! 

We will certainly be back again for Zazie brunch, and I would like to try their dinner as well."
5,"COVID REVIEW: First time customer during the quarantine! I don&apos;t think Zazie needs another customer singing their praises, but here goes: for anyone on the fence, this place is WORTH THE HYPE! The food was fresh and delicious, and the staff was so friendly. Came on a weekday around 2pm, and it was easy to grab a table in their parklet. The three of us got a scramble, a benedict, eggs a la Marais, mimosas, and the gingerbread pancake to share. Everything hit the spot. I would say prices are pretty reasonable for SF too. Do yourself a favor and come here for a sweet brunch and a nice little walk in the neighborhood after."
4,"Pros:  friendly snd attentive service
            Dog friendly
            Location
            Good food

Cons:  street parking"
4,"My friends and I initially came here because we were under the impression they were open for outdoor dining, they are NOT. We decided to order anyway because we were already there. 

I got the un, deux, trois meal, which is one buttermilk pancake and two eggs and 3 strips of bacon. It was really good! The eggs were delicious and the pancake was also fluffy and sweet but not overly sweet! The bacon was good as well. My friends got eggs benedict that they enjoyed as well! Overall it was a really nice meal!"
5,"Zazie&apos;s has fantastic food, gracious service and is a community treasure!  Indoor and outdoor seating is available, and honestly the backyard heated garden is pure magic, and has graced many a memorable occasion.  Many go for their sough-after brunch, others for special events like limoncello season, or doggy days.  We go there all the time.  We love the fish, the steak, those perfect French mashed potatoes, the pancakes, the salads ... as a family we all have our favorites and they cover the whole menu!  But it is the community you feel there that is irreplaceable.  You are seen and known ... such an uplifting experience!

Also, three of the true treasures there - the chef, the general manager and a lead server recently acquired Zazie&apos;s - so it will all be the same (with continued guidance from the owner), bu
t what an opportunity to help the workers who made it what it, to succeed!  These are really good (also hard-working), but truly fantastic people, folks!

4,"Nice outdoor seating with really aggressive bees. Weather was really nice, and most tables were shaded. Waiters were nice. Wait time over an hour at Saturday 11AM. 

Florentine w/ portobello mushrooms, wilted spinach - Able to get this with the hollandaise sauce. Juicy, shriveled, wet tomato was my favorite part. 

Eggs Any Style w/Bacon - Very good without being heavy."
5,"Oh Zazie....it&apos;s a brunch favorite in SF - what hasn&apos;t been said already? Love this place for their amazing french toast, eggs benedicts, and sun drenched patio. I don&apos;t come here often, but it&apos;s mostly that my hunger always gets the best of me, and I just can&apos;t do the long line. 
Then covid happened....and I find myself missing the whole brunch experience (or just getting out of the house in general...). But is it safe? Where do I go if I want a brunch experience where I don&apos;t feel like I&apos;m risking my life in this day and age? Zazie! 
Not only do they have their super cute back patio, they also built a parklet outside, where tables are spaced out AND they have them somewhat sectioned off from each other as well. Order with your phone via a Q code, and they take every safety precaution as well. As far as dining out goes, this is as safe as I&apos;ve felt so far. 
The food is just as amazing as I remembered, especially their eggs benedict. There are several variety that I wouldn&apos;t mind eating again and again :) Ooooh and the French Toast Tahiti is to die for! Another thing I really appreciate is their tip-free system - they pay their staff a living wage and do revenue sharing. The prices may LOOK higher, but It&apos;s such a refreshing and transparent way."
5,"Our favorite restaurant in SF!  My fiancé always gets the grilled NY steak which is delicious.  My favorite dish is the duck with their fingerling potatoes which are tossed in some type of Dijon mustard and bacon heaven.  Also love the boeuf bourguigon - a perfect comfort meal. 

They used to have an insane dessert that was essentially a giant cup of chocolate pudding/mousse with marshmallows on top that were toasted - I don&apos;t see it on the menu right now so it may be seasonal, but that&apos;s definitely worth eating when it hopefully comes back!"
5,"If you&apos;re reading these Yelp reviews, you probably already have the sense that Zazie&apos;s is heavenly. So to be quick about it, I will confirm: it&apos;s heavenly.

Now, I will tell you briefly what is especially outstanding. First, the escargot. I get this whenever I can because it&apos;s a novelty and those who serve it usually do it right. This was 100% the case at Zazie. I think these escargot were the Platonic ideal of what a snail can and should be. They were swimming in (but not soaked by) garlic butter and some green magic (basil?). I requested extra bread (which was perfect: crispy on the outside, soft and steamy on the inside) to soak up what didn&apos;t coat the snails. For my entrée I ordered the truffle and porcini ravioli, which was perfection. Each bite was a warm and ponderous blanket in which my stomach wrapped itself. Finally, dessert was the chocolate pot, which is basically what love would taste like if it were a food. I would eat all of these things again. Every day.

Since you&apos;ve hopefully decided you&apos;re going to come here, let suggest one more thing: come early and beat the crowds."

5,"What a perfect place for a special breakfast!  We were so tickled with all aspects of our perfect brunch.  The seating was perfect, the booking management was smooth, the food was amazing, and we adored our lovely server!  Maybe 5the stars were aligned for just us, but, I think this lovely place is very well managed and this is the result.  I was so pleased to receive my request of extra hollandaise sauce not only delivered, but in such a lovely fashion.  I&apos;m a gluten for the sauce and love to dip my potatoes into it as well.  Bravo!"
3,"Labor Day weekend was ridiculously hot in the East Bay!  To escape the heat on Labor Day, my boyfriend and I headed to the city to cool off and try Zazie&apos;s; it&apos;s a restaurant that neither of us had been to and I noticed many Yelpers having brunch there and not so much dinner so we wanted to give it a go.  When we drove by, we noticed there were outside booths and tables set up and parking was a bit scarce so we parked 3 blocks away (it was free parking since it was after 6PM and a holiday).

When we arrived, the staff asked us to select the table or booth we wanted to sit at out of the three that were vacant at the time.  Fortunately, we beat the dinner rush at around 6:30 PM.  Once seated, we were given our own water pitcher and a QR coded menu.  When the waitress took our order, she asked if we wanted any soup or appetizers, but didn&apos;t share the soup of the day or the daily specials.  It came to my attention when the waitress shared that information with the couple next to us.  :(  On a brighter note, the staff was mindful about keeping a safe distance from customers and would ask them to put their mask on when they came by to take their orders.

We received complimentary bread and butter on separate plates.  Our entrees were served about 10-15 minutes after our bread.  We ordered the Le Canard (duck leg) and the Saumon Liberte (wild salmon).  The dijon fingerling potatoes in the Le Canard was a bit too strong, but flavorful and the duck was a bit too dry for our taste.  We were hoping the duck would be a bit more tender and have more flavor to it.  The salmon was very soft with a slightly tougher exterior from the searing and the couscous and veggies were just delicious.  I&apos;m not usually a big couscous fan, but the herb butter really made the sides pop!

After we finished our entrees, we still had room for dessert.  We quickly ordered the decadent vanilla creme brulee.  The creme brulee didn&apos;t have enough vanilla taste, yet the added strawberries on top gave it a nice touch.  As we wrapped up our meal, the waitress brought out a card reader to handle payment and gave us the option to have an electronic receipt sent to our email.  It&apos;s great to see restaurants operating under these current COVID-19 conditions, which help to provide a place for groups of people to enjoy a bit of freedom outside of their homes.

Things to Note Before You Visit:
+ The staff use a Purell sanitizing spray on the tables
+ The staff maintain a safe distance when taking your order and dishes
+ There is only 1 restroom that can be used at one time and disinfectant spray is provided
+ Complimentary bread and butter is optional
+ Contactless payment options
+ There are about 10 tables available for outdoor seating
+ QR code menu
+ This restaurant does not take reservations, but there is a Yelp wait list
+ All of their menu prices include a living wage, revenue share, paid family leave, fully funded health &amp; dental insurance, 
​paid time off, and a 401(k) with employer match for all of their hard working employees.  Therefore, NO TIP is EXPECTED."
5,"This is quite literally my favorite restaurant. The salads are delicious and make me actually want to eat spinach. The ambiance is wonderful, we sat on the back patio and I loved the lights. Everything we ordered was fantastic and every single bite was eaten up! 
Support this fantastic place and you won&apos;t be disappointed!"
5,"Oh sweet heavens! Weekend brunch in San Francisco is always a vibe! 

I had the most delicious bday brunch here this past Sunday and everything was amazingly prepared.

When we arrived there were 22 people ahead of us, so we beat some of them up around the corner and shortened the line down by 4. 
We ordered banana walnut French toast, eggs Benedict, homefries and mango mimosas with tajin rims. 
For bday dessert the owner kindly brought out chocolate mousse, creme brûlée and a dessert Port (that I actually first tasted in Napa earlier this month).

Service, food and outside seating were all on point. 
I will be coming back sooner than later the next time my mouth waters on a Sunday morning for that banana walnut French toast. 

Other notes:
outside seating
takeout available
scan the QR code to download the menu
street parking

* oh and P.S - we didn&apos;t beat anyone up. We patiently waited the entire 50 mins until we were seated."
3,"Came here for a celebration,
hour wait, anticipation.
Vivacious host got us seated,
friendly waitress came and greeted.

Menu prices are rather steep,
but nothing in Cole Valley is cheap.
Steak tartare was a beautiful sight 
the arugula salad was just alright.

Bourride Zazie was my favorite thing
the white wine made the seafood sing.
I&apos;d maybe come back for that dish alone
But for the price, I&apos;m inclined to cook at home."
5,"A silver lining in all of this - you no longer have to wait in line forever to get brunch from Zazie! It&apos;s super easy to order online, you get a time slot to come and pick it up, so there&apos;s really no waiting around. 

They have many types of Eggs Benedict, which I love to see, but I ordered the brunch special - Eggs en Fonte. It was grilled mascarpone polenta cakes, wilted spinach, portobello mushrooms, spicy tomato-chèvre sauce,  and two over easy eggs - so delicious! It came with a side of potatoes, which have whole cloves of roasted garlic mixed in with them. 

I also had their coffee cake which was amazing! It had the best raspberry jam running through it."
5,"I lived in the neighborhood for about 9 years but have been away from SF for the last 12. Found myself in SF recently for a socially distanced cycling adventure. On the one rainy day with no cycling, I went back to Zazie for one of my favorite breakfasts. 

I always worry when I go back to an old favorite that it won&apos;t be as good and maybe I&apos;m just nostalgic. I shouldn&apos;t have worried - it was as good as I had remembered it. My most recent visit highlights:

Eggs Benedict - oh yea - they are my all time favorite Benedicts. Somehow Zazie makes the hollandaise sauce taste light! Such goodness.

Bowl sized latte - I forgot how much I missed sipping on a giant latte while trying to warm up.

PATIO - Zazie always had a great patio, but now it is a necessary with COVID. What a pleasure to be able to dine out but feel safe eating outside in a really nice space."
4,"Stopped by for brunch early morning. Has outdoor seating and take out. This place is great as it has patio seating in the front and back, choose the back cause it was quieter and away from the street.
Service was excellent, masks on, hand sanitizer, distanced from other customers, online menu via QR code, and contactless payment at the end of meal. The perfect textbook service to expect during covid times.
The food was fresh and generous portions and just delicious. Service here was welcoming and attentive and also love that there is no tipping here, the costs are added into the food. No need to tip. Would definitely go back."
5,"Fantastic brunch spot for a weekend with friends. Wait staff was very energetic and helpful
Freshly squeezed orange juice (with actual oranges not just MinuteMaid). 
The French toast was incredible - it says on the menu that it had oranges in it which I was worried would be a strange mix but I think that&apos;s just in the description to sound fancy - I didn&apos;t notice any orange flavor. 
The home fries had a good crisp skin and light seasoning. 
Just home fries and French toast was filling - didn&apos;t need any other sides. 
Gratuity is already factored into the prices on the menu which is a nice touch (helps distribute tips to BOH employees) and makes check out easy. 
Only real downside is that this place is very popular and with Covid limitations the wait is ~45m-1hr on weekends. Worth the wait every so often!"
