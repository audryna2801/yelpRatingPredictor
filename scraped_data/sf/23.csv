5,"I&apos;m so glad that Foreign cinema is back open. I&apos;d been here plenty of times pre-COVID for brunch and it had always been wonderful. Their courtyard brunch now is just as great. We made reservations about a week in advance for a Sunday brunch. 

I feel like you can&apos;t go wrong with any of their menu items from omelette to scrambled to croquet madames and more. The presentation of all the items is just as good as the taste. The staff here are kind, caring and knowledgeable and the atmosphere is great. Hope to come here soon for dinner!"
5,"Truly impressed with this place! From the service to the ambiance to the food - everything was excellent. Though I would typically prefer to try new dining experiences as opposed to repeating the same ones, I would put this place squarely on my repeat list. 

They did a really good job with COVID precautions. The courtyard seating area was lovely with all the string lights, movie projection, and beautiful mural art. The heat lamps were perfect for countering the chilly evening. 

The Brandade Provençale and Liver Mousse appetizers were good, but I think they nailed our entrées and desserts even more. The Wagyu steak was delicious - very soft with a nice char on the outside. The accompanying potatoes, broccoli rabe, charred onions, and sauce all went really well together. The bite of Swordfish I tried was also excellent - very moist, flakey, and well-flavored. 

Both the Chèvre (goat cheese) Cheesecake and Gateau au Chocolat (chocolate ganache cake) were also memorable - very light, silky, and well balanced. The chocolate tasted like Valrhona and was not too sweet, which is exactly how I like it. It&apos;s not every day you can find a place that nails service, ambiance, entrées, desserts, and drinks. Definitely looking forward to being back!"
5,"Almost a year later and I&apos;m still drooling over the brunch I had last year when outdoor dining re-opened.  Reservations were easy to make and I didn&apos;t have to make it months in advance.  I like that they have their own private patio and that we can still enjoy the great atmosphere.  

The duck leg confit was absolutely perfect!!  Perfect I tell you.  This is my favorite brunch meal ever.  The duck was seasoned well and it was so crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  The eggs were poached perfectly with that runny yolk inside.  The fruit added a nice sweetness and the croutons added crunch.  I like how they alter their menu to use what&apos;s in season.  The fruit and salad was fresh and vibrant so I knew it hasn&apos;t been sitting around for days.  The Persian omelette was soft and fluffy, and full of flavor.

I don&apos;t even know why it took me so long to try this place but I&apos;m glad I did.  Now I need to come back to try their dinner menu."
5,"remember my wife bringing me here to celebrate my birthday
she kept it a secret from me and just gave me a nearby address haha
parking was ok in the area, not too horrific
the atmosphere inside is amazing and romantic
i totally didn&apos;t expect it from the looks of the neighborhood
we had the oysters, duck, and pasta and all were amazing
the sorbet, affogato and complimentary cake were an amazing way to end the evening
would definitely come again"
5,"Our dinner at Foreign Cinema was marvelous from start to finish. And our senses were dazzled well before our first item of the meal arrived. The outdoor space was super-cute, spacious and airy with nice tables. It was a little cool when we sat down in the early evening but the level of heat from the heating lamps was right in the Goldilocks zone (not too hot, not too cold). The next thing we perceived was the sounds of a live guitar emanating from a musician inside the restaurant, a lively but soothing strumming that was sufficiently audible to be heard but not too loud (again, Goldilocks).
 
As the sun went down, the outdoor lighting came on, a golden glow that cast a warm, soft light on everything. And once it became sufficiently dark, the night&apos;s movie came on. It was Austin Powers. Which was awesome.
 
Our service was phenomenal! Everyone we encountered was lovely, but our waitress (Melanie) was especially outstanding. Prompt, professional, courteous, for sure, but what we especially appreciated was that she gave us her honest opinion when we asked her questions about the menu (and she was correct). A perfect example of this is when we asked if a certain wine (a grenache/mourvedre blend) would go well with what we ordered. She hesitated, commented on its unique characteristics, and brought us a sample to see if we liked it. It was good (and I would have had a glass or two on its own), but not what we wanted with our dinner, and when we asked her what she recommended, she suggested the syrah (a less expensive wine). It paired perfectly.
 
As for the food, we split the brussels sprouts, which was more of a salad than I would have consented to ordering. However, it had some lovely sweet and tart citrusy notes that complemented the bitterness of the greens, which was so good that even I had a large helping for myself (victory for my gf). For our entrées I had the duck breast and my gf had the truffle pasta with added truffle service (which Melanie recommended). The duck was the Platonic ideal of what roast duck should be: tender, juicy, not overly gamey. The &quot;fixins&quot; made it all the more wonderful. Specifically, what I thought were crustini was actually crisped pâté (the best pâté I ever had), the crunch and flavor of which upped the dish substantially. The cherries added an additional sweetness and tartness that further balanced the duck. The pasta was divine, smooth and truffley (again, the Platonic ideal of what truffle pasta should be).
 
For our dessert we shared cheesecake and the chocolate birthday cake. Both were delicious, but the cheesecake was slightly better (sweet, creamy-dreamy goodness). I don&apos;t know what more to say about it. My threshold for dessert enjoyment is only so sensitive, and both of these delights overwhelmed it."
5,"We came to foreign cinema today for brunch and I&apos;d always wanted to check this place out but felt like I needed to have an ~occasion~ to go since it is a little pricey. But my friend recommended that our occasion be that we should just love ourselves and to be honest she was right (we did survive 2020). We made reservations a week out after trying to walk in on a different weekend day and found ourselves faced with a long wait time. The outdoor area they had is so cute and all of the employees were extremely friendly. 

We ended up sharing the French toast, the champagne truffle omelette, their slow cooked brown butter bacon, and each got a drink. I got the Bloody Mary (that apparently won awards and my friend who usually doesn&apos;t like BMs enjoyed my drink too) and my friend got the Heaven&apos;s Gate (which to me tasted like a stronger mimosa). Both drinks were really good! 

In terms of the food, the French toast was moist and all of the toppings were great additions. The omelette was really soft and had distinct truffle flavor and was accompanied with these potatoes that honestly were my favorite part of the dish. BUT the star of the show was the bacon!! We got the bacon on the side on a whim (bc like I said, this was an occasion to love on ourselves) and it was such a great decision. The bacon pieces were thick, caramelized, and a perfect balance of sweet and savory. I probably could&apos;ve eaten the entire plate myself.

We were two small girls but finished all the food including our drinks because everything was that good! Will definitely be coming back!"
5,"Best dining experience usually, but especially during Covid. The one restaurant in SF where the experience hasn&apos;t changed. They have the cutest / coziest outdoor courtyard. 

The fried chicken was absolutely unreal. Most unique flavors, I would go back again tonight just for this. 

It&apos;s a must go in SF!"
5,"The Crown Jewel of San Francisco deserves its lofty spot as a house that coveys  a wealth of warmth and welcoming. 
From the front of the house being greeted and sat seamlessly.  Thanks Dash and Scott.
We were sat comfortably at a table where we felt a safe distance dining .  (Our first time in a year) 
We ordered family style and the brandade and poke a definite stand out with our first courses.  Who knew salted cod could be such a delight!
The truffled omelette was silky deliciousness incarnate.  Wow!
Our server Hunter kept our wine chilled and his attentiveness to our table felt seamless.
We ordered a  multitude of dishes and one after the other all were supremely satisfying and over the top flavor combo&apos;s that would satisfy any pallet.
I gush but I left so content.  Treating my family to such a memorable meal  has made my day.  Yay!
Thank you Foreign Cinema"
5,"What a great experience - come for the atmosphere, great service, and well thought out dishes - leave saying &quot;while it was a tad pricey - so worth it&quot;. The chicken was hands down the best I have had in a long time! Classy place with so much charm. Nothing else like it in San Fran."
5,"Been trying to visit the place and it was worth the trip! We had our family pre-Thanksgiving date with the kids and it was such a lovely experience. Our server&apos;s very kind. We love him! Everyone in the resto was truly nice.
Everything we ordered and tried was GREAT, from the appetizers to the dessert. 
There is a nearby for pay parking, a block or so away. 
Their restroom even offers free tampons (excuse me)! It is worth mentioning for it shows the kind of attention to customer service the place has.
Place is lovely; food is great; people are genuinely nice!"
5,"Honestly, this place was amazing! It&apos;s been on my yelp bookmark for over 2 years and I FINALLY was able to make a same - day reservation on a random Thursday evening during quarantine times. They weren&apos;t so busy when we were seated ~6pm but by 7 all the tables were filled. 

The ambiance was perfect! Perfect for a date night with romantic dim lighting with a classic movie playing in the background. My friend who was visiting from France was also very impressed with the menu and the wine selection. Everything we had was so good. I had the steak and by chefs recommendation for it medium, which was perfect. We tried their cheaper Sangiovese and didn&apos;t care for it and they were happy to switch it out. 

The service was great, the food was delicious, the atmosphere was beautiful- what more can one ask for."
5,"I have to give this place 5 stars for the ambience. Loved every bit of it. The minute you walk in, you feel like you&apos;re in wonderland. Name definitely fits the set up. Only thing is that the seats to the side have no access to the projected movie playing which kind of sucks. I went here dressed really warm and mentally prepared for outdoor dining in the cold. It was actually a lot warmer than I thought. I believe the outdoor space is enclosed by longer walls which helps provide some heat in addition to the outdoor heaters. Overall great experience. The food was good but nothing that wowed me. The staff were all kn masks and followed Covid protocol."
5,"Foreign Cinema is one of the best restaurant the City of San Francisco offers.  This restaurant is the iconic of the San Francisco cuisine where the menu is put together using mostly local ingredients.  Although the wine list is not a mile long, they offer some of the best domestic and imported wines ever.  I particularly like the sea foods served here the most.  You can tell it just arrived at the restaurant before being cooked and served.  That&apos;s how fresh it is.

The vibe and the ambiance of Foreign Cinema is another long story.  Too long to be put in a Yelp review.  Briefly, you have to be there to feel the awesomeness of it."
5,"As someone who grew up in San Francisco, it&apos;s a travesty that this was my first time going to Foreign Cinema. At least, we went for a special event - my wedding reception. During COVID, it was extremely difficult to find a place for my small group. We are so lucky we reached out to Foreign Cinema. They took amazing care of us - from the event planner Janine to the staff onsite (shoutout to James and Miguel). They followed all safety protocols, including requiring masks when we weren&apos;t seated to eat. We were given the whole Mezzanine area, which provided plenty of space and openness. 

We chose the four-course menu and added oysters. The amuse bouche was one of the highlights - ricotta cheese topped with roe and saffron and drizzled with honey. I&apos;m still dreaming about that appetizer. The oysters were extremely fresh and everyone was delighted with their entrees. The staff went above and beyond with the dessert. I ordered the pot de creme, and they provided two so that I could put my wedding cake topper on them. 

The atmosphere was intimate and cozy. Honestly, despite all of the challenges of being a #covidbride, my wedding day turned out perfectly and much of it was due to Foreign Cinema. Thank you!"
4,"Have always been a big fan of Foreign Cinema, so I was very excited to visit again when they started offering outdoor dining! Came on a Thursday evening for a date night with a reservation. 

Environment: Was disappointed that they were not playing any movies in the patio area :( Our table was slightly far from a heater, and with the constant SF winds, we had to keep our jackets on the whole time! Tables were also closer to each other than I would&apos;ve expected but still maintained a distance from other diners. Really appreciate the paperless menu option though, was a great thoughtful touch. 

Food: Food is enjoyable as always! We ordered a sea bass dish, and a duck dish. Both dishes were amazing and cooked perfectly. The thing I love about Foreign Cinema is how everything in their dishes work so perfectly together to create harmony. They never fail to bring in something new with their changing menus :)"
5,"Went here for my first brunch experience in months this past Saturday. Absolutely as wonderful as I remember it since my last visit in January, and every time before. They&apos;re doing patio seating and taking reservations, which helped with the distancing aspect. Lots of umbrellas out to shade people from the sun as needed. Fantastic happy little patio. They even had a DJ!

Food was absolutely fantastic. Couldn&apos;t decide what to get so got a bit of everything - oysters, beef carpaccio, lavender baked goat cheese (like wut), chicken liver pate with fresh figs. Everything was so delicious. Split an entree with my friend and went for the duck confit, which came with a wonderful salad with poached eggs, fresh baked croutons and the ripest peaches. Couldn&apos;t stop so we also split the rose scented creme brulee for dessert which was super dreamy and might be the dessert of my dreams. Had a bloody mary and another cocktail with gin, some kind of lavendar, and other deliciousness. and a glass of port with dessert even though it was 1pm, but brunch makes everyone throw caution to the window. 

Service was incredible, as always. Honestly would go every single weekend if I could. Thank you for making such delicious food and a safe space during a crazy time!"
5,"This is my absolute favorite restaurant. If heaven exists, then may Foreign Cinema be the provider of all meals for eternity ... yes, it&apos;s just that good!!

They have a large outdoor space so are able to operate right now and do so with the same amazing quality that I love! 

We were seated immediately and upon leaning that it was our 20th anniversary, were greeted with some rose sparkling wine! Then we began ordering and ordering from that amazing menu!

We have always preferred to order lots of little dishes rather than one main and order we did : Beginning with caviar which was served with pappadums which is genius and they are much lighter than blinis and allow the caviar to be the star of the show. 

Oysters were up next with a crazy good mignonette! This was followed by hamachi Crudo, an amazing, delicious, corn soup with a hint of truffle - all we could do to not lick the bowl clean on that , followed by clams which were served in an amazing , herbaceous green broth with Pearl Cous Cous and Calamari in a mole sauce with chickpeas! 

We ended with a rose cream - so light and delicious!! It was simply an amazing meal from start to finish!! 

Foreign cinema is hands down my favorite restaurant anywhere! Amazing, delicious, creative food with excellent service and a fun ambiance! So glad to be back ever"
4,"It was my friend&apos;s bday so she made reservations. I&apos;ve wanted to try Foreign Cinema for a long time, and I&apos;m glad I did. Their outdoor seating was beautiful. It was a little windy, but the heat lamps definitely helped. On a cold windy night, make sure to bring a hair tie if you have long hair or else you&apos;d be eating your hair instead. They were playing a movie on the wall, but it was too noisy to hear the movie. Still, Foreign Cinema would make the cutest date spot or be perfect for an anniversary or any celebration because of the atmosphere.

For my meal, I ordered a grilled kobe bavette. It was a very delicious meal and the steak was tender yet juicy. I chose medium rare for reference. The fries were salty and tasty, and the sauce that the dish came with was great. The sauce was so good that I wish I could buy a bottle of it to bring home. I was super satisfied with my meal and pretty full that I didn&apos;t have room for dessert. My friends who got sea bass got dessert though.

No complaints on service - it was great.

I would definitely be back! Their menu changes so I&apos;m excited to try new things next time."
5,"Dinner at Foreign Cinema was delicious! We booked a 7:00 PM reservation, and were able to park right outside the restaurant on the street. Foreign Cinema has adapted to COVID well. The wait staff wears masks, and asks patrons to wear masks when wait staff is nearby or when not eating/drinking.

We started with a round of cocktails. I got one with brandy, pineapple and ginger that was light and refreshing. For our round of appetizers, we got a dozen Kumamoto Gold oysters (highly recommend! slightly sweet, really flavorful), watermelon salad (well balanced with fresh mozzarella, cacoa nibs, figs, and olive oil), and warm bread.

For our main dishes, my husband and I both got the Hawaiian Opah. It was incredible! Light, summery, great flavor with the opah and lobster. 

To finish the meal we had the Valrhona chocolate pot de creme with a peanut butter cookie. It was a nice bittersweet finish to the meal.

The patio has lots of heaters, so we stayed comfortable the whole night. I didn&apos;t take my jacket out until the last few minutes. They start playing the movie when the sun goes down, around 8:30. Between the edison lights and old movie, the ambiance was awesome."
3,"Little bit of a disappointing return visit.

Seating was out of the way in the corner, but they were busy so it&apos;s understandable, still kills much of the allure of Foreign Cinema when the screen isn&apos;t visible at all, and can&apos;t hear anything either.

Ordered the oysters, unfortunately a disappointing - not flavorful and didn&apos;t offer many topping options when served (no cocktail sauce or hot sauce)

The waygu entree was okay, but nothing exciting.

Dessert was excellent :)

 service was a bit slow (again, busy so understandable).

Will probably offer you give some other locations a try before a 3rd return visit."
