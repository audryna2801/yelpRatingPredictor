5,What a great experience during a COVID friendly outdoor business Saturday night. Made reservations - a much. On a street where you probably want to try every restaurant. This one was amazing. Cioppino for two people - a must. Great prices. All fresh food. Great service. Will come back very soon. Great memories.
5,"We came to Sotto Mare with just one thing in mind: &quot;the best damn crab cioppino.&quot; And, boy, did we find it here at North Beach.

The website didn&apos;t say anything about calling for reservations, so I was surprised when that was the first thing we were asked. I had expected we might wait 45 minutes to get a table, but I was momentarily worried we wouldn&apos;t&apos; get seated at all.

I told the waiter who greeted us we had come all the way from Idaho to eat at his restaurant. He said we might have to wait a while, but apparently someone who did have reservations didn&apos;t show up and he gave us their table rather quickly.

Because of COVID-19, the city allowed Sotto Mare and other North Beach restaurants add tables outside -- in the &quot;no parking, loading zone&quot; strip on the street. They were also given permission a day or so earlier to add tables in the alley next to them. Inside, they were only allowed to serve 25 percent of their normal tables.

The staff was very conscientious about safety. They wore masks and heavy gloves and customers were required to wear masks while they weren&apos;t eating or drinking. There were dividers to separate us from the other outdoor diners.

The waiter started giving recommendations on dishes, but Kristy stopped him and told him we had our eyes on the cioppino. And we split a bowl of crab chowder.

The chowder made me rethink my love of clam chowder. This rivaled the best of the clam chowders I&apos;ve eaten. It was rich and thick with crab. 

The cioppino, invented in San Francisco, was the best I&apos;ve ever had. West Coast dungeness crab, scallops, shrimp, clams and even salmon in a tomato broth. We shared and there was plenty for two.

No matter that on the Saturday night we ate there, former Giants outfielder Hunter Pence was a block away at Firenze by Night buying limoncello for a crowd after watching the Dodgers lose a World Series game to Tampa Bay. At Sotto Mare, the restaurant was the star."
5,"Some of the best seafood we&apos;ve had in a really long time. We were in San Francisco for the day as we were going to Napa the following day our wedding and with many places closed we were looking for some spots opened as we know San Francisco has great eats. Many of the locals recommended Soto Marre, I turned to my trusty Yelp App and sure enough the reviews or worth a visit. 

We decided to go with some of the best from the East and West, oysters of course. Extremely reasonably priced at under $2 and $3 bucks they were well with it, plus it&apos;s part of the name of this joint!  Sensational ! Fresh, juicy, moist, tasty, add some hot sauce and your good to go! 

I decided to go with a seafood linguine with clams, scallops, shrimp and more. Again, out of the park, creamy texture with the white sauce yet not overly heavy, cheesy but not overpowering. Everything was well balanced, the seafood was exceptional, exactly what I wanted. 

The wifey wanted some pasta as well but with more claims, mussels and the best of what the bay had to offer,  so she went with a red pasta plate with just about all you can imagine. Mussels, claims, scallops, prawns the works. Man the flavor was unreal. 

The waiter was extreme kind and was very hospitable, she did a great job. Everyone was properly spaced due to the cities Covid restrictions. Great food, Great Service, would highly recommend !"
5,"After spending weeks at home I was itching to go out and eat. I was craving cioppino and SO and I headed out to North Beach. Originally I wanted to make reservations but I took a chance and got there super early for dinner. It was not that crowded which was nice. The restaurant across the street had live music so it was nice to hear people enjoying themselves again.

We were promptly seated and ordered:

Crab Cakes: These were large sized crab cakes and came with a small side of arugula and radicchio salad. It had large chunks of crab and was really good.

Cioppino: Large bowl with dungeness crab, fish, mussels, clams, shrimp, calamari and a slice of grilled sourdough bread. SO and I were supposed to share but he inhaled the rest of it after I only took one crab leg! That&apos;s how good it was. 

Seafood Spaghetti with red sauce: The spaghetti was perfectly cooked al dente and came with fish, mussels, clams and calamari. I really enjoyed this as well.

Service was friendly and attentive, our server was great at checking in with us periodically.

After we finished our meal Green street was bustling and it was nice to finally  be around people again albeit socially distanced."
4,"Great service on a busy Saturday night. I ordered 6 Oysters, Cup of Clam Chowder The Sand Dabs and a Quart of Clam Chowder to go.
If during this pandemic you are a little nervous about being around crowds Stay Home or just order to go. I&apos;ve just been wanting to get out of the house the past few weeks.
Everyone on staff is masked up, they are disinfecting the tables after turnover
Some people are waking by stopping without a mask on and just observing.
The whole vibe on Green St. On Saturday night is awesome,  night and day compared to last Sunday night.
Outside dining is 100% a good time in this part of North Beach. There were DJ&apos;s a playing and even a live blues band on this street.
Only 4 stars because the Oysters are small and the Yelp menu does not reflect their current prices.
Most restaurants have to up there prices to keep open.
If you want to go to a spot where the staff is doing everything in their power to keep you safe then Sotto Marie Oysteria is a great option the Clam Chowder was awesome, the Sand Dabs with vegetables cooked perfectly,  just wished the Oysters were bigger.
And the service was outstanding. 
I showed up, they put my name down asked my cell phone number and told me &quot;It would be an hour&quot; they ended up calling about 50 minutes later, I never heard the phone ring because of all the fun and music on  Green St. I Noticed 15 minutes after they called so I went over to them, Now they could have very well said , tough shit , we called you. Instead they looked and said it will be about 15 minutes. My dining experience was awesome, the vibe on Saturday night is what everyone should experience it was that much fun. Will definitely go back another time."
3,"Let&apos;s crack it down: 
- Clam shooter (ran out of oyster for the day) 
- Scallop sauté combo 
- Fettuccine with bay scallops pasta 
- Complimentary bread

Per covid, it&apos;s QR code menus. Staffs were all following safety protocols, very friendly. Finally, get to outdoor dine again on our little Italy strips. I&apos;d say the foods were ok. The scallop combo would be my favorite, who doesn&apos;t love big scallops? Pasta wise, nothing too crazy. I wanted to try the crab cioppino but didn&apos;t want to get my hands dirty in public especially cause of covid so maybe next time. There&apos;s so many pastas and seafood restaurants around this area, can&apos;t wait to try them all!"
5,"I really enjoyed their Linguine with Seafood. Their goal is to provide fresh seafood with the most authentic Italian way of cooking, and I think they did an amazing job. It kind of remind me of the seafood linguine I had in Italy. I recommend it with the white cream sauce and to eat it fresh if you can, especially since outdoor dining is open again. I also had their West Coast oyster and clam on half shell as an appetizer, it&apos;s not bad, comes on shaved ice.

I had also ordered a pint of their Boston Clam Chowder to take home, which has bits of bacons in it, to go with their sourdough bread. Yum, it&apos;s nice when the potato pieces are small.  The service was great. I also like that the restaurant was open by locals. I would definitely come back."
4,"The food was amazing along with the staff! We made a reservation for 6:30pm and they saved us a nice booth/closed-off section and were sat soon after arriving. There was miscommunication with the servers and we weren&apos;t check on after being seated until we had to get up and get someone to take our order. Other than that, the wine and seafood was amazing! A plus was the warm bread straight out of the oven!"
5,Came here for lunch and it was amazing! Everyone&apos;s food was so good. We ordered the choppino and the bay scallops and prawns. The choppino was so amazing and tasty. Those bay scallops so good. The inside of the restaurant smelled so amazing. All the staff was so friendly. Excellent service
5,"If any place is deserving of 5 stars, Sotto Mare is it!  SO amazing!!  My friend had mentioned how good the cioppino is, but I wasn&apos;t so sure at first.  We arrived and ordered the fettucini with bay scallops and the cioppino.  The fettuccini flavor and sauce was soooo good.  The scallops were a little overcooked, but I still enjoyed the dish overall. 

The real star of the night was the cioppino.  I did not realize how good it would be, nor how large the portion was.  Definitely meant for sharing.  Make sure you have a fairly empty stomach if you&apos;re going to try to finish it!  And save room for bread- you&apos;ll need it because the sauce is so delicious that you&apos;ll want to dip your bread in and soak it all up.  The owner actually came by and brought more bread when she heard we had ordered the cioppino and I initially had said no to more bread.  I am so glad she was looking out, because it was definitely needed!  The cioppino comes with tons of seafood, tons of pasta, and tons of deliciousness.  Between my friend and I, we were just barely close to finishing.  Everyone who walked by was staring at the dish, and for good reason- it was as delicious as it was impressive looking.

I would 100% come back to Sotto Mare, and I 100% recommend giving it a try!  I had to wait a while to be seated, but there were plenty of places to visit in the area.  And the cioppino was worth the wait!!"
5,"We came at the end of a Napa trip, and this was a trip highlight. Enjoyed every single moment here. It was freezing cold outside and we still enjoyed the porch because the seafood cioppino was piping hot, and the best we&apos;ve ever had. Reputation is spot on."
4,"The sautéed scallops where the best plate of the dinner, the sauce was amazing and the portion just right!
The Cioppino deserves the title of The damn best Cioppino! The size is perfect for sharing but it was unclear why there was a whole layer of penne pasta at the bottom of the bowl. 
Unfortunately the risotto with mixed seafood was a disappointment, it tasted more bitter than anything else. As an italian I&apos;d give the risotto a 5/10 because it was not worth the 24$ it costs."
5,"The thousands of 5 star reviews says it all. This place is one for the books. I&apos;ve been wanting to try this place since moving into the city and finally had the opportunity now that outdoor dining is an option again. We arrived around 7:30 pm on a Wednesday and were seated within 5 minutes. We started with a dozen of the west coast oysters. WOW. They were buttery and delicious. I could have eaten another dozen myself but we had a lot more goodies in store. We shared the lobster ravioli which was a hefty portion and perfect as a shared entree. Fluffy pillows stuffed with an ample amount of lobster meat. By far the best lobster ravioli I&apos;ve ever had. We also shared the best crab cioppino I&apos;ve ever tasted. Loaded with muscles, clams, crab legs, calamari, and scallops.... just divine. The broth isn&apos;t too heavy or too watery. It was perfection in a bowl. Whatever you choose on the menu, you won&apos;t be disappointed. The service is pretty phenomenal too. Friendly and efficient."
5,"This is really simple.  If you are in San Francisco and like Cioppino, and you don&apos;t go to Sotto Mare, you are missing the single best meal you could have in the city.  I&apos;ve been here a few times and every meal is memorable.  

This place ain&apos;t fancy.  It&apos;s more like a place you go after a night of drinking. But, the food is more like what you&apos;d get at a Michelin star restaurant.  So, don&apos;t dress up, wear an old T-Shirt and jeans and get ready to eat.  Also, they don&apos;t take reservations so be prepared to wait (unless you are alone and can fill a spot at the counter).

I started with a half dozen west coast oysters.  They were perfectly shucked (meaning no shell but plenty of liquor), were super fresh, and tasted like the ocean.  Paired with an ice cold Stella, they were the perfect starter.

The fun really begins after the oysters.  Don&apos;t bother reading the menu.  Just order &quot;The Best Damn Crap Cioppino&quot; and no, it&apos;s not enough for two. In fact, I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;d keep eating until I ended up in a coma.  Once you&apos;ve devoured all of the seafood, you&apos;re gonna finish the bread by dipping it in the broth.  Then, your gonna get a spoon and finish the broth.  Then, you&apos;re gonna chip your teeth while eating the bowl.  

I&apos;m sure the other food on the menu is great but if it&apos;s your first time, follow my suggestions.  I can almost guarantee you&apos;ll walk out fat and happy."
4,"I&apos;m so glad we were able to dine at this restaurant during COVID. They were still quite busy but my bf &amp; I came at the right time before the rush. The day we came was the first day they started to open up for indoor dine in. They also had seating outside if you&apos;re not comfortable with dining in. 

We ordered their famous cioppino, sea scallops, clams and 3 of each of their oysters. The oysters tasted fresh and delicious. We did enjoy the east coast version better. It is also bigger. Sea scallops were also really good and soft. Super tasteful and would def order it again. 

We were super excited for the cioppino. Lots of seafood inside but I thought it was just ok. The cioppino at Phils in Moss Landing was def better. It didn&apos;t have as much flavor. It was still good, but not great. 

Overall We would come back and try their clam chowder and risotto. Service was really good as well. The waitress was nice and attentive."
5,"Went over the weekend with my friends and their setup to accommodate for outdoor seating is sooo well done and cute!! I LOVE the private wooden booths with the cute lighting. The food and ambiance was excellent with great service.  Our group of four made reservations the day of on a Saturday night with ease. I&apos;d definitely go back next time I&apos;m in town. 

For food we ordered the following::

-two dozen oysters, half east coast &amp; half west coast. Both were sooo good with SUCH great prices! (West 1.50, east 2.50) :: 5/5 highly recommended 

-The Best Damn Crab Cioppino: 5/5 great seafood fish with great portion sizing. Also the crab in it was precracked and perfectly cooked!

-Wedge salad: 4/5 basic salad but I really enjoyed it, lots of bleu cheese which I loved

- Linguine with manila clams: 3/5. Good but not my favorite item. It had a unique after taste that I didn&apos;t hate but wasn&apos;t my favorite. My other friends loved it though! 

-Lobster Ravioli: 5/5!!!! It was their special of the night and SOO good!! My favorite dish of the night!

-Seafood risotto: 5/5 perfectly cooked and delicious!"
1,"This was only the second-worst meal I have experienced in 35 years of living and dining in San Francisco.  But it was even more inexcusable than the worst-ever dinner, which occurred at a place where a guy attempted to prepare Italian cuisine in a wok.  

Sitting in the raucous heart of North Beach, Sotto Mare bills itself as a righteous Italian oysteria and Italian seafood restaurant.  It failed on every account. Let me count the ways: 

The utterly tasteless oysters were accompanied by the same red cocktail sauce you get in a party-sized package of pre-cooked Safeway shrimp.  Awful. 

The baccala, which is supposed to be a salty, cod-dy dip that sings of the sea, turned out to be another red-glop concoction that tasted less like fish and more like the aforementioned Safeway cocktail sauce. It was garnished with a single pathetic parsley leaf. Pointless. 

The bland seafood risotto had the consistency of a porridge that had been abandoned for several days on somebody&apos;s  back burner.  While the porridge - er, risotto - contained an array of seafood, the bits failed to the counter the blandness, sogginess  and over-all inept preparation of the dish. Shocking. 

The worst of the worst was the shrimp diavola, which which arrived on pasta overcooked to the point that it was even mushier than the risotto/porridge. The dish was overwhelmed, if not to say destroyed, by mass quantities of undercooked garlic.  Now, don&apos;t get me wrong. I love garlic and normally boost the the recommended ration by 2x to 3x in most recipes I prepare at home. But the garlic onslaught in this instance represented no less than overt culinary malpractice.  Fun fact 1:  In spite of the garlic blitz, the dish otherwise was so tasteless that we had to hunt down salt to jazz it up.  Fun fact 2: This is the first time in my 72 years on the planet that I did not finish all the pasta on my plate.  It was THAT bad.  Disgusting. 

To be charitable,  I am giving them one star for surviving Covid in hopes they will be able to up their game after the lockdown ends.  If they do, however, I will never know. Becuase there&apos;s no way I would go back."
5,"We celebrated our Valentine&apos;s Day to this place for I really wanna experience the best Cioppino in the City &amp; dining at the same time instead of take-out. I called the Resto that day hoping to make Reservation but they only do it for 3-6 ppl.   So I was willing to wait. She said about 1 1/2 hr. Wait but by the time we got there &amp; checked-in it was 3:30 &amp; she said it was 2 hrs. wait instead. Time flies for the was a huge park with this beautiful Historical Saints Peter &amp; Paul Chirch. We seated after 2 hours but it took another hour for the main course to come-in. So we got the sourdough bread to start that comes w: the meal. We got the Crab Cioppino, Scallops &amp; Prawn Linguini. My expectations were met. It taste so fresh that none smell fishy. Sooo tasty &amp; creamy. All I can say the wait is worthy &amp; definitely I&apos;ll be back to try other dish. The Staff like the Host &amp; our Waitress were excellent inspire how busy the place. By 6;30pm they stopped the walk-in.s  They were fully booked. It made our celebration memorable."
3,"I&apos;m so glad it finally opens up for dine in outdoor and indoor. They do that precautions and set up barriers between each table. The host was very accommodating even when half of our party came late. The food wasn&apos;t anything impressive or superb. We got the risotto which was probably the star of the dinner. We also got oysters, fettuccine with bay scallops (this was bland), Boston clam chowder, and &quot;the best damn crab Cioppino&quot;. The best damn Ciopinno deserves a 3 starts. We were most excited for this dish but it was just okay. I would come back for the clam chowder and the risotto...but nothing else.
The Cioppino was big enough to share between 3 people!"
5,"I hate to say this as the customer but I think that what you get for their cioppino is more than what it costs!
I was blown away by getting an actual tub of goodies when my order got delivered! I think it&apos;s only here in SF where seafood is aplenty that you can get an experience like this.

So, this popular restaurant doesnt more people saying this, but come here for quintessential SF seafood dishes."
