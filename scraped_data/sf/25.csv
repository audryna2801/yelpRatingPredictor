5,"I&apos;m a big fan of deep dish pizza, so I was excited to give Little Star a try! We ordered the &apos;Little Star&apos; pizza, which contained spinach, mushroom, ricotta, feta, and garlic. I was a bit skeptical of the combination at first, but the combination of multiple cheeses, spinach, and mushroom on top of a flaky crust turned out to be a delicious and almost lasagna-like pizza. This was also my favorite pizza crust I&apos;ve tried.

For Covid-19, Little Star seems to be doing a great job of social distancing, maintaining cleanliness. I appreciated that they put a seal on the pizza box before handing it off for extra security. I worried that take-out would be underwhelming due to the different experience of eating it at home. However, this pizza was a treat, and I can&apos;t wait to go back!"
5,"Great deep dish pizza but the cornmeal crust is not for everyone -- we love it but some may find it too gritty. The spinach signature TDF. They are so popular that staff can be a bit ambivalent-curt-jaded-overwhelmed-pissy on a busy night but if you order take-out, that&apos;s immaterial.  The Divisadero location is more civil-calm than the one on Mission, but for some reason (maybe its in our heads), the latter location&apos;s pies are a teeny bit tastier."
5,Best thin crust vegetable pizza  in town. Period! Never had better. Love their takeout. Just wish it came faster :)
4,"I haven&apos;t had a bunch of deep dish pizzas--actually, Little Star popped my deep dish cherry!  So I don&apos;t have anything else, really, to compare the experience to.

I prefer a thin-crust pizza to deep dish, but sometimes I&apos;m just in the mood for something only deep dish can bring.

It&apos;s generally a pretty good bang for your buck.  The typical wood-fired pizza is about $23 through Doordash, and lasts me about 1.5 meals.  A small deep dish from Little Star is about $28 through Doordash, and lasts me about 3 meals.  I mean, they&apos;re different experiences so you can&apos;t really choose one over the other for price reasons.  But it&apos;s a thought.

One thing that will require some trial and error is reheating.  Thin-crust pizza is pretty easy: just heat over a stovetop with a lid and it&apos;s as good as fresh.  It took me a bit of time to figure it out with deep dish because it&apos;s thicker, and the way things are layered makes it a little odd.  I recommend stovetop heating first to warm up the crust and cheese at the bottom, and then popping it into a toaster oven to get the outer crust and sauce on top nice, crispy and warm."
4,"Their large deep dish was delicious! Their cheese was so stringy. Their crust was really corn bread like, so good: crunchy yet fluffy! I would definitely order this again.

Also had their large thin crust pesto chicken pizzza. The pesto didnt taste as a fresh as I remember so I think next time, I&apos;ll ask first how their pesto is that day. Since I love the pesto so much, I might order a pesto only pizza next time!"
3,"We&apos;ve been so enamored with Zachary&apos;s stuffed pizza that we thought we&apos;d try a deep dish here.
We paid for extra ingredients on the classic but checked with each other during the meal - &quot;doesn&apos;t seem like they added very much of what we paid extra for&quot;.   Like next to none.
I&apos;d give it a C grade.
We&apos;ll stick to thin crust next time.  That way they can&apos;t hide it.
Try harder guys.  We did.  
Don&apos;t be so effing cheap."
4,"Got their large deep dish (12&quot;) -  half Pollo, half Little Star (paid extra to do half &amp; half) for $33.
Pizza was nice and heavy, and we had a hard time deciding which one we liked more. The tomato sauce and spinach (on both) was really fresh and delicious. Couldn&apos;t taste any brie in the Pollo, which was really unfortunate since that was what got us really excited about it. We were also pleasantly surprised by how &quot;potent&quot; the smokey bacon really was, as it came through more than anything else."
4,"Got 4 deep dish pizzas (3 small, 1 large) for take out. $106 with change. Not cheap! At least the flavors did not disappoint. Second day leftovers were as delicious, which is important. 

BBQ chicken has a LOT of BBQ sauce. Very juicy, with sweet accents. 

Little Star is their specialty. Enjoyed the combination of spinach, mushrooms, ricotta, and mozzarella and tons of tomato sauce. Interesting combination of flavors for a deep dish pizza. Even our vegan friend relented and enjoyed this pizza till the last crumb!

Meateor 2.0 is perfect for all the meat lovers. Appreciated that it also had mushrooms, as they go well with sausage and tons of tomatoes. Very flavorful. 

The crust is crunchy. I like crunchy crust, so I enjoyed it. My friend said there was too much crust. To each their own. I&apos;d get this pizza again and again, if I lived in SF. Probably best deep dish pizza outside of Chicago."
4,"I was craving some deep dish pizza and I am glad to have found this place thanks to Yelp! They are only open for takeout and delivery, so I ordered via a delivery service app. I got a 9&quot; Classic Pizza and asked for half of it to be BBQ Chicken. Both had great flavor and were tasty even after reheating. However, bacon pieces were tough and I wish there were more pineapple bits. Pizzas are overpriced for the portion size, but worth a try."
5,"At Little Star the star is the sauce.  Let&apos;s just lavish this little pizzeria&apos;s red sauce with the pulitzer shall we? The puree is studded with angular chunks of tomato, whose derivation may or may not be a can, but in any case add herbaceous notes to the harmonious whole, of which can be said to be sweet, somewhat spicy and acidic; rich. No wonder it sits atop the deep dish pie to be admired by all. By meal&apos;s end you will no doubt feel full and yet also buoyed by the semolina lightness of it all. There are leftovers for day two, and that, you can look forward to."
4,"UPDATE 3/7/21: Wow, owner replied to my post very quickly and with care. it&apos;s clear that this place takes quality seriously. I&apos;m gonna chalk up my salty experience to a temporary fluke and trust the glowing reviews again when we return. Thanks, Little Star!"
5,"One of my favorite deep dish pizza spot in San Francisco! Brings back memories of the deep dish pizza I had in Chicago!

Love how it&apos;s the dough rarely ever get burnt and it&apos;s always so loaded with cheese, meat and toppings! Perfect for a cheese pull shot !!

If you never had deep dish pizza before, you definitely need to try!!"
3,"Ordered spicy baked wings and Italian combo, thin crust.
The star of the show is definitively the thin crust. Great flavor, enough toppings, enough sauce. I would order this again.
The wings were just okay. Nothing out of the ordinary, I would say a bit spicy for my liking and for the price I believe the small is still a very small order of wings.
I would order again but probably just stick with a pizza. I haven&apos;t had a deep dish in a while here, although I do recall them being quite big and hearty."
5,"Omg just had the best pizza did a spinach and mushroom thin crust.  Perfection 
The crust was delicious and the crew so warm and friendly"
5,"Making it a mission of mine to branch out and try more pizza spots in the city and I&apos;m so glad it brought me to Little Star! I&apos;ve walked by it so many times, but hadn&apos;t know about it&apos;s reputation until I saw it on yelp. 

I&apos;m usually a carnivore and always get meat toppings on my pizza, but I switched it up with the Margherita Plus (thin crust) and WOW it was so good! And shout out for the great ranch dressing too! 

Now here are the logistics, order ahead and pay ahead via phone. Takes about 20 mins or so and the process is smooth and employees are friendly. It&apos;s definitely on the pricier side and I&apos;m cautious to say it&apos;s worth it for good quality pizza, but it is. I over heard someone come in just to order the artichoke bread and I definitely have to go back for it now. Little Star is definitely worth trying in my book. No regrets!"
4,"We were greeted right away upon walking in.
We went for the bar right away knowing we would get faster service.

A small but nice little place. Staff was extremely nice and helpful with all the menu items. 

We asked about their vegan options. They luckily have many. And even a full vegan pizza, dough, cheese and all! excellent!

We ordered the vegan pizza in square pan. 
And the traditional margarita pizza with pepperoni.

Now I myself is not vegan. But I had to try it to see if it actually tasted like pizza at all. And to my surprised it did. It had great flavor. Very filling. I can definitely say that if you&apos;re vegan. THIS place has an amazing vegan pizza!

Moving onto the none vegan pizza ( YAY! ) lol.
The dough was very fresh tasting. Tomato and basil was perfect.
Pepperoni was true pepperoni. Tasted like it came from Italy. No joke.

I definitely want to go back here and try more styles of their pizza.
They all look and smell amazing!
The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Is because when it starts to get extremely busy. They don&apos;t handle the line or people waiting to well. There isn&apos;t enough staff at busy times it feels like. And from what I saw.

 Decor: New and updated. No issues.

Customer service: Absolutely amazing.

Food: FAR above average.

Bathrooms: Very clean. Perfect."
5,"Really great pizza! I love how they have deep dish and thin crust options. They even have vegan cheese which is an amazing plus!

The pizza is a bit on the pricey side, but if you want to treat yourself, this Is the place. The flavors are also interesting and complex, so I recommend trying something different."
4,"I absolutely love this place. My husband and I ate here for lunch every day or every other day. The staff is amazing, we had a great conversation with them. The service is fast as always and the food served is best. They made it exactly how we like and it&apos;s always the best I&apos;ve ever had. I recommend everyone to try this restaurant!"
5,"Little Star Pizza is a cute and affordable neighborhood pizza place with great food. 

From the outsidem it looks fairly unassuming, so when we first tried Little Star we just got a deep dish to-go. However, upon entering the ambiance feels trendy with a couch, arcade game, bar seating, curtains and individual tables. At the same time it is also very warm and comforting and definitely has a neighborhood vibe with a variety of patrons from couples to families. The staff is very kind as well. 

After enjoying our deep dish at home, we vowed to go back and eat in. We especially couldn&apos;t resist when we saw they have happy hour til close Mondays and Tuesdays. We came back for this and ordered our whole meal off the happy hour menu: 
- Garlic Bread $5
- Roasted Kale $5
- Caprese $9
- Beer $5
- Wine $6

The food came out and it was larger than expected! It was the perfect amount to fill up 2 people. In particular, the garlic bread really stood out to us and was kind of like its own little pizza. The whole meal came out to around $30 before tax and tip. 

Such a good deal! Even the regular drink menu has solid prices with $2.50 beers and $7 wines. Its a gem amongst many overpriced eateries here in SF."
3,"We ordered the Spicy baked wings and the Vegetarian deep dish pizza through Doordash - the only other place in SF I know, other than Paxti&apos;s, that serves deep-dish pizza. I wasn&apos;t very impressed because the cheese wasn&apos;t adequate and the pizza base sorta felt like corn flour-based for some reason."
