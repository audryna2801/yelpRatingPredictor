5,"barely 10min wait on a wednesday at noon. the line looks long but it moves fast and the folks are super friendly. they accept credit cards and sanitize the tablet between swipes.

compared to tartine, their croissants are flakier and much more delicate. it&apos;s a matter of personal preference, but i liked these a bit more. they&apos;re so buttery that they practically melt in your mouth.

the chocolate croissant was a little too sweet for me, but the chocolate was high quality and not too dense.

the unexpected star of the show was their savory scone. i couldn&apos;t find many reviews of it, but it was probably the best scone i&apos;ve ever had. very flavorful and not dry at all."
5,"Let&apos;s take a moment to appreciate this bakery&apos;s croissants, shall we?

This was my first time visiting this bakery and I&apos;ve definitely been missing out on this iconic SF bakery! Being a passionate baker myself, I greatly appreciate a bakery that authenticates and masters the detail of the pastry they sell. ARSICAULT. DID. JUST. THAT. 

These are not your generic Costco croissants. These are nutella filled, coconut filled, ham/cheese labor of love flaky croissants! Savory or sweet, you can take your pick. What makes this croissant so special is that they are so detailed in their flakiness. This is the defining factor in a croissant. The crisp flakiness and also, how long the flakiness lasts even a day after or even days after it&apos;s baked. I noticed Arsicault&apos;s croissant was still flaky even days after. Unlike leftover croissants from Costco, Arsicault&apos;s croissants don&apos;t deflate even days after they are bought home from the bakery. They maintain their shape. This is the distinguishing factor and what makes their pastry so specially made. Just lovely! 

I decided to go all in and try a flavor of all! Even the stuffing free croissants was divine. The 20 minute outside wait was all the worth! I&apos;d go line up everyday just to eat one of these to go with my morning coffee. Everyone is following COVID protocol - the 6 feet spread apart line, masks on..the whole schpeal.

It&apos;s not morning coffee without a perfect pastry like Arsicault&apos;s perfect croissant! Hurry and go grab one before they sell out! Bon appetit!"
5,"20 minute wait on a Wednesday right before the new year, in the midst of a pandemic? It was the perfect time to try Arsicault after several years of it being difficult logistically. The plain croissant and chocolate croissant were perfect - flaky, soft, and pillowy clouds. This is probably my favorite croissant texture-wise I&apos;ve ever had. We also gave the morning bun a try but preferred Tartine&apos;s version, which is more orange zest-y and less cinnamon bun-y, if that makes sense. That&apos;s a personal preference though so I won&apos;t ding Arsicault for that.

The guy at the door taking orders was exceptionally kind and had a great sense of humor."
5,"The. Best. Croissant. Of my life!!!!!!

Got the chocolate almond and regular almond croissant because all the other ones were sold out. The crust is thick and crispy as if it were fried, which makes it unique to all the croissants I&apos;ve tried before. 

Will have to come back to get all the other ones."
5,"Ham &amp; Cheese Croissant with a black coffee. Couldn&apos;t ask for anything more. 

The flaky bites as your mouth waters moment before that cheese, ham and airy buttery bread... ouuuh. 
I can&apos;t help but wish for another bite. 

If you stumble on the line as I did. Wait in it. You won&apos;t regret it."
5,"You will not find another croissant in the Bay like Arsicault&apos;s. The layers, the flakes, the butter...it just doesn&apos;t get any better. While you may be dismayed by the line, I&apos;ll let you know that it does move fairly quickly because the operation runs smoothly and most people know exactly what they want. If you haven&apos;t had their croissants yet, I highly recommend the original and the ham and cheese. You&apos;ll thank me later."
5,"I&apos;m late to the party but wowee these pastries are the bomb! I got there at 9:15am last Saturday and waited for half an hour. Some things are worth the wait and this was one of them! 

Back in college, I used to put turkey and american cheese in costco croissants and throw them in the oven for breakfast. They were great, but Arsicault&apos;s Ham &amp; Cheese Croissants are something else. The croissant is so crisp, light, and flaky. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had!

The Kouign Amann tastes just like those heart shaped palmier cookies but in fluffy pastry form. 

The Chocolate Almond Croissant was delicious and I&apos;m already pining for more. The croissant with almond filling and chocolate was heavenly. If only I could eat these every day and not get fat hahaha. 

If you&apos;re not able to eat your pastries fresh, I highly recommend you throw them into the air fryer. Seriously these croissants left me so happy for the rest of the day :)"
5,"You know it&apos;s good when there&apos;s a line down the block. But the line goes quick . By 3 in the afternoon on a Saturday, a few items were sold out. But thankfully, the almond croissant wasn&apos;t. This was first time trying and it&apos;s everything you dream of. Crispy edges with soft and pillowey inside with the texture that makes it that good. 

The cranberry scone was savory and kinda like a biscuit texture. I wasn&apos;t too much of a fan. 

The chocolate chip cookie was aright, not as sweet as I&apos;d like. 

The service was really nice and patient. Cash and card accepted."
5,"You will never be able to eat a different croissant ever again in your life. Period. Life changing. Chocolate almond, enough said.

Oh, be prepared to wait 30+ minutes in line but that&apos;s why you buy like 6 croissant when you get to the window, okay??! WORTH IT.

Last note, there will be croissant flakes everywhere so just eat it over the sink or outdoors or whatever. :)"
5,"This place was so hyped up, there was no way it could live up to expectations right? Wrong! This place is as absolutely amazing as all the reviews say it is. 

The croissants themselves are to die for. They&apos;re so buttery and fluffy and flaky! The ham and cheese melt perfectly in your mouth, and the chocolate almond satisfies any sweet tooth cravings you have. I would highly recommend eating your croissant immediately, since it does deflate a little the next day. Theres usually a crowd of people scattered near the corner eating, so there&apos;s no shame in sitting right outside the bakery and enjoying your meal! 

Warning that there is a really long line though. We came right before 11:30AM on a Saturday, and had to wait in line for 40 minutes."
5,"Two words: worth it. Arsicault is worth the wait. The line is usually long at the weekend, but it goes by pretty quickly. They&apos;ve got their process down to a T. By the time you swipe your card, they&apos;re ready to hand you your pastries. 

The only regret I have is not coming here sooner. They make some of the best croissants I&apos;ve ever had. In my opinion, their best croissant is the almond croissant. It&apos;s flakey, crispy (yet soft), and sweet (but not too sweet). After I&apos;ve eaten it, I&apos;m sad it&apos;s over. 

If you have a big sweet tooth, the almond chocolate croissant will definitely satiate. If you prefer something savory, go for the ham and cheese. If you like it all, go for all of the above."
5,"I went here on a Thursday at around 8:25am. The line was at least 10 people long and I was able to get to the front of the line with my pastries in hand by 8:36. Crazy how fast they are! I love that. I ordered the ham and cheese croissant, the chocolate almond croissant, and the kouign amann. Here are my ratings. 

Ham and cheese croissant - 5/5. So extremely good! It costed $5.75. It had a good amount of cheese and ham in it and the croissant itself had the loveliest texture. It was light and buttery on the inside and crispy on the outside. A very savory croissant! 

Chocolate almond croissant - 5/5. $5.75. This croissant is definitely a dessert one. Filled with both chocolate and almond cream? Paste? Not sure but it&apos;s really good. The chocolate is best when warm when it&apos;s nice and gooey. I took a bite of the croissant cold and it&apos;s weird to have a chunk of hard chocolate in the croissant. So I highly recommend it air fried if it&apos;s cold. Same soft and buttery inside and crunchy outside. This can get a little bit sweet, so enjoy it with a cup of coffee. Or eat half and save the other for later! 

Kouign amann - 3/5. $4.25 This was pretty basic. I definitely recommend b patisserie&apos;s version compared to this one. This tasted just like the regular croissant with caramelized sugar on top. Good but wouldn&apos;t get it again. I&apos;d come here for the croissants!

Overall, I will definitely be purchasing more pastries from here."
5,"I remembered vividly the first time I bit into this Ham &amp; Cheese Croissant, hot and fresh out of the oven.

As the warm, airy, fragrantly buttery and flaky layers crumbled into my mouth, I simultaneously teleported to Paris and transcended to heaven. From that moment on, I became a member of the ArsiCULT.

Ps - they always bake throughout the day, so you&apos;ll get fresh pastries no matter what time you show up"
5,Amazing! The flaky tasty layers. No wonder the line is down the block. Ham and cheese croissant was a nice sized portion and the flavor was spectacular. I popped it in the microwave for 15 seconds and it was super tasty.
5,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this bakery. 

Last week, I was craving a chocolate croissant like the kind I used to have at Bakery Nouveau in Seattle. Dare I say, the chocolate croissant from Ariscault Bakery was even better. The outside was fried and crispy, and the inside was the most delightful mix of chocolate and gooey deliciousness. The croissant was also larger than average, and topped with an abundant layer of powdered sugar. YUM. 

My partner tried the coffee, and said it was &quot;better than Starbucks&quot;, so I wouldn&apos;t visit expecting coffee-roaster quality. However, the baked goods were so impressive that we can ignore that.

COVID precautions: Ariscault has a good Covid set up, with the cashier standing in the doorway so that you don&apos;t have to set inside the building. Expect a line - we arrived before 9am on a rainy Saturday, and waited about 10 minutes."
4,"Came by on a Monday around 2:30pm. There was a short line, but it moved quickly. I got an almond croissant (not pictured), a chocolate croissant, a regular croissant, a kouign amann, and chocolate pearl sables.

The croissants and kouign amann had a crisp, flaky exterior and a buttery, fluffy interior. They were amazing. I recommend heating the chocolate croissant up, to get an ooey gooey center. Kouign amann was probably my favorite because it had a good balance of sweetness. The almond croissant was just too sweet for me. 

Sable was good, super buttery and it just melts. Not too sweet, and the amount can last you a good while.

Arsicault had the best croissant texture I&apos;ve ever had. I&apos;ll definitely be back whenever I want a croissant."
5,"If you are looking for the best croissants in the city, look no further. I am not a croissant fan, per se, but my gf is and so I have by this time tried my fair share. Arsicault wins easily. Their chocolate croissant is the Platonic ideal of its type. Flaky, buttery goodness, with just enough chocolate to make bring the pastry into decadence but not so much that it&apos;s cloyingly sweet. Get this warm. 

I&apos;ve tasted some of their other offerings, as well. The ham and cheese croissant has all the balance of the chocolate, but in a less sweet form. So if savory is what you&apos;re looking for (or you&apos;re looking to rationalize your consumption of buttery goodness by consuming some protein with it), this will work just fine. 

The chocolate almond croissant was a mind-blower. The chocolate and almond fillings were balanced and the combination of both in the same bite sent me into a quasi-meditative reverie. It might be the best croissant I ever had (although the concept of duality exploded in the aforementioned reverie). This is a sumptuous and very rich pastry and I could not have finished it on my own (and I have an appetite) - so plan to share. The only critique I might have about this little delight is that it was a bit moist on the bottom. But that is minor for the goodness it packs (and may also be attributable to us buying it hot and having in a bag longer than was ideal). I still totally recommend it. 

Some logistical notes: I have never seen the line that was not long here, so plan for that. Perhaps to expedite movement of the line, they have ceased making espresso drinks (serving only drip coffee). I see this as not only good organization, but also being a good neighbor. Breck&apos;s café is right next door, does a range of caffeinated beverages (as well as wine if you&apos;re pairing that with croissants), and has some very lovely people working there. So what I would like to suggest is coming with at least one other person, so one of you can wait in line to get the carbs while the other picks up the caffeine. Your morning really can&apos;t go wrong."
5,"This bakery has quite possibly the best croissants I&apos;ve ever had in San Francisco. Flaky, perfectly layered, buttery, and decadent, the chocolate almond croissant is the king of this bakery. If you&apos;re only going to get one, GET. THIS. ONE. The lines are long, but I promise the wait is worth it, and it goes by pretty quickly. The ham and cheese croissant and the morning bun are really yummy also!"
4,"I&apos;m not big on pastries, but wow this was the best ham &amp; cheese croissant I&apos;ve ever had in my life! Warm, fresh, and SO flaky, fluffy, and light. Mm, it just melts in your mouth!! Their coconut cranberry scone was also delicious and had just the right amount of sweetness to it. 

Very easy to grab and go with an assortment of pastries to choose from. You can even pick up coffee next door after! The line may look long as it goes down the block, but it goes fairly fast! The setup is very efficient despite the extra protocols needed.

Would recommend this to any pastry lover!"
5,"Yaaaay!! I got to stop by Friday morning around 10:30am with only 8 people in line!! I&apos;ve had Arsicault multiple times before where friends or family would bring to a gathering (pre-covid). I had to check the place out myself though

You can smell the buttery pillowy crispy croissants from a block away

I ordered:

-Chocolate almond croissants: always my favorite with so much almond paste and chocolate, flakey and crispy

-Ham and Cheese croissants: probably hands down one of the best croissants anywhere. I don&apos;t know how they do it, but even though this croissant has a good amount of ham and cheese it can still stay so light and airy

-Morning bun: made up of cinnamon and sugar layers, so crispy on the outside soft on the in

-kouign-amann: so crispy on top with tons of layers inside

Yums yums check it out"
