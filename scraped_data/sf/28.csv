5,"Probably the best egg tarts I&apos;ve ever had--the reviews don&apos;t lie! $2.50 is a hefty price to pay for a single tart compared to the sub $1 counterparts in other Chinatown bakeries, but absolutely worth it. They are huge! And warm, slightly underbaked (just the way I like it), and sweet and creamy. 

The wait can be long and I&apos;ve heard that the opening schedule can be rather inconsistent (as in, check to see if they&apos;re open before making the trip), but if yes then definitely make the trip. Also, cash only!"
5,"THIS is the reason that I kind of wish I lived on the West Coast. I came here during my trip in the beginning of the year and Golden Gate popped up on every recommendation list from my friends. I had heard that they are randomly closed for vacation and that it was likely I wouldn&apos;t be able to get my hands on some of those golden tarts.

Thankfully, they were opened the morning I stopped by and the line was not that long. However, I didn&apos;t realize it was cash only until I saw the sign at the door but there&apos;s a Chase right across the street so my sister just ran over and got some cash, no problem.

We got half a dozen and we each had one right outside while it was still hot and fresh. It was the most delicious egg tart I have ever had. The custard melts in your mouth and the crust is flaky and buttery. Even when we ate them the day after, they were still delicious. Definitely recommend!"
5,"*Note 1: I bought these pre-Stay-at-Home order. Please practice social distancing and stay home when possible!*
*Note 2: CASH ONLY*
*Note 3: This post is about their 蛋挞*

Do you remember in Toy Story 2 when Woody had that nightmare that Andy dropped him, stared off into the distance and as if he was in a trance said coldly &quot;I don&apos;t want to play with you anymore&quot;? Yeah, so when it comes to Golden Gate Bakery and their 蛋挞 (egg tarts) we the consumers are Woody and they&apos;re Andy. They literally close and open and go on multiweek vacations whenever they want because they can and they know that the moment their doors open, we&apos;ll be there waiting to bring home another pink box (or 5) filled with their 蛋挞. I&apos;ve travelled across the land (okay I&apos;ve flown from coast to coast) searching far and wide and I have yet to find 蛋挞 as good or as quality as theirs and at such a price point too! I don&apos;t know how they do it but their custard is excellent (neither too sweet nor eggy), their crust is just present enough to not overpower nor be overpowered by the custard, and the crunch and mouth fill from a single bite is just perfection. Grab a box if you can when you find them open (and let me know so I can come by for one too!)!"
4,"I always look forward to coming here when I visit San Francisco for the egg tart!  All the other times I have visited here there were no lines but this time it seemed like a good 30-45 minute wait as once the egg tarts come out of the oven, people order them by the dozen and it runs out real quick and the line and wait time gets longer again until the next batch.

My husband got smart and and asked a very kind lady in front of the line to purchase 2 egg tarts for us because we needed to rush to the airport to catch our flight.  She obliged and we bypassed the line and enjoyed our hot, fresh out of the oven egg tarts in less than 5 minutes wait time (LOL, we did get some evil stares from people who were still waiting in line when they realized what my husband did)!

The egg tarts are delicious but this is the first time I am able to compare the egg tarts here and at Lido Restaurant in Richmond, BC when both are still fresh in my mind and palate.  Lido wins as Golden Gate is lacking the egg flavor Lido had in its egg tarts.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, Golden Gate egg tarts are still very good and I will continue coming here as it is a lot closer to me than having to cross the Canadian border...but, just saying, Lido is better."
4,"Come here for the egg tarts! I did not actually get the egg tart from the bakery myself, my friend gave it to me because of their weird hours! They are always &quot;on vacation&quot; and you never know when they will be open. The two times I&apos;ve walked by myself, they haven&apos;t been open :(

The egg tart is perfectly flaky/buttery, and the egg custard is jiggly, soft, and delicious!

I don&apos;t go to Chinese bakeries that often, so I don&apos;t have anything to compare it to, but this one was very good!

Golden Gate Bakery is a must when you are in Chinatown!"
4,"GGB is synonymous with egg tarts.  It&apos;s the claim to fame for the most famous bakery in SF&apos;s Chinatown.  But open the aperture​ and you&apos;ll find so much more!  Think macaroons, sachima (a Chinese version of Rice Krispie treats), various tarts,​ and all kinds of Asian desserts. 

I was here for the mooncakes​.  &apos;Tis the season!  This is one of two places I&apos;ve been coming to forever for traditional mooncakes.  In Asia, mooncakes are enjoyed during the mid-Autumn Festival, which usually lasts​ about a month.  It culminates when the moon is fullest, on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar.   This year, it landed on 10/1.

Traditionally in Asia, families get together and enjoy mooncakes outdoors at night and look for the mythological &quot;moon lady&quot; who supposedly resides on the moon and is visible on the night of the full moon.  Many versions of this myth exist​ and the famous author, Amy Tan, even wrote a book about this (check out my pic. below).  

Mooncakes are rich and decadent, similar to cheesecakes and are an acquired taste.  They&apos;re typically filled with a lotus or bean paste and often with nuts and egg yolks.  My favorite is the simple lotus paste ones with an egg yolk.  There&apos;re also some really fancy and colorful ones now, like yellow durian, purple taro,​ and even matcha green flavored ones.  GGB carries the old school kind, not the nouveau fancy ones.  The mooncakes here are solid!  Even though mooncakes are notoriously high in fat, these aren&apos;t nearly as oily as ones you&apos;ll find in other bakeries.  Also, even though you can buy boxed mooncakes at Asian markets,  I prefer them baked fresh from a reputable bakery like this, without all the preservatives.

Getting anything here is quite a Herculean accomplishment.  It&apos;s common for GGB to be &quot;on vacation&quot; at random days and sometimes for more than 3 weeks in a row.  Isn&apos;t it nice to be so wildly successful that you can kick back and operate your bakery more as if it&apos;s a hobby?!  
If you can catch them when they&apos;re actually open, be prepared for a looong wait!  Lines can be well over an hour long and move very slooowly!!  I got one of the last boxes of the popular lotus paste ones, but the less popular ones are still available (nuts &amp; ham, winter melon, etc.).  

As for the infamous egg tarts, they&apos;re good if you can score some when they&apos;re still warm and jiggly.  They&apos;re not always consistent, but if you can catch a good batch, they&apos;re excellent!  Not nearly as good as you&apos;ll find in Asia, but easily wins out over most places in the Bay Area, where they&apos;re usually mediocre to subpar.

Currently, they&apos;re only selling moon cakes.  However,  the macaroons and sachima&apos;s are really good too.  People come for the egg tarts, but there&apos;s actually a lot of other things they do well.  

GGB is definitely worth trying if you&apos;ve never been, but bring your patience along with you.  ​And bring cash too.  It&apos;s cash only.

PRO TIP:  No one&apos;s allowed inside the tiny bakery during the pandemic, so if you&apos;re not familiar with what they have, check out the Yelp photos in advance.  There&apos;s a menu posted on the door but no accompanying pics."
2,"Highly overrated! I heard a lot of good things about this place, and it always has a long line! I was lucky enough that there was no line when I arrived. I bought an egg tart, which is what they are famous for! WOW, $2.5 for an egg tart (over-price for sure)! If it costs this much, the egg tart better be good! Unfortunately, I can tell that it was over-baked by the way it looks! the surface was not smooth. Feeling sad. It is warm and fresh, but nothing worth $2.5 each! 

I guess when you have nothing to compare, this is the best place for egg tarts (I am sorry to say that I am a baker. I am proud to say that i bake better egg tarts than this place, and I don&apos;t charge $2.5 per egg tart)!"
1,Not sure what the hype is about.  Taste like a regular egg tart and so pricey too.  And you also never know when they&apos;re open either since they don&apos;t follow regular days / hours
4,"Amazing egg tarts! Nice, flaky crust and an eggy custard. Only downsides are 1) the price and 2) the unpredictable hours. Do not go by the hours listed on Yelp. On the day of, the owners post a piece of paper to their door which tells you the true business hours of that day. This sucks cause it&apos;s hard to plan your visits. Also, they only accept cash so be prepared."
5,"Golden Gate Bakery is a great place to get what I call...&quot;Cheap-N-Cheerful&quot; Chinese dim-sum as well as tasty Baked goods as well as Cakes &amp; Pastries!
!"
5,"My wife and I love this place! The egg tart is to die for... theyre a tad pricey but worth every penny, my brother-in-law lives pretty close and I cannot resist to drop by when I&apos;m on a run with my dog....  his mouth even waters when I buy a tart!"
4,"Loved the moon cake I got! I chose the lotus seed paste with one egg yolk and it was perfectly lush and rich with the right combination of savory saltiness from the egg yolk with the sweet richness from the lotus seed paste. Can&apos;t wait to try their famous egg tarts which should be back by 10/10! Cash only

Update 10/10: went at around 9am and the store was not open, no signs either"
5,"This place is definitely worth checking out if you&apos;re in San Francisco! Although they do sell various baked goods, they are most known for their delicious golden yellow egg tarts! They make their egg tarts fresh and this bakery continually has fresh batches of them coming out of the oven. 

Despite the long line, me and my friends only waited about 30 minutes before we got to the front. When we finally got to the front, there are signs around the store that states the cost of the various items. The ladies were super cute and happy because we were trying to take pictures of their fresh egg tarts on the tray. 

The egg tarts go for $2.75 per tart. We bought two dozen and they packaged them in a cute pink box! 

When we tried them, they were super delicious! A crispy, buttery, and flaky crust on the outside that melts in your mouth, followed by a fluffy warm custard that doesn&apos;t overwhelm your mouth with egg taste. I&apos;m drooling just thinking about it! 

It was definitely worth the experience and I would come back if I&apos;m ever around the area!"
1,Love their egg custards but it is a pain to get your hand on them.  Are they open today or not?!?
4,"Wow... just WOW! This bakery serves the most delicious Hong Kong custard egg tarts I&apos;ve ever had. I&apos;ve been coming to this location for the past few years specifically for the egg tarts, and man oh man... they never disappoint me! 

The dough is very crispy and the custard is super flavorful, yet it is not too sweet -- it&apos;s just right. You don&apos;t want to eat your egg tarts right away because it can be super hot! 

Parking isn&apos;t the best in Chinatown, let alone San Francisco itself. It usually takes a few minutes for me to find parking either on a different street or down the street. Either way, I always find myself walking to the bakery after I park. Also, be ready to wait in line -- it can get pretty long but it usually moves pretty fast! 

You must be wondering why I left 4 stars instead of 5, well the owners always happen to be on &quot;vacation&quot; at the most random times. You&apos;ll never know when they are closed or open. In fact, there is a website called: is-the-golden-gate-bakery-open-today.com. I suggest checking it out but they have been really bad at updating it lately."
5,"I called and they said they are taking preorders for moon cakes and that they won&apos;t have the dan tats until about 2 weeks later. This was on 9/17/20.

Disappointed because I was visiting from LA. I was hoping to bring some back home. I still haven&apos;t found anything like it back in so cal."
5,"As many people have mentioned before, the bakery opens at pretty random times and can go on extended vacations whenever. There&apos;s a website that does claim to track when it&apos;s open, but even that sometimes isn&apos;t the most accurate. Even when the bakery is open, the line can get pretty long and you&apos;ll be waiting upwards of 20-30 minutes. However, it does live up to the hype of having the best egg custards in all of SF and probably the Bay Area as well. The store itself is very small, and as a result the line will stretch down the street outside of it.

    The egg tart itself is significantly thicker than other egg tarts that I&apos;ve had and they serve it hot so that it melts in your mouth. It&apos;s made in fresh batches, so it will be really soft and have all of its flavor preserved. The crust can be flaky, so make sure you eat outside or somewhere where you wouldn&apos;t mind the crumbs falling.

    I think that this place is definitely worth checking out at least once to see what all the hype is about. However, since it opens only at random times and always has long lines I probably won&apos;t go out of my way to go back regularly."
5,"Fluffy flaky butter crust and a creamy eggy filling! I honestly love their egg tarts! 

2.75 per egg tart or 33 for a dozen. They package them in pink boxes for you if you get the dozen. 

The last time I came they were freshly made and super yummy! Coming later in the day on the weekday there was barely any line!"
4,"The quest for acquiring a coveted Golden Gate Bakery egg tart builds character--you need patience to check on the elusive opening hours (not to mention patience for parking), patience to wait in the long and quickly growing line, patience in waiting for the egg tarts to cool down despite inhaling the wafts of buttery goodness... It&apos;s the ultimate test of delayed gratification. 

There&apos;s a reason why GGB is so famous despite the erratic hours and perpetual wait. There even exists the website www.is-the-golden-gate-bakery-open-today.com although it isn&apos;t always updated and accurate.

Growing up myself with a mindset that an egg tart is a simple snack just like a Twinkie at the grocery store or a cookie at the mall, I initially dismissed the idea that there would be so much craziness from locals and tourists alike over something I deemed to be the basic egg tart. 

But one day as I passed by noticed that the stated hours fit my schedule, I decided to check it out and arrived 10 minutes prior to their posted opening time of 1pm. It looked empty inside and I saw no signs of life nor egg tarts. Other passers-by looked at the sign and pondered; before I knew it, I saw a long line form behind me.

My only complaint is that there were a few people who cut the line--I think they had pre-ordered and/or knew the business owners. In any case, I feel like it&apos;s more fair to everyone to wait in line since you only need to arrive ~10 minutes before opening time. 

At $2.75 per egg tart, it was pricier than I had expected but definitely very reasonable for a legendary egg tart (especially in a city that boasts $7 croissants *cough cough Tartine*). The pricing doesn&apos;t change based on quantity, and most people order at least a half dozen. Because it was so delicious and a relatively light snack, I easily devoured two in one afternoon. GGB has a quintessential local family-business-owned vibe, and the lady taking orders was very friendly and efficient. 

Now for the million-dollar-question of what is so magical about the GGB egg tart: every component has been perfected. Every. Single. Crumb. 
1. The crust has a beautiful flakiness that rivals craft croissants
2. The textures contrast between the exterior crispiness and the soft velvety filling
3. The custard is light yet creamy, as if it were scooped straight ouf of a batch of 燉蛋 (Chinese steamed egg dessert)

To put it simply: when you finally bite into your hard-earned egg tart, the structure of the egg tart implodes, and the flavors explode.

Surely, Golden Gate Bakery teaches you to enjoy the simple things in life. The simple egg tart is rendered into a masterpiece, and you learn that patience is indeed a virtue."
5,"Before I had a single bite I had a wave of nostalgia wash over me as I saw the faded pink boxes with the red ribbon string. I remember coming here on a field trip when I was just a wee boy...crazy to see that the operation has stayed more or less the same over the years.

Also love how unphased the Chinese ladies are when people ask for 50 egg tarts. Without batting an eye or acknowledging the order they start throwing egg tarts into those boxes with such accuracy and speed. Thought this was a given but BRING CASH...recently had a friend that made the trek without any bills and don&apos;t be deterred by the lines - it moves quickly.

Oh and one box is definitely NOT enough!"
