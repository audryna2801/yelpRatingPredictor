1,"The manager of the building was very nice at the beginning. After I moved in, I had problem with wifi all the time and I explained him one modem is not enough for 20 people. I didn&apos;t even complain about the disgusting bathroom and so on even I am paying 1400 USD per month for a tiny little room. He said no one is complaining I cannot do anything. Then he got pissed because there was cinnamon in the kitchen cupboard and he said you are gonna make me get disease!? Like seriously ? He insulted me questioning my intelligence just bec I didn&apos;t understand one word he used just bec im not NATIVE SPEAKER! God keep this country away from these ignorant people!

One more thing! There are 70 80 years old people are living and they do complain about young people even though you dont do anything annoying. It is a sick place!"
