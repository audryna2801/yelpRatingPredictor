5,"When we came here on a Saturday afternoon (1:30 pm), there was a long line of maybe than 10 people in front. Thankfully it moved very fast and we were inside within 15 minutes. They have a system of letting 2 people in at a time at separate but identical display cases, where you pick out your baked goods then move to another line to pay. The system was very well organized, the bakery was very clean, and the staff were all very patient and friendly. 

The smell inside of the bakery was so good that it seeped through our masks! We eagerly bought almost one of everything.

The Kouign Amann is famous for a reason, and I recommend everyone try it. It is extremely flaky, buttery, and sweet (from the layer of syrup inside). 
The Chocolate Banana Almond Croissant! Oh my gosh the banana is so tender but the outside of the croissant is so flaky and it was amazing. If you enjoy banana pastries definitely give this one a go. 
These two above were the best for me but the Apple Tart and the Oatmeal Raisin Cookie were also good. The only misses were the madeleines, which were very thick and heavy, and the passion bostock (has a very strong passion fruit flavor if you&apos;re into that!). For the cakes, I tried the black sesame, milk tea, matcha and blurberry lemon, and although they tasted nice it felt like I was just eating cream. 

I&apos;ve tried some of the others, but I thought these were the ones worth mentioning. I&apos;ll definitely be coming back fro more kougin amanns and banana croissants!"

Saturday 1 hour before closing! There was a 10 minute wait, three outdoor dining tables, and open metered street parking!

...

// Passionfruit Bostock (Seasonal) $3.75

We got this upon recommendation because it was FRESH out the oven and still WARM! The passionfruit flavor was strong and acidic. It paired SO WELL with the sweet buttery cake! The passionfruit really shined and complemented the buttery cake. Outside was crispy crunchy and the inside soft warm and so very moist!

// Chocolate Almond Banana Croissant $4.50

This is no regular croissant! It is crusted with a delicious sugary craquelin like coating and topped with sliced almonds! This croissant is FILLED to the MAX. Oftentimes croissants with filling have a HUGE gaping hole with the tiny bit of filling at the bottom. But at B Patisserie that gaping hole is instead STUFFED TO THE BRIM! You can also taste ALL three flavors: banana, chocolate, almond. The chocolate tasted almost like nutella! The flavors blended so well. If you can&apos;t eat it right away I highly recommend warming this up!

// Kouign Amann $4.25
This kouign amann BLEW MY MIND. Crispy crunchy flaky caramel-y layers yet there is a moist soft almost custard like interior. Best kouign amann and I think the cheapest I&apos;ve seen! South Bay bakers are charging $5+ for KAs!

...

~ S E R V I C E ~
There is a man at the front queuing customers and monitoring the number of customers in the store. I really appreciate this! Also they allowed us to use their restroom which is a BIG DEAL during pandemic life. Public restrooms are so hard to come by.

...

~ O V E R A L L ~
Always get the seasonal flavors, they&apos;re amazing! Always get the Kouign Amann, they&apos;re amazing! Always bring home a HUGE big box, they&apos;re amazing! Next time we are PRE-ORDERING. It cuts the wait! This is WORTH the price, WORTH the drive, WORTH the wait. JUST GO ALREADY."
5,"WOW WOW WOW! B Patisserie definitely lives up to the hype. If I had the option to choose a few things to bring with me on a deserted island, I would easily choose a lifetime supply of B Patisserie&apos;s Kouign-Amans! YES. These buttery, flakey, caramel-y confections are THAT GOOD. Just thinking about them late at night is making me salivate. It&apos;s almost similar to a croissant but way better. Kouign Amans are more dense, caramelized layers + exterior and has a nice center. The crunch of these things will lay you down! Props to them for making a difficult pastry on a daily basis-- I&apos;m sure they can tell it is worth all the hard work seeing how crazy people go over them! I seriously wished we bought more Pandan and Black Sesame Kouign Amans to bring home with us since we loved them so much. Stephanie was super friendly and made sure our first experience was delightful.

OTHER STUFF TO KNOW: 
- All enforced and put into use
- Store is clean 
- Outdoor seating (3) tables available outside
- Online ordering available 
- Street &amp; Meter Parking, kind of tough but is expected in SF.

In conclusion, I highly recommend B Patisserie to everyone to try if you are in the area. Next time, we&apos;ll make sure not to make the mistake of just ordering two pastries and actually bring some
home! So glad knowing that coming here was worth the drive."
5,"When you come here, you must try the Kouign Amann!

Each bite is filled with an extra flaky and crispy goodness! To celebrate Lunar New Year, they always push out a special menu. Definitely do not miss the Sesame Kougin Amann! It&apos;s seriously one of my favorites.

Besides the Kouigan Amann, I&apos;m also a huge fan of:
Passion Fruit Bostock- crispy on the outside, passion fruit flavor inside
Banna Chocolate Almond Croissants- love how their so flaky!
Seasonal Almond Crossiants
They also have cakes as well! They &quot;7 cake in one&quot; pictured in the second picture on the left was definitely one of a kind. It was a mixture of 7 cakes in basically three bites!

I&apos;m so glad they expanded their hours. I was getting withdrawal symptoms."
4,"I love that you can pre-order on the website. 
Then when you arrive,  just head to the much shorter pre-order line to pick up your prepaid order ; ) 
My favorite item was the flavorful Gingerbread cake, filled with wonderful spices! 
The &quot;All in One Cake&quot; was an interesting idea. I&apos;m just not sure it really worked. 
Overall, everything was well executed!
I still have not replaced my favorite bakery with this one, but it was nice to have a sampling of what they offer since this was my first visit, and I have been wanting to try them ; )"
5,"Friday AM and there was a line!

It&apos;s February 2021. Still donning masks and standing six feet apart, I stand in line with eight customers ahead of me.

Why I wait!
+ The line moves at a good pace. There is someone at the door that guides the next customer to avoid overcrowding.
+ Pastries deliver. So many variety and new creations are available everyday. But watch for debuts on special dates like National Kouign Amann Day.
+ Special pastries. There are Chinese fusion pastries for Year of the Ox: Tiger Sugar Tapioca Pudding is my fave; pandan or black sesame Kouign Amanns work; Coconut Red Bean Tart hits the key flavors but not my fave. Limited offering.
+ Preorders are the way to go to beat the line. But online orders close from Friday to Sunday. Closed Monday and Tuesday but check website for latest."
5,"I will always be grateful to B Patisserie for introducing me to the amazing pastry that is the kouign amann. B Patisserie&apos;s kouign amann is tied with Arsicault&apos;s almond croissant as my favorite pastry in the city (quite possibly the world to be honest). If you&apos;ve had Arsicault&apos;s almond croissant, then you know just how big of a statement this is.

If you get the chance to enjoy the pandan flavored one, you can&apos;t not get one. Heck, get yourself two. You won&apos;t regret it."
5,"Have I really not left a review for this spot?! I could swear I have left at least three. Well, since I can&apos;t find it, here goes:  Ignore the &quot;must get this, must get that.&quot; Rather walk in, take a deep breath from completing the long queue behind you (that&apos;s done now) (better yet, just don&apos;t go on the weekends) take a look at the case, and go for what your hearts says, as your heart will never lead you astray. At least here anyhow, because everything is friggin&apos; good!
Remember to (try and) save some room for the nice tartine open-face sandwiches (if they are available, lately they have not) and grab a coffee-- get decaf even if you don&apos;t like caffeine, you gotta try their cappuccino-- I don&apos;t even drink coffee regularly, but this one is worth it. After eating here, I often ponder how the USA bakeries of the 70s, 80s, even the 90s and early 2000s strayed so far from the French roots of making good pastries. Like wtf happened here during those dark ages of American baking, and why do so many crap bakeries still exist? Anyhow, without getting too esoteric here, let me thank the founder, Belinda Leong, the staff and crew and everyone else for raising the bar. Great job!"
5,"B Patisserie is one of my favorite bakeries in the city. They have so many types of pastries to pick from. You can find classic flavors to seasonal flavors that are only there for a limited time.

Some of the best tries at the bakery:

Any of the kouign amann available. The mango passionfruit is my current favorite. It&apos;s sweet with strong notes of mango and Passionfruit. The pastries are flaky with a crunch on the outside. Highly recommended.

The chocolate banana almond croissant. It&apos;s more of a twice baked croissant. But I love the generous amount of chocolate and bananas that fill the croissant.

The blueberry lime cheesecake. I was hesitant to try this one since I&apos;m not the biggest fan of tart flavors. But it was just a hint of citrus. The cheesecake was slightly sweet and relatively light. Sooo good.

They have a good amount of pastries in the display case for walk ins. But if you don&apos;t want to wait. Definitely order ahead online and pick up at the store. They have separate lines for pick ups and walk ins."
5,"Lunar new year brings out all the best desserts! @bpatisserie has been doing lunar new year specials for years and one of my fav is the black sesame Kouign Amann. They have layers of black sesame in the pastry, not just the center. Makes it extra delicious to eat!

This year they also have Pandan but they didn&apos;t layer it like the black sesame. 

I also had a chance to try black sesame tiramisu and red bean coconut tart! Both were So delicious!! 

The only downside is dealing with the long lines since everyone is crazy about these lunar new year specials. They let you preorder earlier in the week for pick up on the weekend. You can also pick your time slot but be prepared to wait a while still."
5,"Yummmmmm. B Patisserie is still open and poppin&apos; during COVID. They offer online ordering as late as an hour before, which is convenient when most others require a day&apos;s notice at least. 

Everything is as gorgeous and fresh as ever. Kouign aman is light and flaky all the way through and they have a delish mango version. The banana-chocolate-almond croissant is denser than you&apos;d expect a croissant to be because of the topping, but that just adds to the decadence. Their viennoiserie and patisserie is pricey ($5+ and $7+ respectively) and given the size I&apos;d say the viennoiserie is more worth it."
5,"I tried B Patisserie years ago, and though I was impressed with their kouign amann pastries, I didn&apos;t crave them frequently.  When I saw they&apos;d be putting together pastry boxes for San Ramon, I jumped on the opportunity to partake without driving into the city.  The pastry box included an assortment of kouign amanns, bostocks, croissants, chocolate chip cookies, and scones.  They also offered granola.

Quite frankly, I was confused and intrigued with the granola.  So I ordered it.  And it was the most amazing granola I have ever had in my life.  There&apos;s a nice nutty flavor with a lovely crispness (but not overboard where it hurts your teeth).  While I&apos;m sure it&apos;s great as a topping to yogurt, etc., I just eat it plain so I can savor it.

Their chocolate chip cookies are also great.  I&apos;ve been to other &quot;fancy&quot; bakeries where their cookies pale in comparison to everything else, but B Patisserie shows strength across everything they offer."
5,"TOP 10 BAKERIES IN SF (on my list)

SO DAMN GOOD. FLAKY AF.

I&apos;ve been coming here for years. It&apos;s just delicious. A baker myself I&apos;m pretty discerning when it comes to sweets especially pastries. Everything is fresh and delicious time after time. I always get:

1. Kouign (queen) Amann (all flavors)
2. Banana Chocolate Almond Croix
3. Seasonal Almond Croix

Everything else is good too. But those are the ones that stand out and are the best in the city. The other bakery that has great Almond Croix is Neighbor bakehouse.  If calories didn&apos;t count I would be there 2x daily."
5,"Preordered the lunar new year items because they sounded so good! 

Black sesame Kouign Amann - 5/5 This was delicious! Had the perfect taste of sweet black sesame paste and their always exceptional kouign amann. Crunchy on the outside with the nice caramelized sugar. Soooo good. 

Pandan kouign amann - 5/5 I did not know what pandan tasted like and I&apos;m still not sure I know. But I have to say this was delicious! The custard had a coconutty flavor to it and I loved it with the kouign amann. 

Tiger sugar tapioca pudding - 2/5 This was pretty mediocre for me. And at 7 dollars kinda pricey for it not being mind blowing. It had sago mixed in with brown sugar pudding. Wasn&apos;t too sweet but just wasn&apos;t my thing. Maybe because pudding is so one noted? Would be really good with cake in there too!

Milk tea cake - 3/5. Unique. But also didn&apos;t blow me away. Small portion but that&apos;s usually what it&apos;s like for a place like this. Has a pretty strong milk tea flavor which was nice! The slight bitterness from the tea really contrasted well with the sweetness. The bottom part is more of a pie crust consistency than cake. Which I would have preferred a cake texture. 

I haven&apos;t opened the milk tea jam yet so no rating for that!

I highly suggest preordering this stuff rather than going there to get it. The line for walk in was suuuuper long. And there was no line for pick up only. It was great. Do yourself a favor and pick up these goodies!"
5,"I don&apos;t know how I haven&apos;t rated B Patisserie yet but let me tell you, after my pandan kouign-amann the other day, I fell back in love.

Everything is great. I don&apos;t know what else to tell you. You cannot go wrong with a pastry here. They also change it up on you all the time - different croissant flavors, different kouign-amanns, and the coffee isn&apos;t half bad either.

During COVID, there&apos;s a pre order line and a walk up line. I have not visited on the weekend, but during the day, you can walk in just fine. There&apos;s three tables outside so if you&apos;re planning on snacking outside, good luck.

FYI - The sandwiches have moved to b on the g across the street now.

Order everything that looks good and you won&apos;t go wrong."
4,"Minus 1 star bcuz 3 of pandan kouign aman have only the filling on the top, not inside, less than 1 small tea spoon.

The mandarin tart : 5 stars
Not too sour, just right.

Back sesame tiramisu : 5 stars
but I like the black sesame cheesecake from last year more.

Mango Pudding : 3 stars
nothing special.

Milk tea cake : 4 stars
not strong milk tea taste, strong condensed milk taste.

Red bean coconut tart : 3 stars
for coconut lover. Can&apos;t taste the red beans.

Black sesame Kouign Aman : 5 stars
Perfect flaky, not too sweet.

Pandan Kouign Aman : 3 stars
feel like the plain Kouign Aman just a little pandan cream on top"
5,"It only takes one try to give a perfect 5 out 5 star review. I cannot believe that I have just tried this awesome place! This is definitely a high end patisserie / bakery, but it is all worth the extra $$! If you haven&apos;t tried it, you are missing out!

Here are the goodies I&apos;ve tried:
Ham &amp; Cheese Croissant
Chocolate Kouign Amann
Chocolate Banana Almond Croissant
Mini Walnut Chocolate Chip Cookie
Mini Almond Cookie
Mini Oatmeal Cherry Toffee Cookie

COVID-19 Considerations:
Hand sanitizer is available literally everywhere
Everyone is required to wear a mask (putting the mask over the nose is definitely re-enforced
The gentleman who manages the capacity and lines maintain 6 feet physical distancing with customers
All staff wear a mask properly"
4,"Simply delicious!

I finally had a chance to visit the famous B Patisserie and it did not disappoint. I came on a Saturday morning and the line was very, very long. It took about 20-minutes to reach the door. They do take online orders for easy pick-up; however, in researching their online menu, it DOES NOT contain all of the pastries they have available, so if you want to see all your options, order in-person.

My girlfriend and I tried the apple almond croissant ($4.50), banana chocolate almond croissant ($4.50), passionfruit bostock ($3.50), and quiche ($4)! Yes... it is pricey, but the quality is worth it. We loved the passionfruit bostock. So moist, delicate, and not too sweet. Our other favorite was the banana chocolate almond croissant. I recommend sharing so you try a variety of items. The quiche was great - but it was cold, so definitely heat it up when you get home.

Why 4-stars? Customer service could have been better for such a popular and successful bakery. Since it was our first time, we weren&apos;t familiar with the display and ordering process (during COVID, there are two identical display cases with two parties ordering at the same time). The workers seemed a bit burnt out (I understand working at a bakery is exhausting) but the experience still seemed a bit cold and unwelcoming.

There is street metered parking for I believe $2.50 an hour."
5,"This is my favorite bakery in SF. Kinda pricey but worth it. I spend money here more than I spend in the restaurant for the whole meal. Because the pastry is that good.

The service not that nice, but I come here for the pastry not the service."
4,"Came here on a Sunday morning/afternoon to walk in and order some pastries. We got the following
- All In One Cake
- The Flan
- Banana Almond Croissant
- Black Sesame Kouign Amann 

By the time we reached they were out of all savory items. Their drink menu is sparse if you&apos;re looking for options to pair with your pastries. I had a voucher and did get a free drip coffee which was decent.

The flan is definitely a French flan and is lighter and fluffier than traditional Spanish flan. The different layers in the All In One cake are distinct and a great way to discern what might be your favorite and next buy. We haven&apos;t tried the other two yet but I&apos;m sure they&apos;ll be good."
