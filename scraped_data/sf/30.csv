5,"This burrito was SO good ah! As good as I remembered from a couple years ago. This time I got the burrito El Dorado style which made it much more enjoyable (less messy), although it was still a bit soggy towards the end.  The meat is full of flavor and good without any sauce. One interesting thing about the burritos is that they don&apos;t have rice but I&apos;m fine with that.

During covid the lines are more reasonable and they take card! Food came out quickly on a Sunday late afternoon."
5,"This is the spot for burrito lovers! La Taqueria has the best meat that I have ever tasted in a burrito and I am not exaggerating when I tell you that these burritos are juicy! The meat is so full of flavor and meat juices just seep into the entire burrito making it one of the best that I have had in California. Most San Franciscans I know prefer to go to El Farolito but honestly, they are just such different burritos that I don&apos;t think you can even compare the two. But just to summarize for you, the main differences are that this one is much juicier but smaller in comparison. Also, note that there is no rice in these burritos.

I came on a Wednesday for lunch and got the carnitas super burrito and my boyfriend got the carne asada burrito, both dorado style. Although the line and wait were long, it was worth it! I have had their tacos before but their burritos always looked so amazing. The burritos came out hot and the tortilla was not too thick which was perfect as we didn&apos;t really reach the &quot;food coma&quot; state after devouring our lunch. 

The carnitas was amazing and not oily or fatty, instead, it was pure flavor and meat juices. The guacamole was fresh and tasted like real avocado, unlike some other places that try to dilute the avocados with other flavors and add-ins. Also, I loved their pico de gallo because it looked freshly chopped and tasted great. The carne asada tasted like a good steak which is usually not the case in burritos because they tend to be overcooked, dry, and flavorless.  We really enjoyed both types of meat and can&apos;t wait to come back for more deliciously juicy and mouthwatering burritos. 

They do take credit cards now but there is a fee for using a card instead of cash. Parking is difficult but if you don&apos;t mind walking a few blocks then it&apos;s not too bad during the weekdays. Just be prepared to wait in line to order since there are usually both locals and tourists on-site waiting La Taqueria&apos;s delicious eats."
5,"I have to say, this is probably one of the best burrito places that I&apos;ve been to in the Bay Area so far. The restaurant itself is pretty small and the line is always super long every time I&apos;ve been here, but that&apos;s only a testament to the popularity of the place. During pre-covid times, it can get pretty hectic so make sure you get a seat or find a place to eat it outside. 

    For the burrito, remember to get it El-Dorado style since that is where they will toast the outside so that it&apos;s crispy when you&apos;re eating it. I usually get the carnitas burrito, which is always super flavorful and savory. The sauces and meat combined with the El-Dorado style crisp makes this such a great burrito, with only El Farolito being the other place that I&apos;ve seen do the El-Dorado style. It&apos;s a bit on the pricier side, but for the taste and the decent portion size it&apos;s definitely worth trying.

Overall, I would definitely recommend coming here if you want to check out great burritos in SF!"
1,"One of my most disappointing experiences at a taqueria in the Bay Area. 

Drove 45 minutes to try their burritos with my girlfriend on Valentines Day and was looking forward to it. Ordered two Carne Asada super burritos and made the mistake of not eating our food immediately only to find out once we got to our destination that we were given WRONG ORDERS, one bean and cheese burrito &amp; one carnitas burrito. The worst part is my girl doesn&apos;t eat pork and she took a bite of a NONLABELED PORK BURRITO. When we tried to go back to get our orders fixed it was 5 minutes after they closed and guess what, they &quot;Ran Out of Food!&quot;After spending $41 and TIPPING, I was very disappointed and if I could give them zero stars I would."
5,"I don&apos;t know WHY I was never told about this place!! So amazing! 

Must get-- tacos dorados de asada super with everything!!! Soooooo delicious!!! I will be back!"
4,"We had heard great things about la taqueria, so we decided to try it out. I got the carne asada regular burrito, (crisped?). The main thing about these burritos is that they don&apos;t have rice. The flavor of the meat, pico, beans, and tortilla were all great. My only qualms with it were that the burrito was super soggy and it was kind of salty (makes sense given there was no rice). Also, it was definitely pricier that i would have liked (one burrito was ~$10+). My friend who got tacos got two tacos for ~$16. Overall, it&apos;s a good burrito place, but given you&apos;re in the mission with so many great options...."
3,"The burritos here are solid! They are fat and they definitely don&apos;t skimp on the meat. I couldn&apos;t finish the burrito in 1 sitting and split it between 2 meals instead. Felt the burrito had a little too much rice, that&apos;s the only thing I would change about the food. 

However, service was a little slow, and we questioned why the people that ordered after us were able to get their food before us. They are also cash only, but if you don&apos;t have cash on you, you can get it from their ATM for of course, a little extra fee. Parking in the area is street parking, you might have to circle around a couple times if the area is busy."
3,"I think I got unlucky with my visit. Several people have recommended La Taqueria to me but unfortunately my order was switched up with someone else&apos;s - so instead of the carnita super burrito dorado style, I got a carne asada non dorado.

First the good - the carne asada was soft and juicy. I really liked the pico that comes in the super burrito. And I appreciate that there is no rice! So you can eat the whole burrito but not feel overly full or look forward to soggy burrito leftovers the next day.

The big con - besides getting the wrong meat filling - was the non dorado preparation! I was soo excited to try this. Instead of getting a toasty burrito, the one I got had an overly soft wrap and almost cold filling. It was so sad and felt like they took the tortilla straight out of the fridge and filled it with toppings from the counter, and not the grill. 

I will be back, because the quality was good. And because of expectation. I&apos;m sure I just got unlucky!

Covid: order at the entrance (plexiglass set up) or call ahead. If calling ahead, there&apos;s a separate pick-up window. Wait outside for your order number to be called out.
Food: 3/5
Value: 3/5
Quality/consistency: 3/5
Service: 3/5"
4,"I&apos;ve been wanting to try their burrito for the longest time and I&apos;m happy to say that it did meet my expectation. I got their regular carne asada burrito el dorado style (make sure you get this style so they grill the tortilla for you -- it adds that extra crunch and makes the burrito much more delish). My burrito was about $10 and it was HUGE. It took me a while to finish but it was so good that I ate the whole burrito in one sitting. 

La Taqueria&apos;s burrito doesn&apos;t have rice in it and instead it&apos;s filled with big and flavorful chunks of meat, salsa with tomato and onion, and beans. This was my first time having a burrito without rice and I personally liked this better because it didn&apos;t feel like I was eating too much carbs on top of the tortilla and I was able to enjoy the taste of meat better. The only downside is that maybe because it didn&apos;t have rice, the burrito was a bit salty. But other than that I thought the overall taste was pretty solid and worth the visit. 

P.S. you can call ahead of time and order to-go especially if you&apos;re visiting during the rush hours because there can be a long line! 

(also take credit cards now!)"
5,"Dear La Taqueria,

I&apos;m thinking about you right now. Oh man, this place is definitely a staples in SF.

One of the most highest quality taqueria I&apos;ve ever ate without having any bubble guts. High fresh quality ingredients and pack with protein. I don&apos;t know too much taqueria that gives you HELLA protein and no rice.

La Taqueria definitely wins."
5,"I love La Taqueria! I came here a couple of Saturdays ago for burritos. It was pretty busy. First, you order and then you wait to pick up your order. I would say it takes about 20 minutes.

My boyfriend got the carne asada and I got the carnitas super burrito. I enjoyed the El Dorado style burrito with no rice! Usually, I get super bloated from a burrito but I was almost able to finish this in one sitting! I didn&apos;t feel too bloated after too. I loved their salsa and everything that was wrapped inside. The meats were very juicy and tender. Maybe I&apos;ll start ordering burritos without rice now when I go to other burrito places! I can&apos;t wait to be back."
4,"Carnitas super burrito is where it&apos;s at. Hailed as one of the best places in California to get a Carnitas burrito we had to come here and check it out ourselves.

It was pretty good packes with crunchy and crispy carnitas that didn&apos;t disappoint. 

Be prepared for a line but it goes quickly and there&apos;s usually no seating."
3,"Went to the city for a little food adventure and this was on our list. Parking was difficult, well because it&apos;s San Francisco, but when we got to the place the line had already died down. 

We ordered carne asada hard and soft taco and super burrito. I was surprised with the how much the total was because most taco places I know are pretty cheap. With the $ alone, I was expecting the foods to be really good. 

The tacos were a bit of a mess because the fillings were outside of the actual tacos. It was still delicious though! I think it was the sauce tbh haha we both preferred the hard taco (was soft cause it got soggy, but there were still some crunch to it). I didn&apos;t enjoy the burrito as much but my bf liked it! The green sauce they gave us was pretty spicy. 

COVID: STAFF DID NOT WEAR GLOVES!! There was no outdoor seating, staff wore masks, sanitizer wasn&apos;t provided, and restrooms weren&apos;t available."
5,"Literally, what more can I say?

1. La Taq is home to one of my favorite burritos, ever.
2. I love that they don&apos;t add rice to their burritos because I&apos;d rather get full from eating beans, meat, cheese, salsa, and guac fillings.
3. Dorado style my whole life please. If you get your burrito dorado style, LT will fry your burrito in oil on their grill. This is the only way I want to eat burritos now. I&apos;m a texture girl so I love crunchy and crispy things. The added crisp and flaky elements takes the burrito to another level.
4. Ok tacos, I know they&apos;re on the pricier end of tacos, but they&apos;re super filling and worth it. The tacos are packed with meat and you get a crunchy taco shell and soft taco shell - all the textures. Get it super!
5. They also make a delicious cantaloupe agua fresca. It&apos;s especially refreshing during this heatwave we&apos;re experiencing."
5,"La Taqueria is hands down one of the best taquerias in the mission and in San Francisco. But, is their burrito the BEST? Read more below:

LA TAQ VS TAQUERIA EL FAROLITO BURRITO: 

I&apos;ve had farolito many times and la taq once. They&apos;re both 5/5. but I don&apos;t think one is better than the other. 

Farolito is your big loaded fantastic burrito with everything you want and lots of flavor, an amazing tortilla, and a perfect burrito fold. La taq is more lean. More meat, no rice. High quality ingredients with a lot of flavor also. La taq does the &quot;dorado style&quot; (pan frying) sooooo good (better than Farolito does) and has better sauce. 

I&apos;d say Farolito, for when you&apos;re really hungry and want big and flavorful burrito. La taq for when you want something more lean and clean. Both are super tasty and high quality. Price is similar, but el Farolito is a couple bucks cheaper. 

Other details about La Taq
- covid safe and clean
- great for takeout during covid
- efficient staff and team 
- good beer selection
- expensive. Like $13 for a super burrito compared to $9-$10 at other local taquerias 
- FANTASTIC SAUCE"
4,"Order was really quick, ready in 10 minutes! It felt like a VIP line to walk past all the people waiting, and pay for our phone order. Thank you for the contactless payment too! 
Burrito dorado style gives it a smokey taste. It&apos;s toasty but not crunchy style. I had regular crunchy and soft tacos. It was a good balance between the 2 different textures. Lots of steak, not fatty. If you like it spicy, request for some pickled jalapeños. I enjoyed the tacos even more! I gave it 4 stars because I didn&apos;t really taste the Mexican seasoning that makes it distinct from other places."
5,Love this place!!! JUICY TACOS and BURRITOS. Hands down happiness in your belly. ~~~~~~~~~~~
3,"I ordered the regular steak burrito &quot;Dorado style&quot;

I was in the area in the midst of covid, it was the perfect time for me to try the hype, no lines and short wait. Welp, I have to say it certainly didn&apos;t reach my level of expectations based on everyones hype in the reviews. Although, i did enjoy the steak which was seasoned very well, however this burrito is definitely not for me. For one i felt like it had a lack of texture as every bite was smushy and wet to the feel. 2nd I would prefer to have an option to add rice to give the texture some balance, neither the regular or the super comes with Rice. The salsa i enjoyed which had a nice touch of heat. 

Best part of all the price is fair and inexpensive. 

I&apos;ll try the tacos next time if i am in the area and update my review."
4,"Hi everyone. I came here today because they say it&apos;s a popular place to eat here. Well on my end the burrito was ok. From 1 thru 10, I  give it a 7. Everyone has different taste buds. I was expecting more. Yes, it&apos;s pricey and the size of the Super Burrito is not too big. The flavor of the meat itself isn&apos;t that bad. Go on, and try it for yourself. And see your taste buds."
5,"What more is there to write than what&apos;s already been written on Yelp and all the foodies in California? I was hankering for some mexican food after I picked up some ice cream (yeee Garden Creamery!). On the drive back down to San Mateo, I made a quick pull to the side of the road and jumped into the line which was only 3 deep. Perhaps it was the time (3p) or covid, but I was in and out within maybe... 15 minutes max. 

I got the regular carne asada burrito, didn&apos;t realize 1) they accept cards and 2) the regular burrito is not grilled! 

Regardless, the carne asada was cut up in big juicy chunks and the salsa verde was spicy but delicious. I scarfed down a bit more than half of the burrito and got outta there safely."
