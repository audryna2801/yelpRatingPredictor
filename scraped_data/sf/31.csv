5,"If I could give this place 10 stars, I would. Amazing food, service, cocktail &amp; wine menu, + more. My fiancé and I dined here for our Valentine&apos;s Day dinner on the 13th and loved every single second. They have a really nice outdoor seating area with plenty of heaters and covered tables if you want to dine in. 

We each tried a few drinks and loved them all: the lemon drop, cosmo &amp; whiskey sour were all winners. 

We had a bit of everything for the food, and every single thing was SO delicious. Homemade bread - winning. We both had the French onion soup (some of the best we&apos;ve ever had), the mesclun salad (absolutely delicious), filet mignon was cooked to perfection and was pretty big + we ordered the potatoes for the side, and creme brûlée. All were absolutely perfect and we loved EVERYTHING. 

And the service. Wow. They are so amazing. The owner was even out serving people and making small talk. Loved every moment and will 100% be back."
5,"So many things I love about this place, one of the only restaurants I&apos;m willing to trek back to the city for after moving to Oakland. My husband and I have been coming here for years. 

Classic French food served with insane hospitality.

1. Amazing elevated french classics, I don&apos;t think ever had anything that wasn&apos;t amazing here

2. Fantastic wine and cocktail list

3. Service in fantastic--- you will never be rushed and when Phillippe is in a jovial (couple of drinks mood) you can expect a some real entertainment (our whole wedding party was crying in a good way), Ellen is a boss and just holds the place down at all times. Everyone remembers you when you stop by, and its really lovely! 

Note: When COVID is not in swing expect to get a kiss planted on your cheek by Phillippe, along with many hugs.

4. When they have it the Fois Gras will change your life.  The Filet with Bone Marrow is amazing, oysters are always fresh, always excited with whatever the amuse bouche is, vegetables and salads are always creative and interesting and their desserts are legitimately out of this world. We tend to get the fixed menu because they always have innovative dishes.

They are doing outdoor dining with heat lamps, recommend you bring a blanket like we did. Lovely time and we will keep coming back no matter where we have moved to."
5,"Broke out of lockdown to dine outdoors at Chapeau! I used to live three blocks down and never tried it...what a dumb mistake. 

Everything about the experience was awesome. The super nice lady who was tending to us made awesome cocktails and gave us great suggestions. 

We did the three course...great deal where we got escargot, French onion soup + filet and scallops + french toast, profiteroles. All our dishes were fantastically balanced and delicious...I can&apos;t believe I hadn&apos;t come here more often. Im sure you could choose anything on the menu and it would be awesome."
4,"I reserved a table for celebrating my wedding anniversary. It was one of the few places offering sit down dining during Covid. 

My wife and I took 3 course meal each. Hers was all vegetarian with a Mesclun salad, pasta and Profiteroles. 

Our appetizers were delicious and raised our expectations for the next course of meals.
Trio of salmon is a must try for all fish lovers. 

Our entree was slightly disappointing and the reason for not a perfect 5 star review. 
The pasta was chewy and seemed undercooked and raw. Could not finish it and was not so savory either. 
The desserts again helped turn the experience on a positive note. I could keep coming to eat profiteroles here again and again. They were simply yumm! 

The overall experience was nice and private but the staff could me more attentive to each table."
4,Chapeau is a fancy French restaurant in a cozy quiet neighborhood on Clement. It&apos;s for locals and it&apos;s still for some tourists. I am staying nearby and may leave the area sometime. I decided to try Chapeau by having 6 oysters for $20. It&apos;s nice and well it&apos;s covid so the seating is outdoor.
2,"Ordered delivery, and was really underwhelmed. If it wasn&apos;t for the creme brulee this would have been one star. 

Ordered desserts for a birthday celebration and couldn&apos;t eat two of the five, really really gross. 

The blueberry tart tasted like plastic and the pudding thing was solid, like rubber. The two ice creams were full of ice and very watery. 

I don&apos;t know what to say, just really disappointing for a place that was so expensive. Big let down. Don&apos;t order desserts"
5,This place is delicious! I had the cassoulet and it was so good. The duck was tender and the beans were perfectly cooked. My husband had the filet mignon and loved it.
5,"Where do I start...? 

It&apos;s not only the ambiance, worked on by an amazing team that makes you feel at home and attended constantly... 

It&apos;s not only the food... which blew my mind, the onion soup, the salmon tartar and the cassoulete (casserolle)... WHAT...!?! This was unbelievable.... 

It&apos;s not only that... it&apos;s the amazing croissants and desserts ... and it&apos;s the chef&apos;s love and attention to everyone... 

This place was unbelievable... I cannot be more grateful to have spent thanksgiving dinner at such an amazing hidden gem."
5,"Good Food and Great Service

It was my birthday dinner so we wanted to try a new restaurant. We were able to make a reservation at Chapeau 2 days prior, perfect!

I ordered the 3 course meal with Smoked duck salad, fillet mignon and apple tart. Everything tastes good! 
The salad was probably my favorite dish. It was very flavorful with many different textures and flavors, the smoked duck was very good and the portion was very good! The fillet mignon was cooked more on the rare side but the sauce was good so I didn&apos;t mind it. However, the flavor profile was not offering much as I was expecting more elements in a main course. The apple tart was comforting and considering a big portion in French cuisine.

 I appreciate restaurants like this in San Francisco!
Everything tastes good and the service is welcoming. The whole experience is very pleasant, thank you!"
4,"I would give 5 stars if the dining area was better. For a French Restaurant I did expect nicer tables/settings than being sat in the middle of the sidewalk on old tables. So the atmosphere was unpleasant.

But Otherwise the service, price &amp; taste of food was all great!"
5,"Amazing food , great wines and fine service.  It was a cold night when my husband and I stumbled about this restaurant.  We had no reservation and it seemed very busy.  I approached the gentleman with a French accent and asked (in French) for a table for two . First he directed me to the lady in charge of the tables. He realized that the lady was busy, he told me that he would take care of us. And he did!  He accommodated us right away. We found out later that he was the executive chef.  Had it not been so cold , we would have ordered dessert and stayed longer.  

Highly recommend this restaurant and will certainly go back more often!"
4,"Came here for a birthday  dinner!

Service was great! From recommendations to describing the plates to serving and ending with a birthday song!

What an overwhelming list of red wines! I&apos;m not much of a wine drinker so having help choose the right wine was a highlight for me. 

Food was great  but don&apos;t come too hungry because the wait time in between is a little long. 

My filet was excellent this day. I would recommend it. The onion soup was superb. &amp;loved the escargot which was de-shelled for easier eating. 

Overall I had a wonderful experience and would love to come back!"
5,"Excellent place! Get the Filet Mignon. I can&apos;t wait for all the Covid BS to be over so I can enjoy this place again.
It&apos;s expensive, but it&apos;s a great spot for a special celebration."
5,"Came here for restaurant week but didn&apos;t order from the restaurant week menu. I ordered the escargot, french onion soup and baked Alaska. 

Escargot - This was what I was most excited to try after reading the reviews. The pesto sauce is perfect for the escargot. The dish tasted good but I wouldn&apos;t order it again as I can&apos;t get the mental images of snails out of my head as I was eating it. 

French onion soup - Loved this. This soup exceeded all my expectations. I love the cheese, soaked bread and flavor of the soup. It was a bit salty, but that was fine with me. My boyfriend ordered the french onion soup as well and he felt there was too much cheese and salt in his so he didn&apos;t finish his. 

Baked Alaska - For some reason I was a little bit disappointed with this dessert. It looks much bigger in the photos that are posted but it&apos;s the perfect size for one person. I think what disappointed me was the rum ice cream. Next time I&apos;ll try the french toast. 

5 stars for good food, great service, ambiance and overall dining experience. The host that directed me to the table was funny cracking up jokes. Even leaving the restaurant he was friendly with restaurant goers, having conversations outside and saying goodbye to everyone individually. You really get the sense that they value everyone&apos;s business."
5,"The meal my girlfriend and I shared here for Valentine&apos;s Day was nothing short of exquisite. Philippe prepared a spectacular 5-course meal, each component of which blew us away. The service was also fantastic.  We were seated outdoors in a wooden booth tastefully decorated with potted plants. There was a heat lamp to keep us warm during the evening, and all the staff were incredibly polite and welcoming. A truly spectacular evening we will not soon forget."
4,Came here for dinner one time. I had a three course meal and the presentation was amazing. The food quality is good as well. Im giving this 4 stars because the inside is very tight space and i feel like im so close to the table next to me.
5,"During the Covid 19 Pandemic in August 2020, we dined on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant.They are open Wed-Sunday 4-8pm for outside dining. It was 60 and breezy, so wear layers.
We were trying to support local restaurants, so they can survive. All will get a 4 star review for being open. Reservations are a must.

We&apos;ve been here many time, see our food blog for full review.

Service isn&apos;t like the old days, but this is the pandemic. Please survive!

 Picks:
mesclun salad ($14) creme dijonnaise . grape . roasted pistachio is great. Balanced dressing, good portion size.

5,"Chapeau has been on my list for a long time, and I finally got to dine here during SF Restaurant Week! I enjoyed every part of my meal! Two girlfriends and I ordered the $65 menu (the $40 menu didn&apos;t really appeal to us). Here&apos;s what we got!

- Escargot: a French classic, this was done perfectly! The garlicky buttery concoction that the escargot was in was delicious. We couldn&apos;t stop dipping the complimentary (warm!!) bread in it.
- Filet mignon: this came with hen of the woods mushrooms, potatoes, cauliflower, and two different sauces. Everything came together in a yummy medley! The filet mignon was perfectly cooked to medium rare, as requested!
- Creme brulee: I LOVE creme brulee, so even though I was stuffed by the end of the filet, I had to finish it! It had the perfect crackly sugar crust and deliciously creamy and sweet inside. 

Service was super attentive. They kept filling my water after I took a few sips! You feel like you&apos;re in France because all the waiters are even speaking French (lol.. we couldn&apos;t understand it haha). The owner is also really sweet and greets everyone!"
5,"Came here awhile ago for an early dinner with my daughters, and forgot to post my review. 
The food was delicious - escargot, French onion soup, mussels with white wine and garlic sauce with pomme frites, ratatouille, creme brûlée, mixed drinks, wine, and cafe au lait. My girls said &quot;the soup and creme brûlée were the bomb!&quot; Lol! 
The service was excellent and fun - our waiter/ bartender was charming and entertaining. He gave us lots of attention and joked with us. He even wrapped our leftovers in cute aluminum wrapped shaped swan and basket. We had such a great time that I asked if I can take pictures of him with the girls. He happily agreed and grabbed a few hats (chapeaus) for the three of them to pose with. They looked adorable. The owner/chef came out shortly to greet the patrons and took pictures with us, too. Both gave us warm goodbyes. It felt homey like dinner with old friends."
5,"A few weeks before our anniversary I turned to yelp... as usual to find a great place for my husband and I to celebrate our special day at! I searched Michelin star rated restaurants and chapeau popped up...with almost 3k reviews and 4.5 stars WOW

It was so nice to find a fancy restaurant that I open on a Sunday! 

Parking could be tricky, but manageable! The staff is beyond believe nice... beginning with the hostess. She showed us a couple of tables avail

The place is small and cozy! 

We sat down and were greeted promptly by Ellen! She took our drink order. 
 Next the owner/chef came by to wish us a happy Anni. Such a nice touch

I placed an order for oysters. They came out pretty quickly along with the bread. The oysters have a delicious spicy vinegar sauce. Wonderful start

Ellen explained the entire menu! We decided to go with the four course! 

I had the trio of salmon! I think it&apos;s one of the most popular items on the menu. Absolutely delicious. 

My husband enjoyed the French onion soup. Growing up with a mom raised in France... it&apos;s safe to say the soup was by far one of the best most authentic I have had yet

Next course was a seared scallop with bacon foam and avocado purée. UNREAL. The mix of flavors were a true delight. 

I had ordered the pork and my husband the steak! 

Hen of the woods were on both of our plates. It&apos;s so hard to find places that cook with that type of mushroom. Such a treat to enjoy. 

The steak was so tender you could cut it with a fork. It was surrounded by the mushrooms and perfect potatoes that looked like scallops. The plate had delicious pepper corn sauce/glaze

My tenderloin had a pepper mustard sauce that was so creamy yet sharp tasting. Topped with endive. The flavors just burst. Also so tender and easy to slice paper thin while you savor each bite. 

For once I wanted cheese instead of sweets (I regretted) I was soooo full and had to pack it to go lol

My husband enjoyed the Brûlée! That is another item I can honestly say that was the best I&apos;ve had. Especially not being a fan of the item I ate half of it lol 

This place is beyond recommended. The price point makes it easy to come back over and over 

When we left the owner hugged us bye and Ellen walked us out. You truly feel like part of the family. 

We will be back! They made our anniversary so special ."
