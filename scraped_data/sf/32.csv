5,Outdoor seatings were available and I was SUPER lucky to only wait for 10 mins for a Sunday brunch!!! I added berries to my pancakes and they gave me SO much! Unlike other restaurants where they give you 5-6 berries for extra dollar.
5,"Quick take: COVID-19 dining. Great service and breakfast.

We were across the street buying focaccia bread. Quickly noticed there wasn&apos;t a line at Mama&apos;s. A few tables are setup in the sidewalk. Also saw some tables setup in the street on Filbert. The weather was perfect for a sidewalk breakfast.

The service here is excellent; very attentive and sweet waitresses. Great social distancing practices by all staff members. We ordered and paid at the cashier&apos;s window. Picked our own table and had a great breakfast.

We ordered the Two farm fresh eggs w/ham and Huevos Rancheros. Both dishes were delicious. The eggs are especially good. The Spanish rice was nice and moist not dry. Very fresh and tasty ingredients.

It was nice eating here without having to wait in line."
5,"So y&apos;all know why it&apos;s called MAMA&apos;s right? Cause it tastes so good, make you wanna slap yo mama. Nah, but for real though it does taste hella good. Everyone from the city got that one restaurant you&apos;ve always wanted to try, but not tryna wait 2 hours long. Guess what?! I went during prime time in October of this year and no wait!!! 

Outdoor Parklet: Beautiful, would make any plant parent proud. 
Safety: Everybody had on masks with sanitizer available. 

The homie Slam instructed me to get the Monte Cristo Sandwich. I&apos;m like nah hold up, I&apos;m not trying to get a sandwich at a brunch spot, especially at MAMA&apos;s, I&apos;m tryna taste their BEST dish. We not here to play around. He stressed and insisted I need to try it, it&apos;s &quot;HELLAAA GOOD&quot;. Alright alright, with hesitancy I ordered it. 

One bite and &quot;DAMM THIS SANDWICH HELLAAA GOOD&quot;!!! Fell in love at first bite... and first sight. Roasted turkey breast, honey baked ham, cheddar, and gruyere cheese sandwiched between two French toast buns. Their home jam?!?!! Did I mention their home jam!?!?! 

I opted for the potato salad side and it made me feel like it was Thanksgiving. My goodness! Not even gonna lie, I&apos;m a believer now and I will wait two hours, maybe, for you MAMA&apos;s."
5,"This is one of my go to brunch places in San Francisco. All their dishes are so good! 

Typically their weekend lines are long but this time we visited on a Friday. The line was about 10 minutes. A big plus right now - they do have heaters. It truly helps in the winter time in the city. 

I could literally recommend any dish. My favorite are the pancakes and French toast. Oh and don&apos;t forget to order one of their desserts. They are freshly baked and delicious. This time around we got the carrot cake. The cream cheese was to die for. 

Get their early to ensure you get a seat and don&apos;t have to wait very long."
3,"Summary: (During Covid-19 outdoor dining) 3/5 stars for San Francisco brunch. 4/5 for California overall. You can get your money&apos;s worth elsewhere in SF and with a slightly higher quality. Cute brunch spot with a solid brunch in Little Italy/Chinatown. 

Price: $$ Slightly above average brunch prices for San Francisco. $29 for the dungeness crab eggs benedict. $17.50 for the french toast sampler. $9 alcoholic refreshers (decent price).

Food:
Pros - fresh dungeness crab. Copious strawberries and bananas on the french toast sampler. Fresh smoothie. Very good presentation.
Cons - I prefer my muffins for my eggs benedict to be toasted a little bit crispier so it wouldn&apos;t get too soggy when my yolk gets cut. Potatoes were ok, but there&apos;s a lot of room for improvement. Other brunch spots have crispier and more seasoned potatoes. French toasts tasted fine, but not as crispy as the usual French toast. These do seem to be homemade, but I think they weren&apos;t on the skillet long enough.

Service: As this was during covid, we ordered at the counter and had the food delivered to us."
4,"Another place where it took a pandemic to allow me to try it.  Mama&apos;s....infamous and known for the long waits for a delicious breakfast that you could only dream of what it tastes like.  Well folks, I finally tried it.  Even though it was take out, it was still pretty dam good.  That Monte Cristo is exactly what everyone&apos;s been raving about.  Its extra good, crispy and taste even better with the jam.  USE THE JAM AND JAM IT INTO THE SAMMY.

The salmon eggs benny was good too but not the best thing to eat to-go in your car.  But that egg was pretty dam perfect and the bernaiaisie sauce was uber good."
3,"The location is good because it&apos;s right next to a park. You can pick up food, just sit on a bench at the park, and enjoy the views/weather.

The menu didn&apos;t have much variety. There wasn&apos;t much vegetarian options either. We ordered two omelettes (Northwest &amp; Californian) and a hot chocolate. It was ready within 15 minutes! The Californian was alright, the bacon was crispy and I love crispy bacon! There was a little too much cheese for me. Honestly, there was nothing special about the omelette. For $18, the portion was small and not really worth it. But meh San Francisco prices lol"
3,My friends and I ordered from here for a brunch at home. I was so excited to try this spot after all the amazing reviews! However it did not live up to my expectations. I ordered the vegetarian eggs Benedict and was super disappointed to see a soft boiled egg instead of the runny eggs Benedict we all know and love. It was still a tasty dish but would not pay for this again. I also had the banana pancakes but they were burnt on the bottom and didn&apos;t even have banana in the pancake mix. This place has the perfect brunch staples but unfortunately my experience with the food was not the best:(
5,"OK. Worth the wait, I am here for the hype. The line was ridiculously long but we were optimistic about having time before our next activity. We were wrong, so wrong! After waiting 60 minutes we were still not seated &amp; had to make the tough decision to leave empty handed and hungry. WE CAME BACK THE NEXT DAY AND IT WAS A HOME RUN! I would LOVE to come back. 

Local drip coffee shop around the block - grab some coffee while you wait in line."
5,Reviews were what drew my attention to this place. We arrived and waited in the long line ( which you knew was good if there was a line) staff was super friendly. Service was really quick. And food... WAS AMAZING!! Well worth the wait! For sure! The food was so tasty. The homemade jam was to die for!
4,"As a San Francisco native, I&apos;ve been a huge fan of Mama&apos;s for years!! I always come back for the mouth watering buttery pancakes.

When I came here as a teenager, the line usually extends 2 blocks, but I was surprised to be the 2nd customer in line at 9am (they open at 9 now, it used to be 8). They have limited indoor dining tables, and patio parklets for outdoor dining. You would order and pay at the cafe entrance and be seated with your order number, similar to pre-Covid. 

I ordered the crab cake Benedict, chocolate cinnamon French toast, and the buttermilk pancakes. For some reason, the pancakes weren&apos;t as soft and buttery as I remembered. They were actually a little burnt. I wonder if it was because I was one of the first customers of the day, and the first pancake always gets burnt as a cooking rule?? Anyway, that was a slight disappointment for me, but the French toast and the Benedict was divine.

The customer service is excellent. Our server was very attentive, and checked in on us often. Make sure you try the homemade jam!!"
3,"I haven&apos;t been here in a while, and looks like a lot has changed during the pandemic. Still attracts big crowds and long lines, however though, so expect a short wait :) Once you get here, you want to stand in line first, then place and pay for your order at the front window, where you&apos;ll then be given a number. Then just choose your seat whenever one becomes available. 
The wait staff and busser were very kind, and the food tasted delicious as I remembered. But, one thing I did find disturbing was the short piece of thick curly hair found in my crab eggs Benedict. At first, I thought maybe it was just my hair or something that had fallen onto my food, but then when I tried to pull it out, it was massively stuck inside the meat! Not to alarm any other diners around me, I got the attention of the nearest waitress and let her know discreetly. She didn&apos;t seem bothered by it, and just said that she would have the kitchen prepare me another plate. I understand that mistakes happen, but I think that during a time like Covid, proper hygiene and food preparation should be of utmost importance. I wish I hadn&apos;t felt so grossed out after dining here, because it would have otherwise been an outstanding experience."
4,"Pre pandemic we would wait an hour to get seated here! Our go-tos would be the Smoked Salmon Benedict or the Monte Cristo. 
We arrived at 2pm on a Sunday and were seating within 5 minutes outside in one of their carports. It was great for our party of 5 and two dogs! We ordered some eggs Benedict&apos;s, and a French Toast combo. They ran out of hollandaise sauce but the egg yolks were runny enough that it acted as they sauce.  Maybe we just got the lasts of everything after a big rush but the home potatoes were still kinda raw and the French toast had a very eggy layer. The food wasn&apos;t as great as we recall pre-covid but it still hit the spot and we felt safe outdoor dining!"
5,"We had a really nice breakfast here, I had a California omelette and my gf had the banana French toast! Everything was amazing! Best part was probly the jelly they had for the toast!"

What a great brunch spot.  Came during COVID in Dec 2020 on a Saturday.  Most of the tables were occupied, which of course means there was no line at all.  Cristo was excellent.  Crab benedict was very good.  Pancakes were great.  I would totally come back, though I fear the return of the lines post COVID..."
4,"A cute breakfast &amp; lunch spot with great food and some of the friendliest staff I&apos;ve ever met!

This was my first time here and I&apos;ve heard there&apos;s always a long wait, but I came during shelter in place on a weekday and was seated outdoors with little to no wait. 

Our two waitresses were so sweet and accommodating and one of them was super funny and cracking jokes with all the customers. The whole place definitely has a very welcoming feel to it, so I could see a lot of people being regulars here.

We had the famous Monte Cristo sandwich and the Slim Joe&apos;s burger, both of which were great. I&apos;ve never had a Monte Cristo before but I think I&apos;ll have to start having them more! The battered bread had such a great fluffy texture and the cheese and meat was nice and melty. I thought the burger was a little basic since there&apos;s not really any sauce, but the onions and the cheese were definitely really flavorful and the baguette was a nice touch, so overall it was still very delicious. (It&apos;s served with ketchup and hot sauce too). As for the potatoes, they weren&apos;t as crispy as I normally like potatoes, but they were still pretty tasty. 

I have to say though the star of the entire meal was the homemade jam. I swear it was some of the best jam I&apos;ve ever had! (although it&apos;s true I haven&apos;t had a lot of homemade jam before.) It paired really nicely with the Monte Cristo, but I honestly could&apos;ve eaten it by itself with a spoon.

I wasn&apos;t really in the mood for a sweet entree this time around which is why we stuck with sandwiches, but I kind of regretted it once I saw the french toast and pancake plates arriving at the tables around me. I absolutely want to come back and get the french toast sampler next time!"
5,"Mama&apos;s was highly recommended to us last year and loved it. Came back this year and our routine is: to catch the 1st flight out of LA, catch the BART into the City, check into our hotel and straight to Mama&apos;s. My personal FAVORITE meal is the Florentine: Baby Spinach and Sautéed mushrooms with potatoes. The same lady that served us last year, served us again this yesterday and welcomed us with open arms. See you again in June."
5,"This place is nearby where we live and love coming here.  The waitresses were really nice to my newborn and came over and gave us extra banana for him.   They also recommended a great french toast sampler plate which had Kugelhupf, Swedish Cinnamon, and Banana Walnut Bread with fruits, whipped cream and butter.    We also had the two regular poached eggs, large sausage links, and potatoes.   The prices are decent and the nice socially distant setting in the morning in North Beach is definitely relaxing.    We also had some coffee, and the waitresses came often for refill and orange juice.   I would say the orange juice was a little sour (which I don&apos;t mind) but it was fresh.  The berry sauce was amazing with the sourdough I had from my 2 eggs any way dish."
2,"Pretty disappointed.... recipes changed, for instance the potato salad is GROSS woth a TONNNNN Of mayo not really any Ingredients besides potatoes and mayonnaise. The breakfast potatoes were way over cooked and mushy and didn&apos;t taste very good. And grilled onions on my slim Joe really aren&apos;t grilled at all they&apos;re basically cooked but there&apos;s zero caramelization to them so that kind of defeats the purpose... wanted slim joe to be cooked medium rare this is totally well done so this is going in the trash most likely. Don&apos;t like to eat beef jerky burgers ....Honestly I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m gonna order from them again very disappointed. C&apos;mon Sanchez Family you guys better have somebody checking food quality before it goes out for delivery or takeout!"
5,"Mamas serves delicious brunch food and has plenty of outdoor sidewalk seating that&apos;s safe for these COVID times! Even though there was a bit of a wait when we got there, we managed to order our food and seat ourselves within 30 minutes. 

I wouldn&apos;t say the food is anything so special as to write home about, but it is good and it is brunch food that&apos;s plated beautifully. I got their French toast sampler, and my friend got the classic eggs Benedict, and we were both happy with our choices. Would recommend trying out their smoothie as well! Overall a great place with cute surroundings for brunch."
