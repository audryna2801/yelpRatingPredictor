5,"I&apos;ve ordered at least 3 times now for delivery and have been extremely pleased. I kept it simple and ordered the glazed; there are other options like raised, cake, and  buttermilk. They get it out the door relatively quick! 

Quality and service, thank you Bob&apos;s Donuts &amp; Pastry Shop!"
5,"This place is obviously amazing. There&apos;s always a line outside, pre-pandemic and during pandemic. My mom used to go to this donut shop when she was little. She&apos;s always been a huge fan of Bob&apos;s donuts and was so excited to be eating it again as an adult. We got a little carried away and got a lot of donuts... 

We tried the: S&apos;mores donut (I didn&apos;t like it - was lacking a lot), coconut chocolate donut (I also didn&apos;t like it - wasn&apos;t good), regular glazed donut (delicious!!), donut holes (good but not the best), crumb cake (good!), apple fritter (delicious!!), and something else that I forget. 

If I were to order again, I&apos;d just get the apple fritter, crumb cake, and regular glazed donut. 

Everyone here was so nice and friendly. Donuts were fresh and we were happy!"
5,"Are you kidding me. Bob&apos;s Donuts is a reason to live. Two sugar, one glazed, If they don&apos;t have that, the lady will talk you into something else. 

Kind of close quarters for Covid, so I haven&apos;t been since March 13th, but probably the first or second best donuts I&apos;ve ever had in my rapidly diminishing existence."
5,"Bob&apos;a Donuts &amp; Pastry is a classic go-to! 

I&apos;ve been to Bob&apos;s a few times throughout the years at different hours -- morning, afternoon, late night. Always delicious! 

I&apos;ve tried a range of flavors and types of donuts. The famous crumb, traditional yeast, cake, old-fashioned, buttermilk, fritters, the giant donut. All tasty! I love their old fashioned matcha donut and their traditional glazed raised yeast the best, but there really is a donut for whatever mood you&apos;re in. 

I even accidentally ordered a chocolate pastry instead of a chocolate cronut, was ready to be disappointed, and found that even THAT was good. 

The only complaint I might have is that the lines can get long but even the lines move fairly quickly, all things considered. 

Bob&apos;a Donuts &amp; Pastry is worth it, every time!"
4,"Open 24/7 to satisfy your sweet tooth any time and any day!

I haven&apos;t visited this place in-person, but I did get a donut delivery here.

I had high expectation after seeing the reviews on Yelp. Unfortunately though, I was a little disappointed. The chocolate glazed donuts and morning buns were good except they were oily on the bottom. If you don&apos;t mind that oiliness, it&apos;s worth checking this place out!"
5,"The best old fashioned donuts at the best old fashioned donut shop at a place that still has old fashioned prices. The giant frosted donuts appear to be the stuff of fantasies, but my favorite thing there is either a plain old fashioned (sounds boring/is absolute perfection) OR to point at whatever is still hot. Whatever is hot and fresh has NEVER disappointed me, nor has it ever lasted long enough to capture a photo. The line moves fast but functions as a somewhat useful deterrent for me stopping every time I pass by."
5,"I finally had the opportunity to try their donuts here for my husbands birthday. The inside of this shop it&apos;s extremely small and bit run down. So don&apos;t expect anything great and grand! 

I came here solely to enjoy some delicious donuts! I ordered a bunch of donuts even though I orginally came for 4 donuts since my husband and I decided enough to finish. I got carried away and ended up with a big box of donuts. I don&apos;t quite remember the names of ie donuts but I enjoyed all of them. The lemon flavored donut was seriously so good. I finished the donut holes within 10 minutes... it is one of my guilty pleasures. 

Tasty, delicious, and fresh donuts!!!"
4,"FRESH DONUTS.

It&apos;s a popular shop and they are pumping out donuts daily maybe multiple times a day. I&apos;ve tried all their donuts and love their plain-glazed and apple fritter. Their apple fritter stands out compared to all the donuts. Skip the other stuff (non-donut stuff) .  I didn&apos;t find the donuts unique in taste compared to other donut shops in the bay area but still found the old school diner vibes and fresh donuts appealing. I love that they are open longer hours than any bakery or donut shop which ss important because I&apos;ve got weird cravings throughout the day and at 1 am (no not pregnant).


1. Apple Fritter 
2. Open all the time 
(check the hours because of covid) perfect when you are not sober and are craving sweets in the night
3. Giant-sized donuts
( sometimes inconsistent) - one time i got it for a birthday and it tasted bready and overproofed :(
4. If you aren&apos;t into this seedy location, they have another location on Baker street."
5,"Going into work early M-F in San Francisco. Can be a drag at times....but the are few places that are a pick me up when I can get to it. Bob&apos;s Donut and Pastry shop is definitely one of those places! My carpool driver has been bragging about this place for months on end...so I had to see what the commotion was all about. All I have to say is... .Chocolate glazed buttermilk cake donut!!!!!!!!!!

Of course no one needs all this sugar in there lives but hey...for now Im in sugar heaven."
4,"Co worker brought some of these bad boys in because she said this was her fav donuts to eat. These are not my fav, but I can see the hype. This donut is a lot more doughy than I am used to. I love fluffy light donuts. It&apos;s what I grew up with and what I love. My coworker got an assortment of 12, cronuts, glazed, chocolate, sprinkles, matcha?!, and some assorted cake donuts. I love cake donuts but these guys wow, they are overly sweet and thickkkk. Not too shabby, but I sure needed that glass of water/milk to wash that bad boy down."
4,"If you&apos;ve never been to Bob&apos;s, you definitely need to make it a stop. This donut shop is open 24/7 so if you ever have donut cravings, this is the place to be. They all sorts of donuts and even limited amounts of croissants. But they&apos;re known for their huuuge donuts as well as their cake donuts. 

I love how their donuts are soft and fluffy and has just the perfect amount of glaze. My favorites are the cake donuts, donut holes, glazed old fashions, and Apple fritters. 

There&apos;s often a line in the morning but it does by really fast."
3,"I&apos;ll take taste over presentation any day, which is good for Bob&apos;s since some of their donuts look a little like a 3rd grade art project. 

- Apple fritter:  This is a big guy!  Filled with chunks of apple, it had a soft, chewy center and a nice crisp outside.  Either go halfsies with someone or eat half and save the rest for later.   It&apos;s rich and heavy.  3.75/5
- Crumb Cake donut: &quot;Voted best crumb donut by some guy who likes donuts&quot;.  Not sure why this donut is significantly smaller than the others, but it made up for it in flavor. The &quot;guy who likes donuts&quot; was right.  Best crumb donut I&apos;ve ever had, although I must admit, I don&apos;t usually order crumb donuts.  4/5
- Crumb Raised:  Again, enjoyed the crumb, the donut itself wasn&apos;t the lightest/fluffiest I&apos;ve ever had (that award would go to Stan&apos;s in Santa Clara), but it wasn&apos;t bad.  3.5/5
- Matcha Old Fashion: Subtle on the matcha, which is fine by me since I&apos;m not a fan when it&apos;s super bitter. 3/5

A solid choice, but I wouldn&apos;t go out of my way.  3.5 stars."
5,"So fluffy and light and super delicious! I cannot wait to come back and get more! We got a horchata, a s&apos;mores, a croissant chocolate donut and a crumb. Oh and Apple fritter which was huuge!!"
5,"Went on a Sunday mid morning. There was a small line, but it moved pretty quickly. We were excited to try the crumb donuts and the original glazed. Ended up getting both of those as well as a Matcha glazed with Oreo crumble. Overall the donuts were really great, but I&apos;m sure they&apos;re much better if you can get them fresh.

The crumb was really moist and soft, and I would definitely get it again."
5,"The doughnuts here are softer than my kittens belly!

- Self proclaimed non doughnut person"
4,"One of the staple family owned donut shops in the SF area. A great way to support local business and perhaps bring a dozen (or two) to share in the office!
I&apos;m not a huge donut fan, but these are quite delicious even after sitting at room temperature for an entire day. The texture of donuts are a bit more crumbly or fluffy (depending on type) and less dense, which I prefer. They also are not overbearingly sweet. 
Cinnamon Cake: Nice fluffy texture, but wished the cinnamon flavor was taken up a notch. 
Apple Fritter: great apple flavors and probably one of their most popular items. 
It can get pretty busy so would recommend ordering ahead of time or going early to make sure you get the selections you want."
5,"Show your dietary restrictions the door, then come here and get wild.

Now that we have that squared away...

It&apos;s not every day that one bite of something compels you to go back and buy the entire shelf, but golly gee Bob those apple fritters are dangerous! 

These babies had a dark and crispy exterior, soft yeasty interior, with a thin glaze on the outside and lovely cinnamon apple studs throughout. Just beautiful. Everything that an apple fritter should be. 

Still thinking about a time when I can sneak back for my next fix :)"
4,"OLD school donut shop. 
BIG bang for your buck.
Open all day and night for your indulgence.
Nothing over the top or too trendy just a place that makes it the way that it has always been made.
ENJOY!"
4,"Don&apos;t be discouraged by the area! They have pretty good donuts here. It&apos;s a hole in the wall type place with donuts baked in-house. We found this place while we were handling some car business at the nearby Nissan Dealership. One of the guys there recommended this place to grab a snack. 

The cashier was so nice and even gave my son a free donut hole. It was super cute ^_^"
5,"Sooo good! Open all night can&apos;t beat it! Donuts are amazing, there may be a bum outside looking to converse but hey it&apos;s still worth it lol"
