5,"I&apos;ve dined in here pre-covid and have ordered a few times this year during quarantine - and while much of the world is in a different place, both the service and the quality of the food have stayed consistent at Shizen! Street parking only available.

2020 Quarantine: 
They only take phone orders, but are very good at estimating the time for pick up. There may be a line outside, but rest assured, they are super organized and prompt!

I&apos;ve taken a lot of friends here, from vegan to herbivore, and everyone in between- they have all loved it!

I recommend getting their specialty rolls, maki rolls and their noodle soups!"
5,"I grew up eating sushi in Japan and was so sad that I couldn&apos;t eat it w my vegetarian bf... enter Shizen. Who knew vegan sushi could be so good? 

Food: rich flavors (evenly distributed and cohesive), great texture (crispy items stayed crispy and nothing was dry), and beautiful presentation-- especially considering takeout/drive. The way they cook the food enhances the natural flavors of each ingredient to create an elevated final product. MAKE SURE TO TRY THE NIGIRI; this is where they really shine.

Price: expect to spend at least $20/person for a full meal. It&apos;s on the pricey side (as expected for sushi), so definitely recommend ordering as a group to try lots of things.
2 nigiri + 3 regular rolls + 3 specialty rolls = $106.58. Enough to feed ~5 people.

Novelty: The idea of vegan sushi was totally new to me. Also loved the idea of the &quot;suspense&quot; element (literally listed as an ingredient on the menu) of Surprise Ending. It&apos;s basically a roulette where one of the six rolls contains a surprise!

Menu: much variety, from apps to ramen to sushi options.

Overall, was impressed by the creativity! This was my second time and I&apos;m definitely looking forward to trying it again (:"
5,"I&apos;m trying to eat more plant based foods so when this sushi restaurant came up on my search for vegan food I was really intrigued to try it out. 

Spicy Tofuna Roll - basic and good but not spicy at all

Boddy &amp; Soul- tastes way better than it looks, since take out ruins the chef&apos;s presentation. This was my favorite roll out of the 3 we ordered. 

Open Invitation Roll - delicious, didn&apos;t know fried lotus root could taste so good!

The only con I can think of is that the location is pretty &quot;far&quot; from me so it would take a while to here. I would definitely come back and try out other roles if I&apos;m in the mission."
5,"This place is fire!!! It&apos;s bougie for sure. But defiantly worth it!! I love how delicious their rolls are and how I feel after I eat them. All of their rolls are good. But my favorite rolls are: number 1 &quot;Body and Soul&quot; roll second &quot;sweet potato&quot; roll and the &quot;spicy tuna roll&quot; these are my go to sushi rolls. They do get busy! So it might take an hour for your sushi to be ready. And recently it&apos;s taken about 30 mins but it depends on the day and time. Definitely be aware of that. 

I personally do not mind waiting but you should definitely call and place your order just in case it is a hour wait. So you don&apos;t end up waiting outside or in your car for that long. 

Parking is okay you have to find street parking. It is a little difficult Because it&apos;s on a one way street and usually all spots are occupied. Usually I find a spot but it can be overwhelming."
1,"We ordered three rolls, the Spicy Black Garlic Ramen and Gyoza. The one that stood out the most was the Body and Soul roll. Which was great-I just wish the other two were just as good. I&apos;m upset because this place is highly praised by many of my vegan friends and it did not live up to my expectations. We were so excited we ate in the car and was just so disappointed in the flavor and foo.d temperature. The ramen and gyoza were COLD. And even if it was cold I could of taken them home and warmed them up but the ramen had NO flavor at all. All we tasted was chili paste, no black garlic, onion salt or anything. I&apos;ve had instant ramen better than this. Wish I had the same experience as all the other yelpers on here. Shame

Note: We waited 45 mins for expensive cold flavorless food. Wtf? Waste of time and money."
4,"Just got some fantastic takeout!! Here&apos;s a comprehensive review:

Pros:
- Super carefully thought out menu, with some highly creative dishes to make everything plant based. 
- Delicious variety of flavors and textures; great for a change of pace when you&apos;re looking for new experiences for your sense of taste. 
- The takeout service was quick and the people very attentive and thoughtful. Quick to give good suggestions. 

Cons:
- A bit pricey; $120 for a medium-sized dinner for our family of four. No leftovers. 
- The ramen was strange. The bean curd was formed into a chashu-like shape that had a super strong taste that infused the whole dish with its pungency. 

The food (marked with * if we would get again):
- Gyoza: delicious. We ate them within seconds and wished for more. They&apos;re filled with delicate bits of vegetable and tofu. *
- Tempura: cut into cool forms, soft on the inside, perfectly crispy on the outside. Good, but nothing mind-boggling. 
- Yakisoba: SO tasty. I love dishes with tons of toppings and goodies thrown in and this fit the bill; my favorite was the bean curd, cut into slabs and tasting like the seitan tidbits (braised gluten) I would eat as a kid. *
- Ramen: already spoken on. Odd taste and the broth itself (besides being infused with the chashu) was not very flavorful. I would rather eat these same noodles in Yakisoba form (above). 
- Candlestick roll: spicy, avocado-y (yum) and a wide variety of textures. 
- Prime Suspect: tempura asparagus inside, eggplant on top. Good, but not WOW. 
- Hidden Agenda: really good. slightly sweet and crispy and delicious. *
- Plot Twist: YES!!! I absolutely love sweet and savory, so if you don&apos;t this isn&apos;t for you. But it&apos;s got the most amazing combination of tart mango, the bite of raw onion, and the acidity of tomato... balanced atop a roll filled with crunchy tempura sweet potato and soft bean curd. My favorite thing in the menu for sure. Wow. Literally a party in your mouth. I was astounded!!!!******"
5,Best vegan sushi I&apos;ve ever had! Genuinely comparable to the real deal they nail the texture and flavor. Had it last week and already have been craving it the past few days. Wish I was closer or else I&apos;d be eating it daily.
5,"Tbh, I was a bit skeptical of a vegan sushi restaurant but after trying out their rolls, they are actually SO GOOD. You can really tell the chefs experimented a lot through trial and error in order to get the taste just right. 

Part of eating here is priming your expectation that this is NOT fish, tobiko, etc., this is all vegan inspired. For it being vegan, this is delicious.

Ordered: 
Proud peacock
Hidden agenda
Body and soul
Open invitation 

Each were very tasty in their unique way. My favorite was hidden agenda and open invitation."
5,"The ramen and sushi were impeccable!! I would recommend microwaving the ramen soup before pouring it over the noodles; we ended up microwaving the whole thing with the noodles and soup because it wasn&apos;t hot enough and the noodles sucked up all the soup. But damn this was so delicious. I will definitely be back whenever I&apos;m in the area again!!! Love their imitation meat and mushrooms/bamboo shoot veggies in the ramen. Also the Soy cream tasted like real dairy, so rich and just a terrific addition to the sushi!"
5,"I can&apos;t believe it took me so long to try Shizen, given that I live only a block away. I guess the blessing of shelter-in-place has been the ability to order takeout from here -- I&apos;ve heard the wait time here is normally crazy for a table. 

As a non-vegan / non-vegetarian sushi lover, I was a little skeptical as to how good this could be, but I was absolutely blown away by the creativity and bold flavors!!! They know what they&apos;re doing here. 

Wait is ~1 hour to pickup, so call early! You can&apos;t go wrong with any of the rolls or nigiri. Cant wait to try the other items on the menu and hopefully be able to eat here when things open again!"
5,"Ordered food for pickup and absolutely loved the sushi here ! There aren&apos;t a ton of places that offer Vegan Sushi in the Bay Area so this place is a welcome relief for vegetarians :-) 

Pickup experience was as smooth as it could be . I&apos;d personally recommend hidden agenda  and the secret weapon as my personal favorites"
5,"Picked up food as togo order for gyoza, avacado roll, and hidden agenda and boddy and soul. Loved the sushi. I tried sushi first time and to be honest it was above expectation. will definitely go next time. I lived that they have so many vegetarian options."
4,"Couldn&apos;t find in due to CoVID but was well worth the 40 mile drive to pick up Sushi. We&apos;ve tried to dine in the past but the long wait times always lost over hunger!

This time around we ordered few different sushi and they were pretty good. Surprise ending, California roll, avocado roll and some more. All turned out to be good. They also have soups, salads and dumplings to offer.

The only reason for giving 4 star was because we couldn&apos;t have dine-in experience and try more dishes."
5,"SHIZEN IS AMAZING. Definitely best place to get vegan sushi and eats. I got: Open invitation, Proud Peacock, Shizen Kaarage, Shizen shiitake, Secret weapon, all amazing, Secret Weapon roll was very spicy so beware. Proud Peacock is a MUST TRY. In previous visits I&apos;ve had their ramen which is also great!"
4,"** The following review reflects my takeout experience DURING the shelter-in-place order currently in effect. **

Back in our carefree pre-pandemic days of yore, I remember walking by this spot on 14th where there would be a crowd of young, skinny people waiting on the sidewalk for a table. I was thinking that I would probably exceed the weight maximum in order to dine here credibly, so I didn&apos;t think about patronizing it. Now that most of us share a common bond of wearing masks and eating takeout and delivery, I passed by and thought to myself it was time to try it.

I decided to phone in my order and come back. First thing I asked was whether they had any no-rice roll options like a kyuri roll. She stepped away to ask and came back to tell me they don&apos;t. OK then. I just figured a vegan sushi place might have one on the menu. Moving on, I decided to order two rolls. The first was the $15 Proud Peacock, which featured cucumber, avocado, shiitake, seaweed pearls (whatever those are), and tofu, and acting in lieu of sashimi were eggplant, pickled mango, and roasted peppers (photo: https://bit.ly/32eVVzA).

The combination worked well as they clearly crafted the texture to make the variety similar to that of a rainbow roll. My second roll was the $16 Surprise Ending, which puts big red beet slices at center stage with kale, avocado, asparagus, shredded tofu, rice crackers, seaweed pearls (again?), and spicy aioli in supporting roles (photo: https://bit.ly/2WbILzF). They list &apos;suspense&apos; as the last ingredient, but I couldn&apos;t tell if it was something you eat or the sense of anticipation you&apos;re supposed to have before you eat it. Guess I&apos;m still in suspense.

FOOD - 4 stars...creative vegan execution of familiar sushi rolls...they should offer no-rice options if you ask me
AMBIANCE - n/a...could only peek inside since I took it home
SERVICE - 4.5 stars...friendly and thoughtful 
TOTAL - 4 stars...I can come back since I must&apos;ve met the weight requirement 

RELATED - Going vegan? Here&apos;s a collection of places I&apos;ve tried and reviewed: https://bit.ly/2Gsrryj"
5,"So happy that I finally tried this place!! It really was worth waiting an hour for our pick up order. This place is tucked away and a bit hard to find but it truly is a hidden gem. For the specials we tried the Body and Soul roll and the Hidden Agenda roll. I also got an order of Philly rolls because cream cheese. ;) I&apos;ll start with my negative feedback first. I wasn&apos;t big on the Philly roll because I expected the cream cheese to be a bit more solid and the  imitation meat had a hammy taste to it. My boyfriend liked it though.

BUT. The other rolls were unbelievably good. For being purely vegetable based, they really know what they&apos;re doing. The flavors were out of this world. I really loved how they got eggplant, zucchini and bell pepper to taste like actual sushi. It was mind blowing and my mouth is watering just thinking about it... everything was the freshest, highest quality you can get. Easily one of the best sushi restaurants in the Bay."
5,"First time trying Vegan sushi and I was impressed! 
I loved the Hidden Agenda roll. It&apos;s packed with different veggies and is so full of flavor that I didn&apos;t even need soy sauce! 
The wait for 5 rolls and sides was about 45 minutes on a Sunday evening, so plan ahead."
5,"Due to shelter in place, we looked at the menu online (https://www.shizensf.com/menu), ordered pickup at around 5pm on a Thursday, and our 3 specialty rolls were ready by 5:40pm. 

We got the Prime Suspect, Boddy [sic] and Soul, and Hidden Agenda. My favorites were in the below order:

1. Prime Suspect ($15) had eggplant on top and as well as little toasted rice krispies. I really enjoyed the texture and the flavor and would get it again.
2. Boddy and Soul ($16) was pleasantly spicy. The spicy seitan-textured garnish was really flavor and a good flavor add to the sushi, plus there was extra and was good with other sushis.
3. Hidden Agenda ($14) is tempura eggplant in rice with a rice wrap on top, and it was a little less crispy since the tempura was inside the rice and it had been sitting out for a while.

After tip, our order came out to be around $60 which to be honest was a lot more than I was expecting. I normally don&apos;t tip on pick-up or counter serve orders, but due to shelter in place and my support for Shizen, I chose to do so for this order."
5,"If you&apos;re a shameless carnivore like I am, don&apos;t let Shizen&apos;s distinction as a vegan sushi bar and izakaya turn you off. You&apos;d be hard-pressed to tell that there isn&apos;t any meat or seafood in what you&apos;re eating.

As Shizen&apos;s name suggests, it offers lots of vegan &quot;sushi&quot; and &quot;sushi rolls,&quot; as well as a large menu of small plates. I started with a couple of rolls, including the &quot;mistaken identity&quot; which looked like it had eel on it, but instead had grilled eggplant and avocado, among other accoutrements. The &quot;boddy and soul&quot; roll, meanwhile, looked like it could be a fried crab meat roll, but instead had spicy bean curd, tapioca, negi,  ito togarashi, and sesame. As if these rolls weren&apos;t satisfying enough, the agedashi tofu was well-portioned and provided plenty of protein to round things out.

Things can get quite busy here, especially on weekend nights, but service is reasonably friendly and efficient once you get a seat. A great experience overall no matter if you&apos;re an herbivore or omnivore."
5,"Vegan sushi!? Why would you (if you&apos;re non vegan) get vegan sushi!? Well, I totally get the hype. Thanks to Shizen.

I&apos;m eating a plant-based diet this month and had mad cravings for sushi. I live in south bay (near mountain view) and there isn&apos;t any that seemed appetizing (it was all just cucumber or avocado rolls... boring). Until I stumbled upon Shizen. And yes, I drove 45+ minutes JUST for vegan sushi. And would I do it again? Heck yeah. Even if I wasn&apos;t vegan this month and if I was in the area I&apos;d totally get this again.

We ordered the Hidden Agenda, Proud Peacock, and Boddy and Soul. Presentation was great - asked for extra ginger and soy sauce and they happily provided. Wait time was LONG - about an hour plus, so call ahead!

We found an easy parking spot in front so we just decided to chow down. At first glass WOW, it looks like a real specialty roll sushi dinner! Vegan or not it looked amazing. When we first took a bite our eyes WIDENED. We looker each other not knowing what to expect prior to that first bite, took that first bite, and our jaws dropped. Seriously. I don&apos;t know what was on top of that Peacock roll and the Hidden Agenda but both were so delicious. Perfect rice blend and whatever they used on top of the peakcock roll as &quot;fish&quot; and inside the hidden agenda as tempura. So good. The boddy and soul was great too but the hidden agenda.. 10/10 would write about again. Love the crunch and the flavors meshed well together. Wow. If this is vegan sushi maybe I won&apos;t mind extending my plant based diet. Or even go when I&apos;m on a regular diet. It&apos;s so good! A bit pricey nearing or at $15 per roll but I was full after sharing 3 rolls with my partner. She said the same thing and was amazed vegan sushi could be THIS good. Wait time long yes, but worth it for simply divine sushi - for vegans and nonvegans alike."
