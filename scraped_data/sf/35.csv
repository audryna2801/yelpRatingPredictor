5,"I have no idea how to say Suppenküche (soup-in-cooch?) so I&apos;ve been calling it &quot;that German place in Hayes Valley.&quot; Even then, people know exactly what I&apos;m talking about. I absolutely love German culture (guten tag, bitches) and was so glad to have randomly stumbled upon this place after a night out in the city. There&apos;s no denying that Suppenküche serves up the best German food in the Bay Area, and anyone who says otherwise is trippin&apos;.

The outdoor dining area is perfect for a night out, but I&apos;ve only ordered takeout so far. I&apos;ve had the must-haves: pretzel with cheese, potato pancake, and bratwurst (x2) with sauerkraut, and I loved them all. Suppenküche can throw it down in the kitchen!!! The pretzel was freshly baked and full of flavor, but the real MVP was the cheese that came with it (you could also get mustard, but cha boi loves his cheese). I dropped ~$14 for one of these bad boys, which is more than I&apos;d like to spend on a pretzel, but this isn&apos;t your average mall pretzel! The potato pancake had an amazing crisp to it, even as takeout, and the applesauce made it all the more better. Definitely order these for the table (or for yourself... you could totally eat these as a stand-alone meal).

Parking around here is tough (I mean, it&apos;s SF), but I&apos;m usually able to find a spot on Grove St. This place gets busy on nights and weekends, so place your order well ahead of time or get in line before the dinner rush to avoid an hour-long wait. But even then, I&apos;ll wait my ass in line if it came down to it because the food is that good. I always find myself coming back here when I&apos;m in the area, even if it&apos;s just for a pretzel. Suppenküche is definitely on my list of all-time faves!"
5,"On a cold wet night there is nothing better than the ultimate comfort food of Suppenkuche. Fresh, hot and well packaged food for pick up made everything easy and safe. Everyone masked and distanced. Thank you. Looking forward to a warm dry night when there is nothing better than a cold German beer and a bratwurst."
5,"We had takeout for 4.
Vienna Schnitzel  were tasty and perfect.
A real German had Jaeger Schnitzel and he loved it!
Good simple green salad, red cabbage , sauerkraut,
Potato pancake?  all fresh and delicious.
In freezing SF night we had really warm and nice dinner!"
1,"A German friend is visiting SF so I wan excited to take him to this place. What a disappointment! 
Besides the limited options, food was sub-par and overpriced (my friend actually thought: I should move here and have a German food truck!) 
Special mention to the server lady. Horrible attitude!! 
I told her I have dietary restrictions so only no-pork sausage and mash potato. She said the kitchen would be confused and she rudely decided she would give me the sauerkraut no matter what. To my surprise that comes with chunks of bacon. It was all over the dish, meaning  I couldn&apos;t eat anything...
Waste of 55 dollars + (a well undeserved) tip."
4,"** The following review reflects my takeout experience DURING the COVID-19 pandemic. **

I kinda feel silly reviewing Suppenküche all these years later since I used to come here often in its formative days back in the nineties. That was when I was also in my formative years because I remember sitting at their communal table with my buds and hoisting a few pints while wolfing down schnitzel with noodles. I remember cream-colored ponies and crisp apple strudel and wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings. These were a few of my favorite things. Oh wait, I&apos;m mixing up my thirty-something years with &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.

It must be the whole German vibe because for no valid reason, I had not been back for decades and yet, I was drawn back by the sight of Currywurst and French Fries on their menu. I first had currywurst when I discovered Curry 36 in Berlin several years back (review: https://bit.ly/3jr7QkL). I obviously loved it though I only spent three Euros back then. Of course, at $24, Suppenküche&apos;s entree is not the miniature fast food version you eat standing up with toothpicks. This featured a couple of large veal and pork sausages.

They were ladled with curry ketchup and accompanied by a huge pile of thin fries (photo: https://bit.ly/3rsUZRz). It had been so long since I have had fries I was like a kid in a candy store, or more accurately, a kid at In-n-Out. The sausages were tasty. To help alleviate my carb-induced guilt, I also ordered the $13 Gemischter Salat, a mixed salad of shredded carrots and red cabbage, sliced beets, potatoes mixed in a mayo-based slaw, and butter lettuce (photo: https://bit.ly/39TXLJI). It was a delicious blend of crunch and Deutschland flavor. It&apos;s been too long, Suppenküche.

FOOD - 4 stars...Berlin&apos;s fast food staple has become a higher end entree in a box
AMBIANCE - n/a...I remember their space well but I just stopped to get my currywurst 
SERVICE - 4 stars...still friendly and attentive
TOTAL - 4 stars...good to come back even if it took a pandemic to do it

2,"I&apos;m a little surprised and shocked at how completely okay the food was. For $25, I think something more than butter lettuce is required as a side salad. The wiener schnitzel was okay. 

Overall, exceptionally poor dollar value paired with forgettable food makes for a disappointing order out. Not sure if it&apos;s coronavirus and takeout playing a factor here, but I won&apos;t be back for more."
5,Great spot for German food! I loved everything that I ordered. The Weiner schnitzel was delicious!  The sides that I got were the sauerkraut and cabbage. They went perfectly with the weiner schnitzel.
4,"Delicious German food and the best dopplebock beer!!! Outdoor seating available right now during covid.
No reservations."
3,"We ordered take out here this past Thursday. I haven&apos;t had a lot of German food, so can&apos;t compare their meals to other places. We ordered the family meal for 2 and chose the two kinds of schnitzel for our entrees. One is breaded pork loin and the other is sautéed. The meal comes with green salad, mashed potatoes and cabbage or sauerkraut or you can get half and half. 

The salad wasn&apos;t really a salad. It was just lettuce nothing in it with some kind of berry dressing on the side. The other sides were tasty, I liked the mashed potatoes, red cabbage, and sauerkraut. The schnitzel was yummy too but I&apos;m not sure what real schnitzel tastes like. They just tasted like pork loin cooked two different ways but I liked them both. We also ordered a side of potato pancakes. They were nice and crispy but the applesauce and sour cream that came with them were a bit bland and nothing special. 

They do seem a bit pricey but they give large portions for their entrees. The meal for 2 is $48 but comes with two pieces of meat per entree and was enough to feed 4 of us. So $48 to feed 4 isn&apos;t bad, but it is supposed to be a meal for 2. $14 for 3 potato pancakes isn&apos;t worth it though so most likely wouldn&apos;t order those again."
4,"This place came recommended by a friend. This spot is serving authentic German food, as well as offering delivery during COVID-19. I&apos;m so glad! Of course nothing beats the in-person experience, but delivery is a great second option right now.

It&apos;s one of the most popular places in SF. I went to there at that time was super crowded and very loud. The food itself was mediocre for me. Personally I didn&apos;t really like my marinated braised beef. The sauce over it was good. The bartenders were helpful choosing of beers. The beers came out fresh. It was a nice night to be out dining. It&apos;s such a cute little place! Love the ambiance of this place Suppenküche."
5,"Amazing amazing amazing aaaaammmmmmaaazzzziiiinnnngggggggg! 
This is my favorite place to visit when traveling to SF. We were there in December with the full menu."
4,"Great food! The dishes are not very healthy and lacking in vegetables, but that didn&apos;t take away from how good the food was! The potato pancakes were so high quality and a must try.

Only complaint was that it was slightly uncomfortable that some RVs were parked with their doors open right next to some outdoor dining tables."
4,Solid restaurant. Open for takeout during COVID. Their schnitzel is good. They also have a bunch of other niche (in the US) German dishes. Cool place.
5,"I first became intrigued by German food after trying Little Red Riding Truck. Their cheese spätzle was so good that I decided to go on a mission to try it at other restaurants.

Suppenküche&apos;s cheese spätzle was just as yummy! I love that it comes with their house salad/raspberry vinaigrette. I also like to get their potato pancakes, which are served with sour cream and apple sauce. The combo of all three in one bite is definitely worth trying, yum!"
4,"As far as German food goes, there&apos;s not a ton in the city and so I try not to be too picky. With that in mind, Suppenkuche gets it done. It&apos;s not amazing, but it&apos;s pretty darn good considering the lack of German culture in SF. It&apos;s got your staples like schnitzel, and it has considerably generous portion sizes.

Walking in, it&apos;s a little confusing about where you&apos;re supposed to go because there&apos;s no front desk -- or clear indication of where the front desk.. or host/ess is. Service is meh, but I didn&apos;t expect it to be star quality given that the restaurant seems rather casual. . One of my only and biggest complaints though is the heat. We came here during the summer.. on a mildly hot day, and I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any AC inside the restaurant. I started sweating almost immediately and the hot fried slab of chicken (schnitzel) I ordered didn&apos;t quite help with the overheating. I&apos;d say try this spot on a cold winter night when you&apos;re looking for some nice German comfort food, maybe not in the summer.. unless they&apos;ve improved their air flow situation."
4,"Confirmed: most authentic German restaurant in all of San Francisco (possibly the US?). 

I knew pretty much next to nothing about German food, culture, and cuisine but luckily for me, my company had, not one, but TWO interns who were with us for six months in SF and they absolutely adored this restaurant! In their words, not mine, it&apos;s &quot;the best German food [they] have tried in the states&quot;.

Here&apos;s what I recommend ordering:
*Brezel mit Obatzda (not sure if this comes with the traditional Bavarian mustard but ask the staff if it does not!)
*Breaded &amp; Sauteed Pork Loin (Wiener Schnitzelvom Schwein mit Bratkartoffeln)
*Cheese Spatzle in Onion Butter Sauce (Käsespätzle mit Zwiebel-Buttersoße)
*Grilled sausage and sauerkraut (Gegrillte Nürnberger Bratwurst mit Sauerkraut und Kartoffelbrei)
*Radler (traditional lemonade beer I guess? But super yummy!)

Was OK but can skip:
*Red wine marinated braised beef w/ cranberries, red cabbage, and spatzel (Sauerbraten mit Preiselbeerkonfitüre, Rotkohl und Spätzle)

We ordered this for the spatzel but it was kind of tasteless... definitely order the spatzel as a standalone item in onion butter sauce! It&apos;s way better!

I absolutely adore Suppenkuche. 10/10 would recommend checking it out if you&apos;re in Hayes!"
3,"Stopped by here to get some pick up. We&apos;d heard a lot about this neighborhood spot and had high expectations. 

We ended up getting the bratwurst and potato pancakes. 

The bratwurst was a bit of a letdown. The sausages were thin and too lean and dry. While the portion was large, most of it was the mashed potatoes and sauerkraut. The accompaniments were rich and had good flavor. 

The potato pancakes held up well and were nice and crispy. However, the cream dip that accompanied it was pretty bland and one of the pancakes was burnt on the bottom which left an unpleasant taste. 

Overall, I could see this place hitting it out of the park when it&apos;s firing on all cylinders. But based on my experience - my first here - it was just a little too pricey for what we ended up getting."
3,"Why 3 stars? Because my experience was neat but the food was just okay.

   ---   ---   ---

My favorite part of Suppenkuche is that you step inside and immediately feel like you are in Europe, or more specifically, Germany. I&apos;m not sure when this building was built, but the stylings are that of the European time in history rather than San Francisco&apos;s. The &quot;bar&quot; is super inefficient with seating long the walls of a square room, rather than actually... at a bar, but it&apos;s those kind of touches that give this place such unique character.

Seating is communal. I was rocking the party of one reservation and was placed at a 6-top with two couples. One of the couples thought that a crowded communal table was an ideal place to make out in public, which was certainly quite silly, but gave me something to laugh about as I ate. The other couple sounded like they had German accents - a sign that this was probably going to be some tasty food!

Unfortunately, I thought it was just okay. I ordered Jagerschnitzel. Every time I&apos;ve ever ordered any sort of schnitzel, it usually ends up being pretty thin with breading around it. This was a bit of a thicker cut: think pork tenderloin. And if there was breading under the sauce, it was very minimal. I enjoyed the flavor of the sauce and the accompanying potato salad was great, but the main course didn&apos;t quite hit the spot for me.

I&apos;d consider a return here, especially with friends, but I wasn&apos;t blown away overall."
3,"3.5
Cool atmosphere. They have tons of German beers and you can also get a boot. They have two (1L and 1.5L). The food was just ok. I didnt really love my marinated braised beef. I did enjoy the Spatzel though.

Overall, I think this might be a good start for German food, but I prob wouldnt say its the best. However, if you&apos;re in the area and wanted to give German food a try, this place is decent."
4,"I have been to Suppenkuche twice. This second time was with my boyfriend for our 3rd anniversary on March 1st. 
It was very easy to make a reservation too. 
The location, of course, is amazing. The space is really nice and the tables are semi-shared. Another couple shared our table. I had a pork dish that was very good. I just wasn&apos;t exceedingly fond of the potatoes. 
My boyfriend had the special and loved it! The drinks were good too, lots of selection for both food and drinks. 

Cleanliness 5/5
Food 4.5/5
Service 4/5 (she forgot our drinks and we had to ask the bartender to get them but she was very nice and decently attentive otherwise). 
Location 5/5"
