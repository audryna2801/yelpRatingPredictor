5,"I just love this place.  Their sandwiches are perhaps the best I have ever eaten, anywhere.  The service is welcoming.  I really felt valued as a customer.  I love seeing all the little tables scattered outside as patrons wait as their meal is being freshly sliced and prepared.  No piles of presliced stuff here.  Had there not been a pandemic, I would have gawked more at their terrific selection of meats.  But we were just picking up milanese and cubano for the plane tomorrow.  Salads looked fresh and inviting.  May I urge you to go on their website and order the sandwiches directly from them so that THEY get all the money, and dont have to share it with a delivery service.  This truly was a find.  http://www.limoncellostogo.com"
5,"Got to relive a summer vacation in Italy while visiting this lovely neighborhood deli/grocery store. 

First off, I must acknowledge how friendly the employees were. They were kind to answer our questions and inviting. Of course, the best part was the food. The caprese sandwich was simple and filling! A half was plenty for me because I also split a side of the ricotta ravioli (forgot what other ingredients were inside) and the artichokes (apparently from Italy, wow.) So so good and all highly recommended! I could honestly come here weekly for lunch if I lived in the area. 

During Covid, they have multiple outdoor tables for you to enjoy your meal right outside, which was a treat."
5,The most lovely people and amazing lunch spot! Outdoor seating available and also bought some Limoncello to take home!
5,"Tried:
--------
1. Milanese Sandwich - Solid Pastrami. They don&apos;t skimp on the filling (I even ran out of bread for the filling at the end). The pesto spread, roasted red peppers, and pepperoncini prevented the sandwich from being dry and gave it a great texture.

I was never a fan of sandwiches and after trying Limoncello, I understand it&apos;s because I&apos;ve only had subpar sandwiches before. After having such an amazing one here, I may have become a sandwich convert. Will definitely be back to try more things."
5,"I was in town for work, and I was looking for a good sandwich place. Limoncello&apos;s did not disappoint!!

The sandwich was absolutely amazing. I got it spicy and it was delicious!! I really loved the atmosphere as well. Make a point to stop here, you will love it. Everything was fresh and the ambiance was wonderful.."
5,"I&apos;m always in the mood for a delicious sandwich, so after a quick search on Yelp, I was off on my journey to Limoncello...

If you love sandwiches like I do, there&apos;s something on the menu for everyone. With a wide variety of speciality sandwiches that are loaded with different toppings, the choices are pretty much endless. My first attempt here, I decided to go with the siciliano, that Italian combo style sandwich. The  sandwich itself was tasty, and the oil and balsamic on the bread is a nice touch. Given that it&apos;s mostly cured meats, it leans toward salty, so as hangover sandwich, wasn&apos;t the best choice for me, but still delicious nonetheless. 

My 2nd time coming in I decided to go with the Petto di Pollo (spicy), and this right here was D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S! This sandwich was so good I came back 14 hours later and got another one. The mediterranean chicken breast mixed with the toppings, as stated on the menu is absolute perfection. The only difference on my second time around was getting it panini&apos;d which was the play if you enjoy your bread toasty and crunchy. I always prefer toasted bread because it provides a more satisfying mouthfeel and eating experience. 

Most of the speciality sandwiches start at $12.95+, and they load these things up with plenty of greens and proteins. One sandwich is prolly good for two small meals, and a perfect sandwich to bring on park days. The store itself has plenty of beer, wine, and non-alcoholic drinks, plus gelato! Making it one-stop-shop for all things park days or quick lunches. This is definitely going to be in my heavy rotation when visiting family in the area!"
5,"Was craving a sandwich the other night, and Limoncello popped up on Yelp with perfect reviews and bomb-looking sandwiches. I knew I had to try it to see if the hype was real!

My boyfriend ordered the The Cuban and I got The Special, which was packed with all my favorite deli meats: prosciutto, salami, and hot coppa. Both sandwiches were absolutely amazing, though I&apos;ll always go with sandwiches with Italian deli meats over anything else. Funnily enough, the owner is Persian, and I was craving a sandwich because my Persian dad always used to make me sandwiches that had meats like prosciutto, mortadella, and salami. Great minds think alike!

The store itself has a great selection of desserts, Italian groceries, and ice cream. Everything looked so good; I really had to restrain myself! Can&apos;t wait to come back to try their sandwiches and maybe indulge in some gelato.

Pro-tip: order online for 10% off your first order."
4,"I am a sucker for a well built sandwich  

Limoncello has a great selection or cured meats with fresh ingredients. The presentation is clean and sandwiches are made with love. I got the Alpino Sandwich with turkey, bacon and avocado, simple and so delicious. The Caprese Sandwich included fresh mozzarella, sliced tomatoes, basil, balsamic vinegar and salt &amp; pepper. One of my all time favorite sandwiches. The sandwiches were a little on the dry side, a drizzle of olive oil would make it that much better.

I ordered a delicious cannoli &amp; tiramisu to end my evening and a bag of good ole jalape√±o chips!"
5,"Another day, another craving for a great Italian sandwich. My friend recommended we check out this spot to get some stuff before heading to the beach yesterday - it had always been on my radar, but I&apos;ve never actually had a chance to go so I was excited to check it out. We drove over and ordered at the counter and both got the Calabrese (lightly spicy) with coppa, mozz, sundried tomatoes, balsamic, greens and some other goodness. We also ordered some mac salad for good measure, and meant to order cannolis which looked DELICIOUS but completely forgot. Likely my biggest regret of the weekend. The sandwiches were ready about 10 minutes after we placed our order, and everyone working there was extremely friendly.

The sandwich itself was pretty epic - it was gigantic and all of the toppings/meat/chz etc was delicious. It actually did have a nice little kick to it, and I&apos;m glad I went with the lightly spicy instead of the spicy option. Eating the full sandwich covered about 2 meals which was also perfect, and good for the price ($13.95). The mac salad was also delicious, with perfectly cooked little noodles and nice seasoning as well. Also a great bonus - they had a really nice alcohol selection, which I hope to explore a bit more during my next visit. 

Super excited to have another great Italian deli in the city to go to, and can&apos;t wait to go back and try more menu options!"
5,First time and it&apos;s excellent. The staff are kind and accommodating. Mafioso and Blt are on hit. I&apos;ll be back again.
5,"5 star sandwich and 5 star service. 

I can&apos;t believe this was my first time checking out limoncello.  I usually make my way to molinari&apos;s every time but wanted to venture out.  Yes, there are other amazing sando spots in the city!

I ordered the special sandwich:  Prosciutto, Hot Coppa, Salami, Fresh Mozzarella Cheese with Organic Mixed Greens, Tomato, Pepperoncini, Olive Spread, Black Pepper, Olive Oil &amp; Balsamic Vinegar...all on dutch crunch.  Also added spicy spread for an extra buck.  

I loved it.  The bread was hollowed out so I could taste all of the ingredients.  Everything in the sandwich was super fresh and the flavor profile was spot on.  

The lady at the counter knew peeps by name.  Super bonus there.  

Add a cannoli and you&apos;re good to go.  Looking forward to a return."
5,This place is the best sandwich spot easy to find great Italian choices. I chose the Cuban sandwich love the taste of lemon in it will definitely return to try the rest
4,"Who doesn&apos;t love a good sandwich?! It was my first time here and honestly have been wanting to try them out. 

Conveniently, I was able to place my order online and just pick up when I arrived, yay for ordering ahead. The sandwich deli is inside of the store in the back. They also sell pizza as well and a nice selection of salads.

Sandwich was pretty good, I ordered the turkey on Dutch roll. They&apos;re very generous with their toppings and meat, you can easily share one sandwich with two people. I will say, the only downside was that my sandwich was a little dry, next time will have to ask for extra sauce!"
2,"Once a 4 now a 2 sadly . I&apos;ve been coming to Limoncello for years and sadly they just aren&apos;t what they used to be. Twice in the last few months I&apos;ve ordered on door dash. Both times they send really stale bread, don&apos;t bother toasting, skip half the main ingredients, or ignore special instructions (without attempting to contact you). 

Id love to see the pride in quality sandwiches they used to have, come back again, so we can continue to support small businesses during these times!"
5,"Picked up some subs before our hike in Point Reyes. The man at the register was very kind. He seemed like he really loved what he was doing. He recommended two subs. 
1. The meatball sandwich 
Everything about this sandwich was on point. The meatball were soft and crumbled in all the right way when you bit into it. The bread was nice and soft. The sauce wasn&apos;t too tomatoey. The cheese melted into the sauce. 
2. The Milanese 
I ordered the Milanese because it didn&apos;t have mayo and had pesto inside. There was a good amount of pastrami and salad. The dressing wasn&apos;t oily at all  and the pesto brought a brightness to the sandwich. I felt like I was eating two sandwich in one. I did share my sandwich with my boyfriend and he wish there were more cheese but I thought the amount was fine so if you love cheese ask for more of it."
5,"** The following review reflects my takeout experience DURING the COVID-19 pandemic. **

Do you know what motivated me to experience La Dolce Vita at this decidedly Italianate spot in Pac Heights? Sophia Loren. Yes, I just watched her in her Mamma Mia glory at age 86 in &quot;The Life Ahead&quot;, and all her classic movies with de Sica and Marcello filled my head. With all of us in lockdown, this is the next best thing to a walk on the Via Veneto where you can stop for a cappuccino and talk with your hands. Like Sophia.

I came in after taking a roundabout walk in the Fillmore and decided I needed a Large Latte and they had one for $4.85 (photo: https://bit.ly/2L8pHQj). To go, of course, for these are the times we live in. But I still had enough time to peruse their sizable collection of wine and limoncello (photo: https://bit.ly/2Idmr52). Molto bene. Their deli counter looked enticing with quite a wide selection of sandwiches and a few pizzas and pastas. I&apos;ll come back for a takeout order. Ciao bello.

LATTE - 5 stars...seductive latte on a rainy afternoon
AMBIANCE - 5 stars...such an inviting shop...bellissima
SERVICE - 4.5 stars...polite, no hands
TOTAL - 5 stars...ciao Sophia!

5,"I came back to try another sandwich today and it was just as good as the first, if not better.  I got the Goodfella and I could just tell that all of the ingredients were high quality and fresh. The basil especially came through and was a nice touch with the balsamic!  I really loved the combination of ingredients in this sandwich."
5,"Every time I enter this deli I&apos;m always greeted with the warmest welcome and smile from the staff and it just makes my entire day. I&apos;ve come here 5+ times now, and every time I leave with a brighter and happier mood. The sandwiches are fantastic and I always get the Mafioso or Goodfella sandwich (don&apos;t forget to make it spicy!) you really can&apos;t go wrong with either of them. 

Now I totally understand why this place has 1000+ 5 star ratings... keep up the great work!!! :)"
5,"I had The Goodfella. Very fresh ingredients. Decent amount of meat. I don&apos;t like a sandwich that is dripping with mustard, mayo or sauce. This sandwich was perfect with just the right amount of spicy sauce. The person that works the register does not make the sandwich. The person making the sandwich wore gloves and a face covering."
4,"I had a super random craving for meats, cheeses and bread--so basically a sandwich--so I decided to check this off my bucket list. The shop is both an Italian grocery store and a deli that serves up Italian-style sandwiches. All of their sandwiches come with quality meats that are hand sliced, with just the right amount of ingredients. My friend ordered the Milanese and I ordered the Calabrese and both were good! If you&apos;re looking for a proscuitto-mozzarella sandwich, the Calabrese is the way to go. The meat was spicy and delicious, but I do wish the mozzarella was more pronounced--they skimped on my sandwich which was a bummer. I took a bite of my friends Milanese sandwich and I liked it better, probably because of the pesto sauce. 

However, I do wish there was an option to toast the sandwich! I took the other half home and heated it up, and it tasted even better!"
