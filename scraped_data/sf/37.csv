5,"Philz has been my tried and true for years now. There&apos;s not much to say tbh. I&apos;ve never been disappointed. Iced Mint Mojito, sweet and creamy is my go-to, always. Occasionally, I&apos;ll order an Ecstatic for something less minty and sweet. 

I&apos;ve been to this particular location a few times pre-COVID and during. Their current ordering process is super easy. I place my order through their app and my order is ready in about 7-8 minutes. The app is super user friendly and it&apos;s easy to customize your order to your liking. You are able to walk in the shop but only enough to order/pick up your online order. There&apos;s 2 separate windows and I love that for the online order pick up window, they&apos;ve organized it by first names (?) and even have the table marked off as well. That gives me peace of mind knowing others aren&apos;t touching my cup to check if it&apos;s their order. 

FYI: parking can be a little difficult in the area. Definitely not legal (and definitely not advising to do so lol) but we usually just double park real quick and one of us hops out to pick up our order!"
5,"The original! I love this spot for coffee. The staff are amazing people. They&apos;re super chill, accommodating of whatever you want your coffee to be. I like the kinda grungy feel of the 24th street location, that is before COVID-19. 

Just a tip for you - don&apos;t drink their coffee on an empty stomach! It&apos;s pretty strong stuff."
5,"I love coming to the original Philz whenever I am in the mission. Philz has become such a trendy spot with their LA locations so it&apos;s nice to come here and see where they started out originally. The original Philz is situated in a vivacious, tree-lined Mission neighborhood With a bunch of small businesses and a true neighborhood feel. 

If you haven&apos;t been to Philz you should probably know there&apos;s a specific way to order (LOL). State the coffee you want, level of creaminess you want your milk to be at, the type of milk you want, and level of sweetness for your sugar. Example: Silken Splendor, with creamy oat milk, light sweet.  

As a vegan I love that they offer oat milk now but do miss their vegan donuts. Philz - please bring the vegan donuts back!"
5,"I love Philz, I&apos;ll always love Philz. Something about that iced mint mojito coffee with almond milk, made extra creamy and sweet always hits the spot during hot summer days! It&apos;s so freaking refreshing! 

I love how Philz always lets you customize your coffee however you want it. They also let you try it before you leave. They want to make sure you love it. 

For the people who have never had Philz in their life, I always recommend my favorite: The iced mint mojito coffee! I get so excited to introduce this drink to people. I can&apos;t help it, it&apos;s that good!

Their coffee is not cheap but it&apos;s well worth it. It&apos;s definitely a great treat every once in a while.

This location is in the Mission District and blends really well with the surrounding areas of the Mission district. It&apos;s cute and fun.  

Yes, please do visit Philz!"
5,I decided to try Philz for the first time today and ordered the Mint Mojito - which I heard was a classic. It was great! And I was pleasantly surprised by the very very mild mint aftertaste. I personally would have preferred a darker roast. I would love to try their other drinks next time.
3,"Came here on Christmas this year and was super lucky that I can refresh the app like no other because I was able to squeeze an online order instead of lining up in the worlds longest line Christmas morning. However, being the original one, I had high hopes. And those hopes were crushed a little. The coffee was not the same here and my family reaffirmed it when they tried their drinks. It could have been because they were the only Philz open so they must have been BUSY. But yes, was unimpressed by their coffee this time around. I&apos;ll have to give them another try on a regular day."
4,"Hello everyone! 
This was a good Monday to get a coffee from a new place. I know that now in unprecedented times many places face many lacks with their service. But I truly believe that the Yelp community has to be informed about customer experience even through this new normal. So let&apos;s dive in!
This Philz Coffee place has a good location for pedestrians but a terrible location for parking your car. Be ready to pay a couple of dimes for parking if you want to taste a good coffee. A street was busy and I didn&apos;t find any free parking in the area around, only parking meters.
As you can see in my pictures, you can make your order right in front of the entrance. I have to say, right now they have got a very poor menu: only a couple of options for coffee and tea. You can&apos;t buy here any food. They even don&apos;t have got syrups, only sugar. In my eyes, a few customers didn&apos;t buy anything, because they don&apos;t have a simple latte. There is no sitting area, so be ready to stay a couple of minutes waiting for the order. 
But I have to say, they have got an impressive list of sorts of coffee beans. If you are connoisseur like me, you will be pleasantly surprised.
More of this, I have to say that the waiter was super nice and friendly. He helped me to choose the right drink for me and gave me advice about where I can buy some food if I am hungry. 
They are doing a great job of preventing the spread of COVID-2019. They are providing hand sanitizer, you are mot allowed to sit inside, they have got contactless pay and contactless pick-up your order, the waiter is wearing the mask and gloves.
In the end, right now I would recommend this place for coffee lovers hanging out or working in the area around and everybody who wants to help this business."
3,"A store with lots of character seemingly designed for the professional coffee drinker. Unlike Starbucks, you specify the flavors you are looking for. Kind of intimidating for someone who just wants a mocha. 

But here is where it falls of the rails for me. After 20 minutes, I felt like my head was going to explode. I thought my ears were bleeding. I could feel my pulse in my eyes. 

This stuff is super strong. Red alert!!!"
4,"That&apos;s a pretty reasonable option to have a nice coffee and get it very quick because sometimes time is money for sure. Some of my friends say there are problems with the app sometimes but I didn&apos;t face this problem. The coffee selection is very rich but my choice in the morning is always something strong to wake myself up and they&apos;ve got some what really made me happy. Strong and bracing. To make it short, nice coffee and strong service. See ya next time Philz."
4,"You know by now that Philz is a phenomenon you can&apos;t stop... I&apos;m just here to give a couple tips:
- First, the Philzharmonic is bomb but doesn&apos;t include a decaf option by default.  So order a &quot;philzharmonic style decaf.&quot;
- Bring your own damn cup even if it&apos;s a sports bottle for iced coffee!  It&apos;s a bargain... they charge you for a small and give you a ginormous."
5,"Silken Splendor, Mint Mojito, and Philtered Soul Cold Brew...put those on repeat, day after day. The product is solid at all locations and the app is super easy to use. The location on 24th &amp; Folsom is always super clean with people that are happy to be working together. Great spot for some caffeine!"
5,I love philz. I wish they had it in TX too... I&apos;d always drink their mint mojito coffee but tried the rose one this time and really liked it! :)
5,"Please open Philz Coffee in the Seattle area! I loved everything about this coffee shop. The ambiance - it was so inviting. Painted walls, ceiling, lots of comfortable seating. And the baristas full of contagious energy. But most importantly, I tried the mint mojito coffee and it changed my life. Who knew that fresh, muddled mint in coffee would be perfection? I&apos;m so happy I stumbled upon this place on my walk through the Mission District, and it&apos;s on the top of my list the next time I&apos;m in San Francisco."
5,"Very quick friendly service. The vibe of the atmosphere is great lots of seating- couches, tables, mellow music and unlike other coffee shops I do not hear the conversations of others. The place lives up to its reviews because the beverages taste good and it is a cool place to read, have a quiet conversation or to just go sit and have a cup of coffee. I like that they can make beverages to preference asking how much sugar, milk or creamer one wants in their drink. I also, liked that the person making the drink offered to fix the drink if I wanted it a little sweeter- the employee did that without me asking - very good customer service. I would recommend this place and plan to return."
4,"TALK ABOUT SUPER FROTHY! 

Stopped by on 24th to grab my regular &quot;ecstatic iced coffee&quot; extra creamy and extra sugar. I wanted a cup of coffee that was going to have me jumping off the walls going &quot;Ku-Ku for Cocoa Beans right before work, mission accomplished I&apos;m hyped up.

The Philz Coffee Team here is awesome. I love it that they ask you is your coffee to your liking and the consistency to your preference, so they can make a change. Their set-up station in how you pick your order up and pay for it, to me is a bit &quot;backwards.&quot; I could tell a few newcomers were somewhat puzzled and didn&apos;t know whether or not  to wait or just go ahead and pay for their coffee in advance. 

I&apos;m pretty sure just like the one in San Mateo, you order first and then pay. I would have to say Philz is better than Blue Bottle Coffee. That&apos;s right I said it and &quot;I&apos;m sticking to my guns.&quot; (;"
5,"If you&apos;ve never heard of or been to a Philz Coffee, Mission Philz is worth a visit, because it&apos;s the first ever Philz Coffee that opened in 2002. The coffee, of course, is what everyone comes here for and although I don&apos;t drink much coffee, my husband swears by Philz. Unlike most other coffee shops, Philz does drip coffee and is a lot stronger than an equivalent espresso coffee drink. 

Also, unlike other coffee shops, Philz has a unique take on ordering coffee. As soon as you enter Mission Philz, if you don&apos;t see a line, go all the way to the end of the store behind the bench (look for the signs), and wait for a barista to call upon you. Once they call you, you tell them what kind of coffee you want and which size you want. Philz believes in &quot;making it perfect&quot;; so, there&apos;s no milk and sugar station in this coffee shop. If you need more of something--like cream or sugar--you go back to the barista who made it for you and they&apos;ll help you out. If you&apos;re like me--that is you enjoy a creamy, sugary drink and would never drink black coffee--go for either the Mint Mojito or the Ecstatic iced coffees; I like to get mine &quot;sweet and creamy&quot;. If you&apos;re not sure, the baristas are really friendly and will help you pick a coffee (or tea). 

After ordering, you head on over to the front of the store, near where you entered, tell them what you ordered and they&apos;ll charge you. (Yes, they rely on your honor to tell them what you got.) This is also your chance to get some food. In the last few years, most Philz Coffees--including the Mission one--have started carrying a selection of baked goods (like some yummy almond croissants from local bakeries), pre-made burritos, and freshly-made bagels. My husband and I sometimes get breakfast here when we&apos;re in a rush; our favorites are the Philz Bagel on Za&apos;atar and a warmed-up almond croissant.

After paying, head back to where you ordered and wait for the same barista that you ordered with to call your drink. There&apos;s a bench that you can sit and wait on while your drink is made; it usually takes a few minutes. 

Once you&apos;ve had Philz, be warned that you may become a regular (like my husband)! One of the great things they&apos;ve done recently is introducing a mobile app that lets you preorder and have the coffee be ready for pickup when you get there. This is a huge time saver! These days, my husband almost always uses the app to order.

Lastly, while all the newer Philz&apos;s have chic, modern interiors, it looks like Philz has intentionally kept this first one true to its beginnings and the Mission. Both outside and inside, nothing seems to have changed since 2002, and while it may not be as fancy-looking as some of the newer ones, once you visit this one, it&apos;ll have a special place in your heart."
4,"Coffee: 5 stars
Service and communication: 2 stars 

They say this is the OG Philz so that&apos;s exciting. And I understand service changes from day to day or even hourly based on the customer climate and other variables. But 7AM on a work day when the baristas are chatting it up with each other, I find that a bit disrespectful. 

There is a great option to order online and just pick up - this is definitely the only route I will go from now on if it&apos;s a grab-and-go situation. 

Bottom line, Philz is delicious. Get the large Tesora with cream. Like sweet? Ask for sweet! Like really sweet? Ask for really sweet!"
5,"Why 5 stars? Because we&apos;re all better for Philz existing. 

   ---   ---   ---

I&apos;ve written many reviews for different Philz locations, which all tend to go something like this: &quot;OMG I love Philz, why can&apos;t they be in Florida? Mint Mojito, yum. Philtered Soul, marry me.&quot;

I&apos;ve often wondered if there was even a point in continuing to copy/paste that text on the Yelp page of each location that I visit across California. And the answer is - probably not. But for the original Philz, I&apos;m freaking doing it.

Phil... Mr. Phil... Dr. Phil... whatever your name is - thank you. Thank you for inventing the greatest coffee shop in the USA. I do wish you would let my wife and I open your first franchise location in Tampa, Florida. I promise we&apos;d keep everything as meticulously perfect as it would be if you yourself were keeping an eye on the quality control every day.

Anyway, your original location is even more awesome than all the others. Same great coffee + extra photos of you on the wall and some extra character/charm.

As has been the case at every location, my coffee was worth killing a stranger over. I gradually sipped on my 20 oz medium sweet Philtered Soul for the next several hours and it poured me through a day of wandering the streets of SF. I&apos;d be such a productive member of society if I could only have this on a daily basis. 

Cheers to Phil for bringing us the most important invention since the light bulb."
5,This location of Philz is BOMB!!!! Staff are all friendly and my drink always comes out perfect. They definitely get me through my 12.5 hour clinical days. This week I also got a bacon breakfast burrito and that was pretty decent too. I really love that I can order ahead and the app tells me who made the drink with a pic!!!
5,"The OG Philz!

This Philz location was actually the first one I ever got to try their delicious iced mint mojito at, so it was pretty cool to learn at that visit that this was actually where it all started.

Fast forward to now, I&apos;ve tried just about everything on their menu, and have not been disappointed. To be fair, there have been some times where my drinks have been lackluster, but the baristas have always been eager to fix them. This is something that I really appreciate since I&apos;ve gone to other coffee shops in the area where baristas will seem extremely annoyed if you ask them to remake your drink.

Nowadays, I&apos;m more of a tea kind of gal, but I would still definitely recommend the iced mint mojito if it&apos;s your first time visiting. If you are in the mood for tea, my go-to&apos;s are an Istanbul treat (light cream, light honey, extra mint leaves) or a half green tea/half black tea (light cream, light honey, extra mint leaves).

If you&apos;re contemplating going to Philz, just do it! Promise you won&apos;t regret it- especially this location with its quirky ambiance, comfortable seating, and its friendly baristas :)"
