5,"My friend and I came here for a galentines date and popped ourselves into the Yelp waitlist on our drive up from East Bay--and I&apos;m so glad that we did. We got there a little bit before our check-in time but ended up having to wait an additional hour because they were so packed. 

But for good reason! We had their walnut bread, their prosciutto pizza, and squid ink risotto (with two glasses of one of their red wines) and everything was delicious! I was the most pleasantly surprised by their walnut bread and got it solely because there were so many reviews about it on Yelp and it did not disappoint. Their pizza had a yummy chewy crust and the prosciutto on top was delicious. I think their risotto was just alright but that might be because everything else was so good.

Their outdoor seating set up is also very cute and they have enough heated areas that I wasn&apos;t freezing while eating. A great spot for a date or a night out w friends! If you could I would recommend hopping on their waitlist so you can reduce the time you spend waiting outside in the cold (and also the Walnut bread)."
5,"Beretta still keepin&apos; it up even on take out orders!

Food as always were awesome! They really do care for the quality of it for you to enjoy your food. They even have a warm message of appreciation and instructions on how to best reheat or eat it at home since they cant serve it piping hot like when you dine in. I&apos;ve always love beretta and will continue to support it! Thank you guys! You&apos;re all awesome and keep it up!"
5,"So, I&apos;ve been come to Beretta for a long time over the years.  This includes dates, takeout, or just because!  Honestly, this place is perfect for any of these circumstances!

Date Nights - It&apos;s always somewhat lively (pre-covid), and I think that makes for an awesome vibe for date night!  Service is always excellent, and the drinks are fantastic (during this covid era, you can get them to go!).  If you&apos;re outside and it is cold, they have really good heat lamps.  Inside is always great, too.  I think I&apos;ve tried just about all of the dishes offered here, and quite frankly they are always fantastic!  If you&apos;re 21+ I highly recommend getting mixed drinks.  They may be a little pricey, but honestly they are worth it!

Takeout - While you don&apos;t get the dining experience, the food is still great and there are mixed drinks to go!  They are pretty quick to make everything, and are as friendly for takeout as they they are when dining in!"
3,"Had lunch with some girlfriends on a Sunday afternoon. We each ordered salads and split the arancini and the burrata pizza between the 4 of us.

Would recommend the beet salad! It was just the right size as a lunch entree and while filling, was very light and refreshing. I wanted to love the pizza (bc who can say no to bread, sauce and burrata?) but it was way too soggy for my liking.

The service was great for the most part but the biggest issue throughout our meal was the heat - it was one of those random SF weekends when it was super super hot out and our table was directly in the sunlight. We and the neighboring tables politely asked our servers if there was any way they could put the umbrellas out over the tables, and they responded saying that it was still too early in the day? We thought that was super odd and all ended up having to use our jackets as sunshades to avoid getting burnt..but at least they brought us some extra cups of ice to cool down? 

Not sure if this can be controlled but the bathrooms were really dark inside. I get that it could be an ~ambiance~ thing, but also can imagine someone who is visually impaired may have a hard time getting around."
5,"They have contactless ordering, nicely spaced and separated outdoor seating areas, and heaters for the evening and winter weather.  Very comfortable and safe dining experience. Everything we ordered was delicious both the food and cocktails."
4,"Having come here for brunch, we had to come for their dinner (of course after creepily stalking the place to see how crowded they were, we were comforted by the fact that the staff took distancing very seriously and that the tables across from the parklet were nicely distanced). 

Their drinks were delicious, I think we had the rattlesnake, lonsdale, and diablo(??)- they were all very well-balanced and tasted amazing considering I&apos;ve been making my own quarantine cocktails for 9 months. We ordered the octopus, butternut squash ravioli, and funghi pizza. The food was great, especially considering they went out of their way to accommodate our non-dairy lifestyle (by allergy definitely not by choice don&apos;t come for me). 

We will definitely be back to pretend like life is normal, just having a cocktail and pizza without a COVID care in the world."
5,"This was a pizza place that I was recommended, and for good reason! They currently are available for outdoor dining, with structures built outside for seating. We booked reservations beforehand, and it didn&apos;t take us too long to get seated. The waiters were nice and accommodating with our orders.

    For the pizzas, we got the Margherita pizza and the Calzone pizza. Both of these pizzas seemed to have been made with very fresh ingredients and you can taste it in the flavor. The Margherita pizza in particular was super flavorful, with the ingredients in it cooked well. The crust is crispy and gives a satisfying crunch when you bit into it, something that I especially like in my pizzas. I would recommend also getting chili oil and pepper flakes with the pizzas, since those always help to enhance the flavor.

    Overall, the pizzas here are great quality and I would recommend coming here if you want artisan pizzas! The portion sizes are pretty good, so two pizzas would definitely be enough for 2-3 people."
5,"We went during brunch time on a Sunday and were able to make a reservation about an hour prior. I highly recommend making a reservation first, because we overheard many people try to dine here, but be faced with an hour wait. The tables inside are very spaced apart and all doors and windows are wide open, so lots of air circulation for these COVID times. The menu is accessed through a QR code posted on every table. 

We started with the Dungeness crab arancini which was so delicious. The crab arancini has such a crispy outside and light, but flavorful inside. I feel like it could have been better if the sauce it came with was spicy, but it was still fantastic. For three people, we shared a Carbonara pizza and a Calzone. The pizzas are decently sized and great for sharing. If you love cheese and egg, the carbonara pizza is the one for you. The calzone has a crispy outside and savory inside.

The improved whiskey cocktail is smooth. The Lonsland cocktail is very refreshing and I recommend it if you love lemon. The Nuestra Paloma cocktail is sweet and great if you love fruity drinks.

The staff was all very friendly and made helpful menu suggestions."
4,"Had Beretta with some gfs pre-pandemic and the most memorable item on the menu for me was the lasagna bolognese. My mom loves lasagna and whenever I go to a Italian restaurant, I will try their lasagna dish to see if it&apos;s worth the rave to my bring my mom to try. And from what I remembered, I told myself I definitely need to bring mom here to try! 

Fast forward to current pandemic time, Beretta is open again and is also doing outdoor seating but we went ahead and ordered to-go instead. This time we ordered the broccolini, margherita, italian sausage, and of course the lasagna bolognese. 

Ordering on their direct site was super easy and you can also pick the time you want to pick-up your order (unlike DoorDash), ordered the food, picked it up and had it back home within 30mins (super fast!). 

As expected, the pies were a little soggy and got a little cold but it was still delicious. The broccolini was standard and the lasagna was just not the same was I had tasted before while dined in the restaurant. Don&apos;t get me wrong, it&apos;s still very good but just not the same... 

Overall I still really enjoyed Beretta but might consider dining there with their outdoor seating so the food comes out fresh and the experience will be as how I remembered."
5,"Get the Carbonara pizza! It&apos;s a 10/10 and one of the favorite pizzas I&apos;ve tried in a while. It&apos;s so creamy, and there&apos;s an abundance of cheese. It balances well with the meat and the eggs are a nice touch. The crust isn&apos;t that fluffy but it has just enough fluff. It&apos;s good for 2-3 people."
3,"Covid take out

I was unimpressed by our meal from here. I really really wanted to like it because of all of the great things I have heard but everything aside from the octopus was just okay. We ordered takeout and that might have part to do with it, but I really was expecting more. We had the fried cauliflower which was good, but it was soggy which was not great. We got the truffle butter bread which was okay, but the bread was pretty cold and the portion was so small. The octopus appetizer was the winner, I would recommend that because it was fresh and flavorful. We ordered the frutti di mare pasta, which honestly could have been better and the portion was pretty small as well. The pizza we got was also decent. Overall, I think I&apos;ll wait until after COVID to come try their dishes as I can tell the food probably could be better if served immediately and fresh."
5,"Beretta is hands down one of my favorite restaurants in SF. I always order way too much because I want to eat a little of everything. The meatballs, brussels sprouts and bruschetta are top on my list. I would eat here once a week if I could afford it. It&apos;s a must try!"
5,"I decided to come here for outdoor dining for my birthday because I didn&apos;t want to cook or order takeout haha. My boyfriend and I got here around 7:15PM on a Sunday with no reservations. Online reservations aren&apos;t available, but you can join the waitlist via Yelp. We waited 15 minutes to be seated outside.

We ordered the following items to share:
-Dungeness crab arancini (5/5): This was my favorite item out of the 3 items that we ordered. This is like a deep-fried risotto ball with crab.
-Lasagna bolognese (5/5): Lasagna is one of my favorite pasta dishes to eat. I thought this lasagna wasn&apos;t too heavy on the cheese. And the tomato sauce used seemed to be more on the creamy side, which I really enjoyed.
-Lamb shank (5/5): I love how the lamb falls off the bone so easily. The sauce goes really well with the lamb. I didn&apos;t enjoy the polenta as much since I&apos;m a bit bothered by the texture haha.

The food here is excellent! I can&apos;t believe I haven&apos;t discovered Beretta earlier. Due to COVID-19, Beretta isn&apos;t able to offer their complete menu. I would definitely come back to try other items on their regular menu when things slowly get back to normal.

The outdoor dining was nice. It&apos;s been many months since we&apos;ve eaten at a restaurant. The service was great. The waiters and waitresses kept checking in on us about our foods or if we needed anything else. There were about less than 10 tables available for outdoor dining. The waiters and waitresses made sure to wipe down the table and chairs before seating new customers. The waiters and waitresses were all wearing face masks as well. They informed the customers that we should be wearing a mask at all times if we are not eating or drinking. If customers need to use the restroom, please let the waiters and waitresses know because they can only have two people inside the restaurant at a time. I think the restaurant provided a wonderful outdoor dining experience!"
3,Was not impressed by the take out. I understand when doing takeout that the food quality won&apos;t be the same as dining in so I would give this place a second chance when I can dine in again. The best thing I had was the crab arancini balls! The crab was fresh and the aoli was the perfect sauce to go with it. The pizza was meh and unfortunately the egg was cooked all the way through. The pasta dish was by far the worst. It was lacking in flavor and didn&apos;t taste very good.
3,"This place is usually the BOMB we order from here at least once a week, but idk what happened tonight, the pizza is (quite a bit) smaller and seems to be different recipe? Not as delicious as normal :( something is different tonight. 
Well give it another go though since this place is usually incredible."
4,"A very cute date night spot or an intimate dinner with the bestie - this place is it. I came here with the BF and we decided to share a few appetizers and order their Osso Buco and their squid ink risotto. For shared plates we ordered the beet salad and meatballs. Everything tasted amazing but the highlight for me was the Osso Buco. It was extremely tender and I personally like tendons and fat so it was generous with both. 

We enjoyed our dining experience during COVID-19 so I only wanted to review the food as reviewing the ambiance and service during this time might be challenging. There is both indoor and outdoor dining, for the option to dine inside there are only a handful of tables, mainly for two people parties. I highly recommend either coming here before the dinner rush (so 5p-530p) or add your name to the waitlist on Yelp to get a head start. This restaurant is also open for takeout so don&apos;t hesitate to order your food to go."
4,"This spot is perfect for a date night. My girlfriend and I visited on a busy friday night (Pro-tip: Put yourself on the waitlist on Yelp to avoid a long wait). The place has both indoor and outdoor seating during COVID-19. We preferred indoor seatings during our visit due to the chilly SF winds. The staff was friendly and they accommodated us for our request.

We wanted to try multiple things off the menu since everything looked quite delicious. We ended up ordering a dungeness crab arancini, butternut squash ravioli, margherita burrata, and the hot salami pizza between the two of us. We absolutely loved the ravioli and the burrata pizza. The neapolitan style pizzas are cooked to a super crispy crust and the burrata was delightfully creamy and buttery. We were really surprised by how ravioli was cooked - instead of being served in a cheesy and creamy sauce, it was soaked in a brown butter onion and garlic dressing. We also ended up getting the tiramisu to go and it was one of the best ones we have had."
5,"This has become a COVID staple for me and my girlfriend. The moment we got the go ahead for reopening, this was the first spot we hit. Somehow this pizza is both extremely wet and extremely crunchy. it&apos;s the WAP of all pizzas. The Margarita Burrata is an absolute MUST! So wet, so crunchy, no idea how they do it. Also do not sleep on the walnut bread and the arancini for starters. Pro tip: if you have the confidence, do a mystery cocktail! They haven&apos;t let me down yet. I got a mezcal old fashioned last time, whatever that means!"
4,"**DISCLAIMER: Pre-COVID review. 

Dining at Beretta was such a lovely experience and is a perfect place to dine-in with friends!! The layout and decor in Beretta is very modern, yet laid back so it adds a nice touch to your dine-in experience. 

The staff here are so lovely and nice, you are greeted with such warm welcome! The wait can be pretty long especially at night and on a friday/saturday but it is worth the wait! There isn&apos;t really a seating area to wait besides the bar..but that doesn&apos;t really count because that will eventually be taken up by people dining in as well. 

My best girlfriends took me out here for my 21st birthday! Such good food, such good alcoholic beverages, and amazing customer service, so friendly and nice! 

The girls and I ordered 2 pizza&apos;s, gnocchi for appetizer, and then for the birthday treat it was on the house. It was a cute little cup with vanilla bean ice cream that had a hint of salt and a cute waffle chip with drizzled olive oil...it was very interesting and fancy. In all honesty it was okay but the effort was honestly the greatest and it came with a lit candle haha. 

Pizza #1: Prosciutto Di Parma and Spicy Italian Sausage (10/10) so darn good I could cry

Pizza #2: Panna and green onions pizza (7/10) 

Gnocchi with Porcini and Smoked Pancetta (10/10) so soft with a perfect chew!! 

I would love to come back here again"
4,"I would say our experience was pretty good. Customer service was so-so. As we were seated, the hostess sort of lectured us on the restaurant policies and made it very clear that the restaurant would be closing soon. Aside from this interaction, our waiter was fairly nice and attentive. It was a busy time so the fact that he checked in on us as much as he did was very nice. Our food was pretty good as well. The lamb shank was a little bland but incredibly well cooked and tender. The wine selection was wonderful! Overall, the experience was decent. Still, I&apos;d love to return and try something else on the menu!"
