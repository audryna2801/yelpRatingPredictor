5,"First time dining here and I will definitely be back. The food is a bit pricey in comparison to the other Thai places in the city, but it&apos;s worth it. 

We ordered the FH fresh rolls (one of their specialties) and samosas for appetizers. The peanut sauce with the rolls were spicy and delicious. The samosa dough was like a sweet puff pastry--so tasty. For mains, we got the pad Thai and green curry. I loved their pad Thai!! I like my pad Thai on the sweeter side (comparable to the version Marnee Thai makes). 

Outdoor seating was comfortable. Heaters for some of the tables and moderately distanced."
5,"Late review, but better late than never right?! 

I am in awe of this place! Pre-covid, I came here right before lockdown and Farmhouse is one of my favorite restaurants in the Bay. Literally everything about this place is amazing. The ambience, food, and staff, *chefs kiss* 

I came here on Valentine&apos;s Day (in 2020) for lunch and luckily got a table! I ordered the Volcano Noodles and my friend got one of the curries. I must say, the volcano noodles got me kind of huffing and puffing LOL but nonetheless, so damn good!!! Their volcano noodles is an off-menu item and definitely a must try. I&apos;m not too sure if they still offer this for take out, but since indoor dining will be available again soon, definitely have to  order this (but obviously at your own risk bc it is SPICY) 

Staff are extremely nice and helpful as well. You can just tell that everybody working here is like family. My experience eating here was just so amazing. I can&apos;t wait to come back and take my friends here bc all of their other food items look and sound great!"
5,"I ordered the Little Lao Table Set which was a giant platter with a variety of different foods. I had 4 people eating with me and this was PLENTY of food. We were stuffed and still had leftovers. Everything was so thoughtfully made and presented, especially for a take out platter. I called to order and went to pick it up in person. They also offer outdoor seating but we wanted to eat comfortably inside our house. The platter came with 2 free thai teas or 2 beers OR one of each which I thought was great. They are enforcing social distancing and for customers to wear masks otherwise no entry which I appreciate so much. 

I will be ordering here again!"
5,"Wonderful place. Great food! 
Love thejr  little lao&apos;s platter!!!!
Will definitely go again."
4,"I called in the order on Valentine&apos;s Day and only had to wait 30 minutes for the Little Lao Set.  It comes with the following:

Samosa:  Light, flaky with mild curry
Egg Rolls
Fresh Rolls with Peanut Sauce
Papaya Salad:  spicy!
Grilled Snake River Wagyu Beef Flank:  tender and juicy 
Hat Yai Fried Chicken:  crispy and juicy...went well with the curry sauce
Shrimp Fried Rice
Pad Thai with Fried Egg:  A little too tart for me
Slow-braised bone-in Short Rib:  tender, moist and super tasty
Spicy Eggplant
Blue Rice 
Thai Iced Tea"
5,"This place offers outdoor dining with a pleasant design of wood tables accented with a green hedge that borders the street. I appreciate the plastic flaps that separates you from other customers and the outdoor heater is a plus. The service started with a strict protocol of questions on health and a temperature check. We got seated super quickly and ordered through their online menu. The Thai tea is beautiful and took a minute to crush but I didn&apos;t mind too much. My fiancé and I came here for a pre Valentine&apos;s date and ordered the Tofu Pad See You, Thai fried rice with Wagyu beef, and samosa. Please try the samosa! It was perfectly crisp and the yellow curry has perfect spice and added a nice texture to the overall palette.

I love super spicy and so the Hotsauce on the side is the one!!! Both our dishes were quite nice balanced paired with the Thai iced tea.
This place is a great option for catering and beautiful presentation for their specials!

Bonus option: they sell $1.75 disposal blanket for us ladies who know the SF wind be getting us sometimes."
5,"Little Lao Set 10/10

Ordered again and even better! Every single item on this tray was amazing! So pleasing to the eye and even better to taste! Feeling a little adventurous? Order this tray you won&apos;t be disappointed. From the tender beef, to the delicious pad thai, and don&apos;t forget that curry! Came with 2 Thai Milk Tea to wash all the goodness down. Overwhelmed with joy. Thanks Farmhouse!"
5,Ordered the Little Lao table set and it was more than enough for two people. The presentation of the food was beautiful! I enjoyed getting to sample many different dishes and getting a drink and dessert! Looking forward to ordering from here again.
5,"As you&apos;ve read a million times - the Little Lao platter is BOMB. I mean it really is the best Thai takeout I&apos;ve ever tasted. Every dish in the platter is excellently executed. Ironically, the item that was the least impressive taste-wise was the most visually striking - the famous blue rice. It&apos;s rice, but it&apos;s blue and pretty. 

The rest of the items - from the pad thai, pineapple fried rice, curry, stir fried egg plant, pad see ew, fried chicken (omg, I didn&apos;t know fried chicken could taste like this), roti, and myriad sauces - were cooked to perfection and with such unique flavors. We were amazed at the sheer size of the platter - it fed two of us for FOUR meals. And all for $60. I would recommend sharing with four friends because the meal is best served hot. Oh, and you get two thai teas on top of it!

The one caveat - they are BUSY, especially on holidays during COVID. We ordered a platter for New Year&apos;s Eve and waited two-and-a-half hours past our originally scheduled pickup time. We could have requested a refund, but the platter was so delicious that we ended up not. Be patient - it&apos;s worth the wait!"
5,"Farmhouse Kitchen Thai sets a high bar for Thai food.  Fabulous flavors meet fresh ingredients in a diverse menu offering sure to please even the most discerning diners.  This is a place I would re-visit over and over and over again.  

We shared the Little Lao for 2 platter and found the portion ample for 3 people, we had plenty of left overs.  Each dish was delectable, well-seasoned, and delightfully presented.  Strongly recommended."
5,"The Vegetarian Little Lao Set is honestly the best takeout food I&apos;ve ever had. I had been to Farmhouse Kitchen before, and knew it had good food but once I saw the Little Lao set on TikTok I knew I had to try it. It is absolutely BEAUTIFUL in person as well, and lived up to the hype. 

The vegetarian takeout platter included - pad Thai, roti and fried tofu with a curry sauce, papaya salad, fried tofu entree, veg duck with pineapple, sautéed basil eggplant, 3 samosas, fried egg rolls, rice paper spring rolls, lettuce wrap things (that were soooo good), fried rice and their famous blue rice. Everything was perfectly portioned out and separated with little plastic containers for dips or entrees so it didn&apos;t mix together. It also comes with 2 drinks (either Thai iced tea or Singha Beer) and a kids box of pad see ewe noodles if you want it. It ended up being $65 after tax and was well worth it. They even include instructions on how to reheat it at home if you need to!  It only took them 15 minutes to put together, and I would HIGHLY recommend trying this platter and going on a picnic during these pandemic times. 

Also as a tip - make sure you emphasize VEGETARIAN little Lao set when you order if you don&apos;t eat meat. The other one is definitely more popular."
4,"So this platter is huge eye candy! So large, so pretty, so much variety! Great for spicing dinner up after so many repeats on lockdown.

Also comes with amazing beef and fried chicken! Honestly, these were the star of the show - and we can only wish there was more of these. Uber Eats has a promo that also includes a pad see ewe which is appreciated (though the quality is just okay), and 2 Thai iced teas which are delicious and great!

Overall, you get a huge assortment of many of their dishes! To be honest, we didn&apos;t really know what we were eating as everyone just dug in, but the meats were great, the noodles were great, the blue rice was great, and the curry is great! I can say if you&apos;re super value conscious, this is still pretty expensive for what you&apos;re getting but if you&apos;re looking for pizazz for your IG, then this is a solid choice for dinner (and leftovers after!)"
4,"My girlfriend wanted Thai for New Years Eve, so I preordered at their website. I found out that they don&apos;t do preorders at their Florida location, so called in about it. The person on the phone (also Sam) assured me that they will make a note about my request, since the SO wanted their spicy crabby curry, along with the Lao set meal. 

In hindsight, I should have just ordered on the day of, but then it was New Years and last time she tried to order, they ran out on the day of. So yeah, don&apos;t be like me and just ask if it&apos;s an option to order everything at one location. I went to the Polk location for the Lao set and Florida location for the crabby curry...haha...smh

The staff at both locations were nice but I think they forgot about the crabby curry, since I had to wait about 10-15 mins after my scheduled time. The parking at Florida location was very tight, so I was glad I found parking close by. 

There was a guy living in a tent nearby. He came up to the line with no shoes on and started talking to himself. That was a little awkward. No mask on either.

These are weird times but I&apos;m glad this place is still open and providing take out orders. Thanks Farmhouse! We enjoyed the food!"
5,"The spicy level is spicyyy! But so delicious. Highly recommend the fried chicken and rice in pineapple (forgot the menu name but see pictures lol), it&apos;s so so good. I liked the Pad See Ew over the Pad Thai, I felt that it wasn&apos;t as dry. This is my 2nd time getting food here and I have yet to be disappointed. Friends and I ordered this on Doordash and it came so quick too, literally took like 20 min. It&apos;s not the cheapest place, but for the quality, it&apos;s worth"
5,"I&apos;ve been a big fan of Farmhouse Thai since before COVID and frequented their restaurant for special occasions (including bdays in which the employees would sing a fun song ft. a rubber chicken). Though those days may be over (for now) their food is still as good as ever! One of my favorite dishes there is their Hat Yai Fried Chicken: the juiciest crispest chicken with an addicting sauce accompanied by roti bread and their famous blue rice (10/10 recommend!). You also can&apos;t go wrong with the more classic dishes like their Pad See Ew. 

Most recently, a group of us ordered the Little Lao Set and it came so quickly and packaged so beautifully! There were 5 of us and we ordered this set and an order of Pad See Ew and we were all stuffed. I was the only person in the group that had ever been to FHT and we ordered based on my avid recommendation and now they are all big fans. Definitely one of my go-to places in the city!"
5,"COVID review - 
I&apos;ve been seeing their Little Lao table platter for the longest time and have been wanting to try it since quarantine started. I was finally able to try it for the first time with a few of my friends this weekend and was not disappointed! In photos, the platter didn&apos;t look like much but in person it was huge! My group of 4 friends ate firsts and seconds and we were still not able to finish everything.

The platter included their most popular dishes like pad thai, pineapple fried rice, curry, stir fried egg plant, pad see ew, fried chicken, roti (and other things that i forgot - it was so much food!) It also came with 2 thai teas all for the price of $60! 

If you and a large group of friends are craving some thai food - i highly recommend this restaurant!"
5,"Seeing the photos that people were posting on IG and how beautiful the pictures were I had to experience it for myself. 

I ordered their Holiday Set for delivery on NYE. The holiday set included the Little Lao Table Set (which I won&apos;t go into here since everyone has pictures and descriptions of it).

It also included the Tsunami Lobster (live 1.5 lb Maine lobster with prawns, PEI mussels, calamari cooked in yellow curry paste, turmeric power and spices), Turmeric rice, Tom Yum Tofu, Spice Tray and Singha Beer.

Everything was beautifully presented and all I had to do was heat it up! I was so hungry to eat that I forgot about the spice tray. The Tsunami lobster and seafood was perfectly cooked and the turmeric rice was so flavorful. It was my favorite out of all the selections.

The Little Lao Table Set was also yummy and we ended up having leftovers for a couple of days. It was definitely a feast for the eyes and stomach.

I will make a trip to the restaurant one day so I can try other dishes."
4,"I&apos;ve dined outdoors and also done their famous Lao table takeout and I have to give this place a solid 4 stars. 

Ambience/Service - 5 stars

 I really enjoyed their outdoor setup. It&apos;s covered, fun with cute lighting and a buzzy/happening scene. I&apos;d say it&apos;s a great place to get drinks and some food with friends. The service was also excellent and quite attentive with the COVID setup well run. Book your reservations in advance!! 

Food quality - 3.5 stars

It&apos;s really more about the presentation and looks than it is food quality. It&apos;s not that their food is bad but for the price, it&apos;s really not worth coming here or getting the Little Lao unless you want a fun time/fun insta pics. Their fried chicken is super yum and I liked the spring rolls in their Lao table. However the pad Thai and shrimp fried rice was really bland and not authentic. I don&apos;t regret trying their Lao table though bc it was filling and beautiful to look at!"
5,"By now everyone must know about Farmhouse Thai and their amazing Little Lao set. It has basically all my favorites off their regular menu, at an amazingly affordable price. I&apos;ve noticed that they&apos;ve toned down the heat on their papaya salad, for those who may have PTSD from their earlier iteration. Can not recommend enough their short rib, crispy fried chicken, roti and curry sauce, and spring roll and samosa appetizers. Even the roast vegetables/cabbage scattered throughout the tray are a treat. COVID takeout done spectacularly!"
5,"Still a Bay Area favorite! 

I was bored and uninspired with all the dishes I was eating at home that I decided to browse Doordash and came upon Farmhouse. I had been to Farmhouse before covid so getting this delivered would be a treat. They have most of the items from there menu available. The best deal is probably the Little Lao Table set that&apos;s enough to feed 3-4 people. You get a little bit of everything in there and two Thai iced teas! I&apos;ve been meaning to write a review for Farmhouse since their chicken was really good and the service was great! They are open for takeout and delivery so definitely support them."
