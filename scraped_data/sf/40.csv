5,"It is no surprise that even in a global pandemic Dottie&apos;s is still an outstanding place for breakfast! The service is still superb which is matched with the fresh tasting 
food.  The coffee is amazing! I travel around the country 20 days a month for the last 3 decades, and I always look for great breakfast places.  It is unlikely 
that you will find a better place than Dottie&apos;s for breakfast. I consider it &quot;a must&quot; if you are visiting San Francisco"
5,"San Francisco in the fall is some of the best weather on earth and this day was a perfect day. Cool with lots of sun. After walking from our hotel in Union Square we stumbled in to True Blue. 

Due to COVID rules we sat on the roof which was perfect and our breakfast was spot on. I&apos;m a sucker for fluffy pancakes. And the pancakes made me happy. I know this place is a famous and favorite in the city and we caught it on a day where it wasn&apos;t extremely jam packed due to COVID.

Despite all, if ever in SF again, I&apos;ll be at True Blue."
4,"Food 4.0/5.0
Service 3.5/5.0
Value 2.5/5.0
Decor 3.0/5.0
Overall 4.0/5.0

I came by to dine on the rooftop during COVID in Dec 2020.  Omelette was great and the server was nice.  Bit really it was quite a surreal experience as I came on a weekday slightly late lunchtime, and the place was practically empty.  No lines at all, only two other tables (3 people total) were already seated and mine was the only table by the time I left.  I lived in SF for a number of years and never ended up at Dottie&apos;s because of the line.  Truly bizzare."
5,"This is now one of my favorite breakfast places in SF. I kept uttering &quot;this is so good&quot; throughout my meal and told my friend I wanted to come back not even halfway through our meal. It&apos;s THAT good!

The inside seems like it&apos;d be small, but it actually has a decent amount of seating. Nonetheless, there was a line out the door at 9AM on the weekend. I think we waited around 30 minutes, so it wasn&apos;t too bad.

We were deciding between the cinnamon roll and coffee cake, and the waitress recommended the cinnamon roll. I&apos;m glad she did!

Cinnamon Roll: HIGHLY RECOMMEND. The absolute BEST cinnamon roll I&apos;ve ever had-no joke. The glaze was light and not super thick. The cinnamon roll was so soft and had the perfect chew-kind of like between a croissant and bread. Most of all, it was moist (I know y&apos;all hate that word, sorry). The inside was wrapped with pecans (or walnuts?) which added a nice crunch to the softness of the roll. Just do yourself a favor and order this, so I can stop trying to explain it.

Black Bean Cakes: RECOMMEND A tasty vegetarian option. We&apos;re not vegetarians, yet we still ordered this and enjoyed every bite. The black bean cakes were moist, flavorful, and topped with pico de gallo and sour cream. Oh, and it gave us our protein! The potatoes were seasoned well, and the eggs were warm (I hate when scrambled eggs come out cold). Lastly, the grilled chili-cheddar cornbread is not spicy (perfect for me). It sounds savory, but it just tasted like normal cornbread to me. I&apos;ve never heard of grilled cornbread before. I liked the black bean cakes better than the cornbread, though."
4,"When I had some friends visiting from out-of-town, Dottie&apos;s was the place to go! There will be a line so get there early and prepared to wait. Portions are large which is nice. 

I tried the lox salmon egg scramble and my friend got the mango French toast. Everything was very good and service was fast and friendly. I really like how it does remind me of the South."
3,"We went to this place for brunch looking at the Yelp rating and no of reviews. Realized on reaching that this restaurant is placed in unbelievably dirty &amp; unsafe locality. You go in with the nervousness of your car&apos;s safety. With Covid situation, rooftop dine in was open and there was hardly anyone at this restaurant due to SIP lifted recently or perhaps it&apos;s location. Outdoor ambience upstairs was actually quite decent. 3-egg omelette, spinach quesadilla and the pancakes tasted very good. 4/5 for the food and service. 1/5 for its location. I feel bad for this cafe being stuck in a shady neighborhood. Hope they can move to a better place and serve their good food."
5,"Made a reservation in advanced and was seated earlier then expected! The food was amazing went for brunch and order the chorizo with eggs, super fast response in receiving the food. Highly recommended."
5,"If there&apos;s a bright side to this year, it&apos;s that a finally got to try Dottie&apos;s. It&apos;s been on my list for ages - but I never managed to go because I&apos;m just not a morning person - and I&apos;m not a fan of walking around 6th and Market at any time of day. That said, it&apos;s a whole different ballgame when I can order takeout and swing by with my bf in a car. There&apos;s no waiting in line, and a limited time in the area.

My favorite? The whiskey fennel sausage scramble. It&apos;s homemade, and you can taste it. We also had the southwestern, which was good, but doesn&apos;t come close to that fennel sausage. We also got a pancake on the side - which was good, but standard. Go for the fennel sausage. 

Portions are generous - one plate can easily feed two people. 

Dottie&apos;s is definitely worth checking out - I can see why they&apos;re so popular and I will certainly be back."
2,"Don&apos;t even bother making reservations because you still have to wait in line! Waited total of 2 hours including serving of the food. I ordered this one plate which I forgot the name, it includes potatoes, ONE sausage that is split in half, eggs, and a french toast that is soooo dry! All this for $20!!!!such a waste of money. Eat somewhere else. I dont know why this place have a nice review?"
3,This place was mediocre at best. Portions were okay and flavor was okay. I probably won&apos;t come again because everything was priced around $18 but the flavors were largely ordinary. My friend said she&apos;s had better frittatas. The location also isn&apos;t superb; it took us a while to find parking and then walk through a semi-sketchy area only to find that rooftop dining was closed (probably our fault for coming at 12:30pm?) so we ended up eating in front of bill graham. Overall a medium experience for mindy.
5,"This is such a cute little place, it&apos;s definitely a hidden gem. The food was great and so tasty! They were so accommodating to my family &amp; I. I love the rooftop seating area it was so cute. Our waiter was so nice &amp; he came to check on us constantly. I will definitely be back."
4,"FOOD: amazing! If you&apos;re not a coffee snob - this is an amazing place to have lunch/brunch/breakfast! They are open even during covid with outdoor seating on the roof terrace. 

SERVICE: also exceptional! Such friendly people and even with being low staffed they did an amazing job, and it was quick! 

COFFEE: horrible. I wanted to love it, but it was not very good. Might be that I have become a coffee snob, but if you are (like me) this is not where to get your coffee! They wrote &quot;expresso&quot; and &quot;capuchino&quot; on theI white board so that says it all  they look really cute and made for great pictures though! 

BUT! Even so! It was 100% worth it to come here! We had a great meal and an amazing view!"
1,"1. They don&apos;t even tell you they are out of stufff  and you wait in line for 40+ minutes 

2. It smells like urine outside and you got no choice but to wait it out cause the reviews are sooo awesome.. got played!!  

3. I only came here for the pancakes for my bf and the stupid hype reviews but now I&apos;m pissed as I wasted 40 mins and I wanted to try the pecan cinnamon roll. They don&apos;t even tell you when they are seating you either.. 

4. Waited 10 minutes to see our waiter n for hiM to tell us they are out of the pecan cinnamon roll, so literally waited a whole hr for crap.. nothing on the menu nor food pics even look like it&apos;s worth drooling over .. so I only ordered potatoes.. 

Not impressed by service or food options. It&apos;s like every breakfast American brunch place.. you would think since there are raves about this place for years they plan on having enough baked goods to last through the day.. but I guess when you make it limited.. you build a hype.. 

Would not come back for this .. I&apos;m not quite sure what I should be impressed with... N the menu nor food pics even look like it&apos;s worth drooling over except the cinnamon pecan roll.. 

So I&apos;m absolutely disappointed and would never even waste my time to recommend coming here ever again.."
3,"First time here.  We were in the city and wanted to eat breakfast/brunch before we started shopping and walking thru Chinatown.

There was a little bit of a line when we got there but the line moved fast. We sat at the bar, our waiter was pretty fast and efficient. Food was good/decent.

This venue has a cool, antique feel to it. The decor is pretty cool, vintage antique style.  

Parking is rather hard, we had to park about 2 blocks away. The walk to the restaurant was ummmmm an experience, the area is questionable."
4,"Unless you are an early riser, I recommend to add yourself on a waitlist available through Yelp to avoid a long wait. While I used that option we ended up waiting nearly an hour as they won&apos;t seat unless your entire party is there. The waiting experience was excruciating but the food and live jazz band made up for it. 

There were quite a number of specials and sweet baked treat options. My group all ordered their own  savory dish and split one pancake between four (it&apos;s large). I picked  the delicious black bean cake breakfast which was a nice vegetarian option. The home red potatoes were cooked perfectly. I washed it down with a nice brut rose. I also had a helping of my friend&apos;s French toast and bacon, both were worth the extra calories!

The one disappointing item agreed by my group was the grilled cheddar cornbread. I didn&apos;t taste much cheddar and it was dry. Perhaps it was just the batch we got. Overall we were quite satisfied with our food, ambiance and chill music for a Sunday brunch."
1,If you like your eggs with a side of conspiracy theory and a Trump supporter you will like this place and love the owner.
1,"Extremely rude waiter. Yelled at my family and told me I am not allowed to use the heater and starts telling me it&apos;s for a different restaurant. 

Unbelievable. 

Food is your basic American breakfast place. Nothing impressive. 

I won&apos;t be coming back and I am extremely disappoin"
5,"Let&apos;s take a walk down 6th street now shall we?   I&apos;m not going to lie.  This isn&apos;t the best of neighborhoods but don&apos;t let it stop you from having one of the best breakfast experiences in SF.  I was the luckiest girl this past Monday 9/16/19 and there was zero wait time.  Not only was I seated immediately (they usually make you wait until everyone in your party has arrived)  but our service was amazing.  

Since I&apos;m cutting carbs, I settled for the Frittata with grape tomatoes, jalapeño, corn, scallions, and melted feta cheese.   Everything about this was heaven in my mouth.  It was moist-- almost like they steam baked it in the oven.   The eggs had a fluffy quality to them and everything else just melded together beautifully.  I ate *all* of this with no regrets.  Paired it with some coffee and I was a happy girl.

I picked up a cinnamon roll to go for some friends so I could drop it off to their offices on Maiden Lane.   From what I hear, this was excellent as well.  

Special shout out to Jose and Dora for taking care of us this past Monday.  If you haven&apos;t been here before, suck it up and wait in line if you have to.  It&apos;s worth it.  

Or maybe you&apos;ll get lucky like I did and have zero wait time."
5,Ok I came here after clusterfest and omg. Y&apos;all everything was so good. I had an omelette with GOAT CHEESE!!! The pastries are SENSATIONAL! I had this peach cobbler thing I can&apos;t even remember what it was called but Jesus man. I gotta back immediately for my mental health
2,I&apos;m giving this place 2 stars because they workers were really nice and attentive. The food is really expensive. 1 pancake is $6.50! For this price I expected to see stars and rainbows lol but honestly I can get better tasting pancakes at ihop. The potatoes where super dry! Also my sons water had a fly. I understand maybe with the pandemic their menu is limited but whoa.
