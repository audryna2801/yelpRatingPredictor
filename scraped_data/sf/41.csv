5,"This is my absolute favorite ice cream spot. I&apos;d marry this place if it were a person. My favorite thing about my favorite spot is that there are 3 different matcha green tea flavors: The Matcha Gold (Toffee), Hojicha (Roasted Matcha), &amp; Genmaicha (Matcha Toasted Rice). I&apos;ve tried all 3 &amp; they&apos;re all very delicious!

Quality/ Food:
They have so many great unique flavors. This includes the different matcha flavors, Black Sesame, Chocolate Brownie, Mango Sticky Rice, Thai Tea, Hazelnut Crunch, &amp; more. The quality is top notch! It tastes fresh, handmade, &amp; yummyyyyy. 

Service:
The owner is so nice! All the workers are very accommodating as well. Pre-COVID, you were able to try as many flavors as you&apos;d like &amp; they were so patient about it. 

Now:
Fair warning, my review is more so before the pandemic. With the pandemic going on, things are different now &amp; they don&apos;t have as many flavors as they once had. I&apos;ll still go back though. Once the pandemic is over (I know I know, it&apos;ll be awhile), I&apos;ll definitely be going back all the time! Oh how I miss this place."
5,"I&apos;ve been trying to order from this place for 3 weeks now and I was finally able to place an order!

This place sells out in a matter of minutes every week. And after trying their ice cream I definitely understand why!

Due to COVID they are only accepting online pre-orders that are open every Thursday at 7pm. And from my experience they have been selling out within 5 minutes.

I ordered a pint of the Pineapple Island Jam and it was sooooooo gooooood! It was creamy, not too sweet, and the jam and pineapple flavors blended together perfectly!

I think that its awesome that they sell out every week! Their ice cream is unique and delicious and they deserve all the attention that they&apos;re getting.

Pick up window is from 12pm-6pm every Saturday

Service was really friendly and efficient! Picking up was super easy and whole process only took a minute. 

I picked up my order around 4:45pm and surprisingly I found street parking fairly easily!

I am crossing my fingers hoping that I am lucky enough to be able to order their other flavors before they sell out again haha"
5,"This place has been on my radar for awhile, been difficult to get an order with flavors I thought I may like, but I was able to cop 3 flavors and each one was better then I expected. 

Due to covid the new option is to pre-order, we are close to 11 months with covid so things have surprisingly have not opened up yet haha. I was looking for a specific flavor that was offered early in the year last year, the white rabbit yes the asian candy in ice cream form, I use to take packs of and finish in a day... probably why I am now diabetic buwhahaha 

so here is what we sampled and how each faired with me and the kids

pandan coconut - color is a light green, creamy, flavorful, more pandan flavored then coconut which I was ecstatic about, definitely order this

Vanilla and Honolulu Company Cookies - literally chunks of Honolulu Company Cookies embedded with the vanilla, if you have never hand the cookies, this would be a perfect introduction to them, definitely order this

Vanilla Brownie - I personally am not a fan of brownies but my kids are, sampled there choice and got to say it may have changed my mind to trying more brownies haha, I would order this again

Still on the hunt for the white rabbit, I was told by staff it should be available during Chinese New Year so in February keep an eye out, cop these flavors quick they sell out fast

ice cream ***** wow
price $$
service ***** very helpful staff
ambiance ? did not get to venture inside due to covid I will have to come back  when covid dies off haha"
4,"Great tasting homemade ice cream!!!! Their flavors are so true to what you expect!!! They do change their flavors weekly but favs do come back! Currently they&apos;re doing pre-orders only and they go on sale at 7pm on their website. If you want a specific flavor get ready at 6:59 and ready to work and move REALLY FAST because flavors sell out quick!!!

I have so many fav flavors and it&apos;s hard to pick!!! But just know that what you expect the ice cream to taste like is what you&apos;re going to get!!! The staff is also really friendly and will always answer questions!"
5,"If I could order a pint everyday I would! This spot has always been in my bookmarks. I&apos;ve never visited pre-covid days, but now i&apos;m totally regretting it! Making a trip to the city to pick up my pints will NEVER be a hassle. Yes. It&apos;s totally worth it.

Due to COVID related restrictions, they are currently accepting pre-orders online. Thursday&apos;s are the days I look forward to--which is the day their online store is live (may vary from week-to-week). For updates, you may want to follow their Instagram page. Their IG page includes the latest news and updates. Pick up dates are every Saturday &amp; Sunday with specific pick up hours.

Okay... So, I DID NOT expect them to sell out literally in less than 5 minutes after going live. Mind you this was my first time ordering, so I was taking my time reading the ingredients and debating if I should &quot;get that flavor&quot; or not. Dude... my only advice is, do the homework the day before (they usually post flavors of the week on IG), once it hits 7PM on Thursday, RUN! Hit that refresh button, put it in the cart, and be patient up until pick up day LOL. 

Their ice cream consistency isn&apos;t your normal &quot;grocery store&quot; bought type. My biggest purchase included all of their Christmas/holiday flavors. I finished a whole pint of Eggnog Brandy to myself in under 30 mins... that should be your signal to &quot;line up&quot; for the upcoming Thursday they go live &amp; buy the flavors!!

Also, big thank you to the Garden Creamery family for making the time &amp; effort for keeping our sweet tooth satisfied. Come &amp; support small businesses!"
4,It&apos;s a bummer that they aren&apos;t doing scoops like almost all of the other ice cream shops.  I don&apos;t have room in my freezer for pints but I&apos;m also not about to fight to order pints online when they literally sell out in minutes.  Otherwise I love their flavor selection and you could tell from the taste that high quality ingredients go into it.  I tend to lean towards their Asian flavors and I&apos;ve never came across one that I didn&apos;t like.  I&apos;ve tried their chimney cone back in the day and I wouldn&apos;t get that again.  It was pretty thick and the cone to ice cream ratio was way off - there was too much cone and not enough ice cream.  That might have been because the chimney cone came out fresh so it was hot and it melted a lot of the ice cream.  Definitely can&apos;t wait until they go back to their normal hours and we can get cones again.
5,"This ice cream is heaven. The Mission has a lot of great ice cream, but this is my go-to spot. The flavors are amazing and unique, sweetness is perfect, and the texture and creaminess is spot on. I like the black sesame and any of the coffee or tea flavors especially. Even their dairy free ones are good (as I discovered after getting the coconut for my lactose intolerant friend)."
5,"NOT ME RAVING TO ALL OF MY FRIENDS ABOUT GARDEN CREAMERY  anyway not to be dramatic but this is my favorite ice cream place in the world. I would die for garden creamery. 

Vibes: to vibe check, they are SO inclusive!! They&apos;re incredibly culturally competent and each unique flavor has a description of where it is sourced as well as some info on the cultural origins/ inspirations of the flavor!! Additionally, there is an abundance of vegan choices for my vegan/ lactose intolerant fxlks. 

Aesthetic: The storefront? Also incredibly aesthetic on the inside and out!! I love the clean white interior that contrasts with the hot pink exterior. Also, from what I can remember in the pre-covid times, I definitely thought the bathroom was cute and took a bathroom pic. 

Flavors: oh my god the creativity is astounding. I have never had a flavor here I did not like, and I honestly have such decision paralysis when I&apos;m here because everything is so good! There are such rich flavors like ube, mango, black sesame, neopolitan, white rabbit, Tahitian vanilla for a classic, and more. Everyone there encourages you to try new flavors, and if you&apos;re someone slightly picky, don&apos;t be shy! You will probs love it. 

To end off this lengthy review about how much I love garden creamery, I literally asked for a sticker so I can paste it on my laptop and answer questions about the store when people ask thx bye!!"
5,"Excellent, high-quality ice cream with well-developed flavors, great mouthfeel, and a rich, decadent consistency!  

Garden Creamery is WHEELCHAIR-ACCESSIBLE in non-Covid-times.  Their ice cream is very popular, so there&apos;s usually a line anytime they&apos;re open...Once you&apos;ve experienced their ice cream, you&apos;ll know why!!

The flavors offer a not-your-grandparents&apos;-ice-cream intensity, with Tahitian Vanilla, Chocolate that&apos;s 55% semi-sweet, Thai Tea, Black Sesame, Japanese Milk Coffee, and so many more!  They also carry vegan flavors, so your dairy-free friends can enjoy an outing to the ice creamerie with you!  

As you&apos;ve probably seen in other reviews, they&apos;re currently doing pre-ordered pints that you order online and pick up at the store during limited weekend hours.  I&apos;m glad they&apos;ve found a way to continue to provide their delicious product to all of us enthusiastic consumers during the pandemic, and I look forward to visiting their store the &quot;regular way&quot; once it&apos;s safe to do so again!"
5,Unique and just downright amazing ice cream with incredible flavor and texture but almost more importantly is how wonderful the people behind the counter make this a truly neighborhood business my family and friends love to visit.
5,"I absolutely love Garden Creamery. I make it a point to stop by whenever I&apos;m in SF and I live in the South Bay. This quaint, unassuming ice cream shop near Mission has some great flavors and I could not recommend it more.

If you are into tea and fruity flavors, do yourself a favor and come here. Some of my personal favorites have been the pluot flavor (this is a seasonal), the black sea same, the genmaicha, orange creamsicle, and early grey.

During covid they&apos;re also doing preorders which is helpful since the shop&apos;s hours differ day to day. So make sure you check if they&apos;re open before you head over!"
5,"I&apos;ve never visited garden creamery before they started selling their pints but it&apos;s always been on my bookmarks! Getting these pints online is almost like winning the lottery! You have to get on the website exactly at 7pm and it sells out in the first few minutes. Pickup is usually pretty quick as well, you just tell them your name and they have your order ready in a minute. 

I&apos;ve been lucky enough to get the watermelon sorbet, cantaloupe , lychee, ginger pluot and Li hing pluot, I&apos;ve honestly got to say that these are some of the most flavorful ice creams I&apos;ve had. It&apos;s super creamy, rich and not too sweet. The faves have been cantaloupe, lychee watermelon and ginger pluot. The Li hing for me was a bit strong but it still has a really good flavor profile. I wish they were open for scoops again, I would totally come to try their other flavors out! 

Overall, I love this ice cream spot. I&apos;m definitely gonna be back for more pints and to also get scoops in the future! 

Total for 3 pints: $38"
5,"Absolutely blown away by the delicious ice creams made here! The cantaloupe and strawberry ume have outstanding flavor profiles. Their ice creams are very unique and seasonal. 

The cantaloupe tasted like the real deal but much better and creamier! The strawberry ume is sweet, tangy and salty. 

It&apos;s currently a heat wave with the power being turned off sporadically. It&apos;s 2 am and this bowl of scoops are the best! 

P.s all their green tea flavors kick ass too! I&apos;m a GC STAN!

When ordering online you&apos;ve gotta be QUICK! Flavors sell out in mere minutes. Literally!! Poof and they&apos;re gone!"
5,"If you&apos;re deciding whether or not to make the trip out to this part of town, it is so worth it. I might be biased because I&apos;m from Hawaii and I love ice cream, but whatever.

I heard about this place from one of my best friends and earlier that day, went to a baby shower and was definitely encouraged to go by another friend, so I WAS SOLD. My biggest regret is not coming here early enough in the year to get the nian gao flavor. Yeah, I&apos;m also Chinese.

I came at a weird time (5 PM) and the line was contained to the store, but no mistake, there was a line. However, once I read all the flavors, there was not enough line to give me enough time to make up my mind. It also did not help I was working through major nostalgia as I went through the flavors available that day. Or maybe the line was just really really fast. Here&apos;s what they had available on 2/22/2020:

ICE CREAM: Velvety Chocolate, Cookies and Cream, Black Sesame, Matcha Oreo, Jpanaese Milk Coffee (UCC Coffee ftwwww), White Rabbit, Brownies and Cream, Hoji cha (roasted matcha), Salty Kaya, Ube Pandan, Milk and Cookies (SCHOOL KINE FTW), Hong Kong Milk tea (black tea + condensed milk) 

NON DAIRY: Mango sticky rice, Thai tea, Banana Lilikoi, Coconut, Dark Chocolate, and Guava Li Hing.

I straight up sampled 3 or 4 of them and had to make a game time decision because my husband was circling the block in the car. I got a 2 scooper and a 3 scooper with the excuse that I&apos;d &quot;share with my husband&quot; (lol). I cant believe my sister didnt want any! I got the guava li hing, matcha, white rabbit, black sesame, and Japanese coffee. EVERYTHING WAS SO GOOD. 

Definitely earned top spot for best ice cream in the city. I wish they came down to South Bay because it&apos;s so good. Please come? Please?"
5,"Love this place!!! Decided to finally try this place after hearing many good things about it. Will have to find street parking nearby. The shop is quite small but super nicely decorated! I even asked for a sticker when checking out and the cashier gave me one!

I got the Azuki bean and Japanese coffee milk! Both super good! The staff was super nice and allowed many samples! They had super creative/unique flavors that I have never seen elsewhere! The Azuki bean reminded me of the red bean bars I used to eat when I was younger but in ice cream form! Super creamy and not overly sweet! The Japanese coffee milk was a light coffee flavor; super great for people who like coffee flavored foods. Would definitely come back to try more of their new flavors."
5,"Was a dessert chef in the past and made tons of ice cream, this place is delicious. They have enticing flavors, great consistency and balance. Seems like it is free of excess stabilizers or superfluous flavor enhancers."
5,"Every flavor is excellent. You cannot go wrong.

I currently have 22 pints of ice cream in my freezer (not even exaggerating), about 1/3 of which are from Garden Creamery. I love the texture (lightly chewy), and the rotating flavors are based on what fruit is in season.

They usually do pint preorders on Thursday evenings, but check their Instagram for updates on flavors and new pint drops. Preordered pint pickups are over the weekend, and the available days/times are on the site as well as in your email confirmation. You don&apos;t need to specify a time, so you just show up during their posted pickup time frames.

A few of my favorite flavors:
- Mango Sticky Rice (I&apos;m missing this pint, and Garden Creamery&apos;s is better than Cookiebar Creamery&apos;s version)
- Salty Kaya (coconut jam)
- Galia Melon (this helped me survive eating ghost pepper instant noodles, which was not the best use of this pint)
- Flavor Queen Pluot Ginger Sorbet (my mom loves this one almost as much as I do)
- Kinako (roasted soybean flour - delicious to use this one when making a matcha affogato)

I&apos;m really looking forward to visiting again for scoops on a sunny, post-COVID day... mainly because they used to offer chimney cones, and I miss those."
5,"I really love this spot! I&apos;ve actually never had a scoop from them. Only ever bought their pints during COVID. 

Keep in mind - if you want a pint, mark your calendar, set your alarm. The better flavors / more popular releases are sold out within 2 minutes. This week, Cantaloupe was the only one leftover after 20 min. 

You WILL be able to snag a pint or two if you are CHECKING OUT by 7:03 PM. My strategy is to put my high priority items in my check out, and then come back after for the pints I&apos;m only feeling so-so about. This week I snagged 2 pints of Tahitian Vanilla w/ Brownie (one for me, one for a friend) and 1 pint of the Strawberry Ume.

At home now, we have the Watermelon sorbet + Watermelon ice cream + Cantaloupe + Matcha + Li Hing Plum + Black sesame.

All in all, it&apos;s really fun buying these flavors online, a little stressful tho. But I love trying all the new and interesting fruit forward flavors. It&apos;s replaced Salt and Straw for me which is a big deal!"
5,"Garden Creamery is one of the best and most unique ice cream shops in San Francisco! Their ice cream has outstanding flavor and is so smooth and creamy! What makes them unique are their wide range of Asian flavors and how spot on the flavors are! Some of their amazing Asian-inspired flavors include Mango Sticky Rice, Ube Pandan, Matcha Oreo, Hong Kong Milk Tea, White Rabbit Candy, Black Sesame, and Nian Gao (sweet rice cake). The flavors are incredibly outstanding and better than other Asian flavored ice cream shops in the city. My favorites are the Mango Sticky Rice and Ube Pandan, which are year round staples. Some flavors are seasonal, such as the Nian Gao, which was special for Chinese New Year. In addition to the best Asian-inspired flavors, Garden Creamery also has traditional favorites, such as Cookies and Cream and Velvety Chocolate. 

Garden Creamery is located on a tiny corner down a narrow alley in the Mission District of San Francisco. Parking is VERY hard to find. After you finally find parking, there will usually be a long line to wait in that stretches out the door and around the store. Still worth it! The cost for a 2-3 scoop ice cream is $7.50, plus $1 for a waffle cone. Kids scoops are $4 and single scoops with 1-2 flavors are $5. Sugar and cake cones are free. They also have awesome toppings, including butter mochi! Toppings range from 50 cents to $3 (and you know butter mochi is the $3 one). All of the ice cream are made from scratch, mainly using local and organic ingredients. You are welcome to sample a few flavors before making your final selections. Garden Creamery is definitely a great choice if you are in the mood for some outstanding ice cream."
5,"Love this place, to the point where I almost didn&apos;t want to add a glowing 5-star review to keep it as low key as possible. 

Coming from Hawai&apos;i, I may be biased when I say this but this is the best ice cream shop in the bay area. The ice cream is so rich and creamy, the flavors are bold and absolutely impactful. I love the service and the aloha every time I walk in. Any location that uses lihing for anything, take all my money. I&apos;ve been coming here consistently before the SIP, and I sure hope they continue to pump out great ice cream through and after covid-19. 

Thanks for the lihing strawberry sorbet!"
