5,"This legendary park has definitely been one of my sanctuaries during this quarantine! I got back into biking last fall, and I&apos;ve been here at least maybe once a week or every other week! It has vast trails and routes, and differing scenery. The ride possibilities are endless! And the terrain varies between asphalt, dirt, and gravel. So whether your bike is road, gravel, or mtb, you&apos;ll find a route suitable to you. And if you bike in the surrounding areas as well, you could easily log in a ton of miles! And right now, the Great Highway is closed off from cars between Lincoln and Sloat, so it&apos;s an awesomely scenic place to bike or walk/jog. 

As with any place in SF, this place can get super crowded. I like to go really early on weekend mornings so there&apos;s not too many people around. By the time I&apos;m done with my ride, the crowds are usually trickling in. On weekdays, mid morning or early afternoon are good times. Facility wise, there are public restrooms all over the park. There are food carts and food trucks as well. Depending when you go, you should be able to find street parking somewhere. But just remember, don&apos;t leave anything visible in your car!"
5,"Just making it to the end of 2020 was worth celebrating! I celebrated by taking a stroll through San Francisco&apos;s Golden Gate Park (GGP) on New Year&apos;s Eve (December 31, 2020). In fact, 2020 marked the 150th birthday of Golden Gate Park!

And - what a gorgeous park! I couldn&apos;t have asked for better weather either on New Year&apos;s Eve. High 50s, sunny and clear. As I walked through the park. I felt like a kid in a candy store. I still can&apos;t believe I had never been to this magical place before especially since I&apos;ve been to SF so many times! So much to do. So much to see. So much to explore + experience! I cannot wait to come back! Anyone up for a GGP adventure? :)

GGP provides a warm and welcome escape from urban SF life. With 1000 beautiful acres (it&apos;s actually bigger than NYC&apos;s Central Park), GGP has everything from hiking trails, playgrounds and open spaces, to biking, museums, recreation, and amazing groves and Japanese tea gardens. There is something for everyone. It was so inspiring to see people walking, jogging, running, cycling and even picnic&apos;ing. Side note: I have a strong feeling one of the frogs in the Lily pond is my Prince Charming ;)

GGP is located in the western part of San Francisco in the shape of a rectangle, and is over 3 miles in length and 1/2 mile in width. It is bordered by the Haight-Ashbury, Richmond, and Sunset neighborhoods, as well as Ocean Beach. Parking is on the street. I got lucky and found metered parking. I can only assume parking is difficult on weekends or for events.

Due to COVID, masks are required throughout the park. I was actually surprised that San Franciscans wear masks outside - that&apos;s probably a big reason why the city of SF has been able to contain the virus better than many other metropolitan cities. Plus, people will give you dirty looks if you don&apos;t wear a mask! LOL. Trust me, I&apos;m not a fan of wearing masks, but I wear one to be considerate. 

There&apos;s no fee to enter and enjoy the park. It&apos;s free however many of the individual attractions such as the museums and gardens do charge admission fees. For admission prices and hours, visit https://goldengatepark.com/golden-gate-park-admission-prices-hours.html 

If you are planning a visit to San Francisco, I highly recommend adding GGP to your itinerary."
5,"Golden Gate Park is a San Francisco icon, celebrating its 150th anniversary this year. William Hammond Hall, California&apos;s first state engineer, was charged with taking 1,000 acres of mostly sandy soil and turning it into a into a public park that would do for San Francisco what Central Park did for New York City.

The temporary 150-foot anniversary Ferris Wheel opened just a few days before we arrived in late October. It had been idled since it appeared in April, because of the coronavirus pandemic, so it was nice to get to see the city from up high.

We visited the Japanese Tea Garden and the San Francisco Botanical Garden. Because of our membership in the Idaho Botanical Garden, we did not have to pay an entrance fee to either garden. They were both spectacular."
5,"(NOTE: My family has a long-standing rivalry with the Olmstead family, but I won&apos;t allow that to influence my review.)

This is a great park! You can find any activity that your heart, brain, lungs, or any other internal organ desires. I have only one question/concern: is it against the rules to drink alcohol in the park? I see people drinking alcohol quite frequently (usually beer or wine), and the policy seems to mostly be &quot;No harm not foul,&quot; but I would like to know the offical rules.

I used to come here for the Hardly Stricly Bluegrass Festival and we would listen to the music and drink Schlitz cocktails (a can of Schlitz with whipped cream and a cherry on top)."
4,"This beautiful and breath taking park is more than 3 miles in length and will most likely take 5-6 hrs to pace through just the majority of it, especially if you find yourself caught up inside museums.

Parking was fairly easy for us on a Monday morning. We parked along Nancy Pelosi Dr. Â (Free Street Parking)

We decided to explore the Japanese Tea Garden. I&apos;m not sure where folks are getting their $3-8 dollar entrance from, let alone free entry on Mondays, but when we went on a Monday, it was $9 per person at 10:30 am. Just thought I&apos;d note that.

It was very pretty, filled with Japanese influenced architecture, artifacts, and plants indigenous to (or at the very least associated with) Japan. Cherry blossoms, bonsai-looking trees, koi fish etc.

We also ventured over to the Rose garden (Free) next door and found nothing to be in bloom unfortunately.

We then took a stroll to Stow Lake where we saw some herons, ducks, and turtles in the lake.

We revisited the park later on in the day around 6 pm to watch the sunset by Ocean beach, by the Dutch Windmill and Tulip garden (also free) and was blessed with ample parking and a gorgeous view.

We also did a quick drive to Bison Paddock but they were hiding in the back. :( Overall a great experience and I&apos;d come back to do the remaining half of the park!"
4,"Lovely greenery in the midst of the city. Fun for all. Parking is not a problem. See below for more deets: 

Lovely greenery in the midst of the city: 
Golden Gate Park is lovely greenery in the midst of the city (or Karl the Fog for us San Franciscans). GGP is our greenery equivalent of Central Park to New Yorkers as one can step away from the hustle and bustle of the city to relax and enjoy life! 

Fun for all: 
GGP is fun for all!  I have been visiting the park since my childhood and have many fond memories from my elementary school days in the playgrounds to my high school days running cross country races in the Polo Fields and my current days walking the perimeter with the partner. There are many activities to do here. Running is a favorite for many as the park is massive and pleasant for a long run or some sprints. Many opt to take long strolls solo, loved ones, or furry friends. Others enjoy picnics or sitting/tanning/relaxing in the greenery. Many choose to bike around the perimeter or drive. There is the De Young Museum for art lovers, Cal Academy for people who enjoy science or penguins, Japanese Tea Garden for learning more about culture, and Botanical Garden for those who enjoy flowers. All of these cost additionally, but there are free days in the year for SF residents. 

Parking is not a problem: 
GGP is massive and so parking is not a problem here. On top of easily finding a spot for your car, parking is free. The activity we are doing dictates where we park from the lower avenues when we go to Cal Academy to closer to beach when running the perimeter."
5,"I love this park! When I first found out about this park, I wasn&apos;t that amazed by it, BUT then I found specific areas located here. This park has 2 museums, picnic areas, playgrounds, lakes, mini hikes, Japanese Tea Garden, Botonical Garden, running track, and MANY MORE! There&apos;s a lot of different activities to do for all ages here and I always see people having picnics here too.

My favorite areas in this park is Strawberry Hill, Stow Lake, Japanese Tea Garden, and the museum area. I like bringing my friends and walking my dog at this park because it&apos;s usually not too crowded and there&apos;s a lot of nice things to look at. Most of the activities here are free too, so it&apos;s very budget friendly.

I&apos;d recommend this park! There&apos;s something for everyone here and you can get a nice view of the city depending on what area of the park you&apos;re at!"
5,"This park is amazing and beyond fun.  It&apos;s the highlight of time we spend in San Francisco.  I went here thinking of Balboa Park in San Diego and was shocked to discover how diverse and interesting this park is.  I think it&apos;s pup&apos;s 2nd fav. 

We go to the buffalo, the fly fishing area, museums, Shakespeare&apos;s garden, stow lake, and the windmill.  This is the first place we went since shelter in place was lifted.  I will never take spending time in the park with my pup for granted again."
5,Strolling through the park I see trees in yellow and orange! This our Fall Season foliage! Take a stroll to see the greenery live in person. Early morning is best when there are not many people!
5,"Between picking up frozen dumplings in Richmond and a dinner reservation in downtown, we stopped at a random stop in Golden Gate Park to go on a walk with our son.  It reminded me what a lovey park this is.  There were people here, but all groups were spaced out well.  We left saying we need to come back soon!"
5,"I find it endlessly amusing that you can review Golden Gate Park, and even more so that it would receive anything but a 5-star. Really, it should have many more stars because it is a truly spectacular thing.

I&apos;ve been fortunate to have Golden Gate Park within a reasonable walking distance for many years, but have moved even closer more recently. The amount of beauty and splendor to be found within is endless. Whether you&apos;re on foot or bicycle, GGP is the gift that keeps on giving.

Some of my favorite activities: runs/bike rides through the car-free sections, the DeYoung, Spreckels lake, the bison, stow lake, etc. etc. etc.

And for its 150th anniversary, they currently have the Skywheel. Make a reservation and check it out before it&apos;s gone."
5,"Like the Class of 2020 Graduates, Golden Gate Park got royally screwed by the systemic shutdown of society caused by a declared p-p-p-pan...I can&apos;t say it any more.  I&apos;m over it, but it still ain&apos;t over.  This was supposed to be the big 150th anniversary celebration of this amazingly diverse, 1000-acre-plus swath of beauty in the middle of mayhem.  Instead, the museums and pay-to-view gardens are closed, concerts cancelled, special events postponed.  Still Golden Gate Park has much to offer in these times and on Memorial Day weekend we packed a picnic and made a day of it.

Golden Gate Park would be a marvel in any context, but given that it is in  one of the most densely populated cities on the planet and still somehow manages to absorb the daily masses who come seeking escape, giving each their own little piece to enjoy is utterly fantastic.

There are so many walking, hiking and biking trails.  Numerous clearings, groves and meadows suitable for recreational activities, meditation or picnicking.  When I lived in the City I came here frequently and still don&apos;t know all of it and depending on the season even the old places can offer new experiences.

On the minus side, just like the City it lives in, parking here can be hard to come by and traffic getting in, through and out can occasionally be frustrating.  There&apos;s something odd about fighting humanity in this way to step into nature for a few minutes, but I suppose it does validate the importance of having it here.  Also it can attract some unsavory characters, some just being their vulgar selves, some there to prey on the weak, so be careful, and don&apos;t venture in after dark.  It&apos;s technically a 24 hour spot, but &quot;Golden Gate After Dark&quot; is probably an whole other review which I won&apos;t be writing."
5,"I love going to Golden Gate Park!!

First off, this park is huge!! And there&apos;s just so much to do here!  You got Museums, Lakes, Windmills, Japanese Gardens, Waterfalls, Conservatory Of Flowers, Strawberry Hill, multiple small parks and hidden trails throughout and at the end is Ocean Beach!!

It&apos;s easy to spend all day here, even multiple days, which is probably even better.  I&apos;ve ran a lot of races all through this park for many years, and I&apos;ve always loved the vibe here.

I could go on and on, but in short, this is without a doubt one of the best places to go in SF!!"
5,"** The following review reflects my experience prior to the shelter-in-place order currently in effect. ** 

What can I possibly say about Golden Gate Park that hasn&apos;t been said already? My inability to answer this question probably explains why I waited until my 5,200th Yelp review to write about it. Did you know legendary landscape architect Frederick Law Olmstead was involved in the park&apos;s design as he was with Central Park and the Biltmore Estate? Golden Gate Park is actually 20% larger than Central Park, and I have to admit I had been taking it for granted most of my life. I&apos;m the shallow type that has been going repeatedly to the individual attractions in the park but didn&apos;t appreciate the whole of the park until...

Until quite recently... and ironically just before it was cut off to me due to shelter-in-place. I live beyond the mandated five-mile radius, so venturing there has not been an option now.  But I started taking the three-mile walk from Ocean Beach all the way to Stanyan with some regularity even though it was made somewhat adventuresome from the vehicular traffic. What I began noticing were all the less marketed jewels of the park like the Queen Wilhelmina Tulip Garden, Lloyd Lake with the picturesque  torrent and the Portals of the Past, the Bison Paddock, the top of Strawberry Hill in Stow Lake, and the quietude of Shakespeare&apos;s Garden and the National AIDS Memorial Grove.

As I was making my way on John F. Kennedy Drive (before they banned cars), especially between the DeYoung and the Conservatory of Flowers, it became markedly congested with joggers, scooter enthusiasts, and gaggles of particularly indifferent young couples in those last days before the shelter-in-place order. I could see why it was necessary and sad at the same time. Golden Gate Park will most assuredly come back to its former glory, though the full impact of the pandemic will be a double-edged sword. On one hand, none of us will ever think of &quot;a walk in the park&quot; the same way. On the other, once we all master that walk, it will be beautiful and nothing we can take for granted ever again.

4,"Created in 1870, today Golden Gate Park is 1,017 acres of recreational diversity. It&apos;s roughly 3 miles by a 1/2 mile wide. There is a free public transit shuttle but if you are driving try to find a parking spot near the features you are interested in. The west side is quieter and ends at a beach. There is free parking in many areas including around the circumference of the park. At the main entrance there is a map of the park, I suggest you take a picture of it for future reference. It is easy to get disorientated and end up walking away from your intended destination. Be aware that the de Young Museum is closed on Mondays. The Japanese Tea Garden is free before 10 am. There are attractions that will cost you money like California Academy of Science ($35), the de Young Museum ($10), Conservatory of Flowers ($7) Strybing Arboretum ($7). The San Francisco City Card is an option at $76 and is valid for 30 days. If you do not reside in the county, Carousel rides are ($1) and paddle boat rides at Stow Lake ($25 per/hr.). There is a 9 hole par 3 golf course ($20). There are a lot of free entertainment opportunities as well. The Windmills and tulips when they are in bloom are free. Bison paddock viewing and several lakes and children&apos;s playgrounds are free as well. They have archery, an outdoor roller rink, bike rentals are available and are a really nice way to get around the park especially on Sundays when car access is restricted.. There are designated bike lanes in the park. Spreckel&apos;s Temple of Music , Strawberry Hill Beach and Chalet, fly fishing lakes and countless tree lined hiking trails are other worthwhile activities. It&apos;s called the Central Park of the west and it is an urban triumph.

Check for COVID-19 closings since coronavirus infection rates and consequent closings of public and private venues are in constant flux."
5,"Nice park for a picnic, walking around, taking out pets and more.  There&apos;s usually plenty of parking available and lots of benches and places to sit down.  The museums and gardens are nice too.  Japanese tea garden is one of my favorites.  I stopped in the park for a picnic and it&apos;s a nice part of San Francisco that&apos;s more calm and relaxing."
4,"I can&apos;t believe this is my first time coming to the GGP and I&apos;ve lived here for hellllllla long in the East Bay!  It was truly a real tourist day for me.  Great place to catch up with friends, take a walk, gain some steps in, enjoy the scenery, take photo opts or just lounge pick a spot and have a picnic.  Parking really sucks on the weekend.  If you don&apos;t mind paying for parking there is a garage.  I was there roughly over 4 hours and paid $25.00.  The park is huge and nicely maintained.  You can easily see why there are so many people that come to just hang out.  I loved the community of colors.  People were playing freesbie, riding bikes, walking their dogs, skate boarding and just enjoying the day.  If you love to roller skate there is a location in the park where you can roller skate to jams with other enthusiasts! It was a Beautiful day at the park."
4,Great park for picnics :) Do come early though because parking can be a hassle.
5,"I would definitely come back to SF just to roam around this park a bit more. Much bigger than Central Park in NYC, there seems to be a bunch of stuff to do here. On a sunny day, I am sure you can have a quiet and peaceful picnic by yourself or with your friends and even bike around the park."
5,"I always thought Central Park was the bees knees when it came to big city parks, but not having experienced Golden Gate Park as an adult I didn&apos;t have a proper model for comparison. Golden Gate Park has a much less &quot;city&quot; feel to it. As soon as you are off the main drag you hardly feel as if you are in crowded San Francisco anymore. There are so many outside spaces for people to enjoy, pandemic or not! 

Now that I have a nephew that walks (and runs!) it is great to have a place he can go to and just be a kid running around (and evading his parents!) I was thrilled to be the first to introduce him to the world of kite-flying. There was plenty of space to get the kite up and flying to completely mesmerize the kiddo. I look forward to future visits when the state isn&apos;t back in lockdown and I can reunite with my little love bug!"
