5,"THIS REVIEW WAS FROM LAST YEAR PRE PANDEMIC (PANDEMIC NOTES IN OTHER SECTION):
I was just on a working holiday back up into the city when a friend of mine asked me my plans for the day after I was supposed to leave- it wasn&apos;t originally to go to Alcatraz but let me tell you, that immediately changed when my friend gifted me tickets to go due to unfortunate circumstances on their end.

I&apos;d been hyped about going. They were night tickets. Alacatraz has been on my radar for a long time anyway. It&apos;s a historical site, a National Park, and well, there&apos;s Chicago history connected to it as well but that doesn&apos;t come until later.

The night tour is called the Ghost Tour which is totally up this little death nerd&apos;s alley although sorry to say I didn&apos;t hear about any ghosts (nor did I really ask about any actually in hindsight) nor have any weird encounters although I totally got to go somewhere specifically that... well again that comes later.

So as hyped as I was to be going to Alcatraz by my friends good graces vs doing yoga which, well I could do yoga anytime even if it&apos;s not at [redacted] I messed up &amp; misread the ticket that said it was at pier 33 &amp; read it at pier 3 on accident. So despite high tailing an Uber to get cross town from... the Haight, we got to the wrong Pier with 15 minutes to spare before it was about to board, ate the absolute worst Mexican food in the city (see review for El Rancho Grande) only to find out... yeap it&apos;s at pier 33 &amp; not 3 &amp; the boat was gone gone gone. The office however over at Hornblower was mad chill though &amp; said that they&apos;d totally honor the tickets if we came back tomorrow.

Well, my flight was originally scheduled for that day until I changed it (thanks Delta first class-ness) &amp; the next day we were ready to go get ghosty over on the island. 

My friend that came with was prepped for the cold. It was... so nice out that day that it was pretty amazing. The view was even clear. 

All of the staff were SOO nice especially John who I still owe an email (says this little 50s dressed journalist) &amp; I have to say, it was absolutely fantastic. They had a talk about Al Capone that day because it was the anniversary of his arrival when I went last year. The cell tour before that was really great as well. I got several great pictures &amp; had several great conversations about it.

I also got to go somewhere off the tour because I&apos;m a journalist. I got a special night tour of the morgue. Pix included below with me with sherbert colored hair. It was pretty awesome. I write about death stuff sometimes. Uh did I mention it was awesome because it totally was IMHO. And it was at night so like extra rad. Night tour ftw!

PANDEMIC TOUR NOTES:
I was once again up here for work. Originally I was going to be here for Halloween but went on Dia de Los Muertos instead because, well my friends &amp; I couldn&apos;t make it there on time as we were planning on wearing costumes on our tour. Whoops. Oh well, Hornblower was once again great about allowing us to bump the tickets back a day so I could literally go to prison for work.

The tour was limited due to the pandemic. There were significantly less available time slots. Night tour wasn&apos;t an option. We got one of the later tours &amp; ended up on the last ferry back to the city at like 5 something I think.

Only the outside grounds of the prison was open. There wasn&apos;t any entry to the inside due to the pandemic which meant only walking the grounds &amp; sadly no talks like there were pre-pandemic. 

The island is still really neat to walk around on. I didn&apos;t as much of it last time even though I did end up in the morgue (which is closed off even on normal not pandemic times) because it was dark. It&apos;s a good hike! Wear comfy shoes. I&apos;m so glad I didn&apos;t end up here in heels in a costume the day before. My feet would have been very upset about it even though the costume stuff still probably needs to happen at some point eventually.

Once you are on the island you really don&apos;t have much &quot;guidance&quot; unless you approach a ranger directly. If you go to the information desk, you can listen to an audio tour (only audible on the grounds) if you want via an app but you should have your own headphones because while they will give you some they are pretty terrible. 

The day I went was very clear which made for gorgeous views of my favorite US city IMHO. It&apos;s a good walk as well to do. It will take you a few hours. Budget time even without the cell tour.

I wrote about this for Public Comment SF at length though. You can read my full pandemic review here: https://bit.ly/3kt0snJ

This was/is totally worth it in the pandemic &amp; outside of it but know that there are cautions &amp; the boat at the beginning &amp; end is really where things get clogged &amp; not so great. It might seem touristy af but uh folks should definitely go. I didn&apos;t go there when I lived there but have gone multiple times since I moved away. It&apos;s a gem of history that the city is seriously lucky to have."
5,"Absolutely amazing! Goosebumps from history and facts about this island. 
During covid-19 less crowds very organized. We took Alcatraz cruises booked online $77 for 2 people both ways. 
Everything is remaining closed beside rose garden and exhibitions. 
It was my first time in SF and I was very excited  specially after watching so many programs on discovery about this prison and escape.
It was very windy so we stayed only for hour and a half. 
They have souvenir shop with nice gifts to bring from Alcatraz!!!
Definitely will be back when time will be better."
5,I have been so excited to visit Alcatraz Island. Anyway where I can explore and truly learn about this unique place. We took a quick ferry over here and got amazing views of the city and bay from beginning to end. The island is so rich with history and is truly a museum in it&apos;s own right. It is apart of the national parks. The island&apos;s indoor facilities was closed and so we explored outside and got to check out the gardens throughout the island. It is pretty well kept and honestly such a great activity to do via COVID if you are okay riding a Ferry. I would love to come back when the indoor facilities are open at a later point. Who knows when that will be but definitely want to check it out! THe one thing....I just wish they wouldn&apos;t charge the same thing for just exploring the outside versus indoor and outdoor parts of the island. Can&apos;t wait to come back one day!
5,"To some, the name Alcatraz brings up visions of unicorns dancing on cherry-flavored rainbows. These people are unbalanced, and I highly suggest you keep your distance. To others, the name elicits memories of etching the word Mother into their forearm with a rusty razor while dancing naked to Swan Lake in a cold, lonely cell. These are generally happy go lucky people, maybe not the brightest, but a fun group of guys. To most, however, Alcatraz means selfie sticks, talking loud, wearing shorts in 42° weather. These people are the dregs of mankind, the absolute worst sentient beings known to the civilized galaxy: tourists!!

Since San Francisco has hardly any tourist activities, Alcatraz becomes a must-do simply by contrition. (What? They don&apos;t have sarcasm where you&apos;re from? We obviously won&apos;t be going out for drinks together anytime soon.) First lighthouse on West Coast, Civil War fortress, military then federal prison, and birthplace of the American Indian Red Power movement. Alcatraz has a history unsurpassed in the annals of islands in San Francisco Bay. So, it&apos;s really rather a cool and unique place to visit.

If you decide to visit (and you really should) it&apos;s best to book your tour earlier than later, otherwise you may be up the proverbial creek. Secondly, you look like an educated person: you, of course, know what Mark Twain (allegedly) said about San Francisco, right? That the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in San Francisco. Well, the ferry ride to the Rock takes 15 minutes, and can be a bit on the chilly side. But you wear shorts in 42° weather, so just disregard my twaddle.

Personally I prefer the evening tour, just adds that spooky little touch, knowing that the tempestuous spirits of Frank Morris, and brothers Clarence and John Anglin may come back to wreak vengeance on their tormentors! Well, their tormentors are most likely long since dead, but I doubt they&apos;d mind transferring all that wrath to an accommodating group of tourists!

The main attraction, or the real reason people come to the Rock, is because of the one time residence of Alphonse &quot;Al&quot; Capone, the notorious mafioso. Other famous inmates were George &quot;Machine-Gun&quot; Kelly, Alvin Karpis (the first &quot;Public Enemy #1&quot;), Arthur &quot;Doc&quot; Barker (you might know his mom, Ma Barker, more than him. What a loser! Overshadowed by mommy!), &quot;Whitey&quot; Bulger, Mickey Cohen, and Robert Stroud, the Birdman of Alcatraz.
It&apos;s quite an unique experience to be ale to peruse any prison, but especially one with such infamy. And the location makes it an even more interesting place to visit. So, ride a trolley, ascend Coit, stare at the big orange, I mean, golden bridge, eat some dim sum, try to find parking for less than $50/hour. Just make sure you allot some time for a visit to the Rock. Who knows, you may some day live in such a facility. Probably for wearing shorts in 42° weather"
4,"This review is a month late...

Knowing the buildings were closed due to covid before we booked the trip didn&apos;t prevent us from going. 

For a person who doesn&apos;t exercise, this was a great way to do it!  Lots of hills and more ground to cover than you&apos;d think. 

The Indian Exhibit was open...which is strange because you&apos;re think the prison cells would be too?

The grounds are hauntingly beautiful and we can&apos;t wait to come back when we can tour the prison cells."
5,"I have visited Alcatraz on two different occasions. I have done the normal day tour and the night time tour! I would highly recommend them both! They each offered such unique experiences and adventures once on the island.  

The boat ride over has some amazing views of the city.  I would recommend taking time to enjoy the talks that park rangers give as you walk up to the main jail house and within the jail house. 

Make sure you book in advance since reservations fill up quickly! If you love extra spooky adventures then take the night time tour"
5,This is by far one of the coolest experiences I&apos;ve ever had in my life. There&apos;s a lot of history there and I like history and I like seeing all the different prisons and sceneries and knowledge and stuff that&apos;s come through this place. When we visited we took a boat over to the island walk around got to be our own guided tour and we can catch different boats back to the city when we were done it was awesome to see the prison and walk around and just see everything and how it went. Part of the tour they give you headphones and you get to walk around and they tell you where to go and it&apos;s just awesome to see definitely definitely have to go to this place if you&apos;re visiting San Francisco
5,"I LOVE Alcatraz!  My mom and I flew up to the Bay Area and went to Alcatraz while we were in San Francisco.  I would recommend this place to every one.  I love crime history, so I was truly obsessed with this place.  It is also cool to see the Oakland Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge.  Me personally, this place is a top 10 attraction of the whole United States.  My mom loved it here too!"
5,One of the most infamous sites in San Francisco. I have done this tour so much &amp; every time it is haunting. It always seems lonely &amp; leaves me wondering about the stories that have taken place here.
5,"Pros:
Regardless of the weather it&apos;s worth it
Incredible learning experience

Cons:
Only 1.  At the time I went they were doing work on the cell house so it was off limits.

This is a must.
Alcatraz:  it was a sunny blue sky morning when I got there.  When I left a few hours later it was rainy and overcast.  I loved it.  
They&apos;ve done a remarkable job making it so you can pretty much explore the whole island, except for a few spots.  The cell house is where I really wanted to explore but they&apos;re working on it.   

In the yard I experienced a lot of eerie sensations.  At least that&apos;s what I felt.  I took a ton of photos.  While walking around the yard my phone came out of my back pocket, fell face down opened up, and the $20 bill I had in a tight spot came out and blew away with the wind.  It was too weird to call an accident.  

There is so much to explore.  One part I was unaware of is the exhibit about the 1969 Occupation of Alcatraz. There&apos;s a lot to learn from walking through the gigantic exhibit that is in the New Industries Building.

I had heard about the Occupation but never knew anything about it.  Seeing the photos, reading the stories, the timeline of events, how it happened, why it happened...it was a memorable learning experience.  So much so I&apos;ve been researching, reading, and learning more about it at home.

Overall, this is a must see.  So much has happened at Alcatraz.  What I love most was the amount of learning this island has to offer.  All those involved in keeping Alcatraz safe, and operating the exhibit, and everything else have done a wonderful job.

And with that I say Thank you.  I enjoyed my ride to and from, and the Island itself."
5,"WOW - this was my first .... and NOT my last.
My gf and I did an impromptu get away to frisco, I had never been to alcatraz and saw that the outside grounds remained open during COVID.
WHAT A TRIP, first off - no one was there... it was basically 20 people on the island. I felt that I saw a lot of stuff including the prison yard (and took a pic all alone in it) that was still available for viewing even though there were lots of limits due to COVID.

Can not wait to be back when COVID is over to see the inside of the jail!!

boat ride for 2 was like 70$ (included walking the island)."
5,"I went to Alcatraz 10+ years ago with my family, and remember it being one of the best tours we&apos;ve ever taken - and one that we still talk about among ourselves. When I booked a business trip to San Francisco and found out that my husband could join me for the weekend prior, Alcatraz was at the top of my list for places I wanted to visit with him. 

There are always those post-booking nerves though where you hope that the memory lives up to your current experience -- also, book ahead of time online so that you can make sure tickets do not sell out. When we booked (a month and a half in advance, 130 tickets were available, but day of, and for the time slot we selected, they were sold out the week prior). 

Alcatraz more than exceeded expectations - from the promptness of the ferry, and soaking in the views as you travel to the island, to the new exhibits that opened up that speak to the Native occupation of the island and back history, to the amazing audio tour of the actual facility with narration by old guards and prisoners, you are immersed in the history of the island. 

This may be a touristy thing to do, but it&apos;s one with a huge ROI. There are a lot of hills and the pavement is uneven in certain spots, so be advised in case of any mobility issues. The headsets are available in a TON of languages, as well as brochures/maps out side of the first stop of the ferry, so they&apos;re really inclusive of everyone. There is also a tram car that will take people up the hills, but the space is limited.

All in all, this lived up to my memories, and I cannot recommend it more highly. It would definitely be a return visit during future trips to San Francisco!"
4,"Awesome ferry ride to this iconic Rock! I have been in the Bay Area for over 5 years now &amp; finally had time to make it here, with limited options during shelter-in-place.

We made reservations for the exclusive night tour but COVID unfortunately threw a wrench in these plans. Alcatraz at least refunded the portion to allow us to still attend their daytime tour &amp; experience it with rare warm, weather without any fog!

It was crazy to see just how close the city &amp; everything else looks from there - along with a full panoramic view of the Bay Bridge as well as the Golden Gate Bridge.

Will have to check this out again when they allow for the Night tours again."
5,"OK... I know Alcatraz is a super touristy thing to do, but I loved it. 

I&apos;ve wanted to visit Alcatraz ever since my elementary school gym teacher used to set up a yearly &quot;escape from Alcatraz&quot; obstacle course. Surprisingly, the real thing lived up to my childhood expectations. 

We got tickets for a Sunday morning visit, which I bought online about a week in advance. I think it would be so cool to visit at night, but those tickets were sold out when I booked. Make sure you book in advance to ensure your spot. We got lucky and the weather that Sunday morning was beautiful, which made the 15-20 minute ferry ride to the island really enjoyable. We got some amazing views of the SF skyline along with our tour.  

Alcatraz is eerie and historic. It housed some of the most notorious criminals of it&apos;s time, such as Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly. Once you arrive, there is a quick welcome and then you can go collect your free audio guide, which I highly recommend using, otherwise you won&apos;t get much out of the visit. I thought the guide was very well-recorded. They use ex-prisoners to tell the stories and give the tour so it keeps things interesting. The way the tour is guided gives you a real look at what life was like for these prisoners and you can still feel the melancholy in the building itself.

The whole cruise and tour took about 2-3 hours, and since we booked it for the morning, we still had the rest of the day to hang out around SF. You can stay as long as you want and even visit the bird sanctuary they have on the island if you&apos;re into that. I would highly recommend making the trip if you have the time. It was well worth the time and $35 per person. I&apos;ll be back for a night cruise next time!"
5,"Visited the island for second time prior to COVID-19.  We really focused on spending quality time on the tour listening to the head sets.  Takes about 1 1/2 hours to get through the tour and gift shop.  Lots of great pics of the city on a beautiful day. 
Bucket List .... check"
5,"We prepared this trip months in advance, believe it or not tickets to Alcatraz do sell out. Trying to find parking around Pier 33 can also be quite a hassle. Since it rained on us this particular Saturday it wasn&apos;t too crowded but it was still a busy morning. Make sure to come prepared for the weather. You are allowed umbrellas if it rains. Boarding takes place 30mins before departure, so give yourself plenty of time.

It&apos;s a self guided tour, once you get there they let you know where to go. If you have trouble walking up the hills they do have a cart that can drive you up there. Once you enter the main prison and go around the showers there are people to hand you the audio headsets and send you on your way. It&apos;s a very informative tour.

We&apos;ve made several trips to Alcatraz, and as a matter of fact we&apos;ve brought two of these girls  when they were 6 and 7 years old. To be honest, they cared nothing for the place lol!! Well fast forward 11 years later and an additional sibling lol they decided they wanted to do a return visit. They loved the self guided audio tour so much that the older one&apos;s left us behind lol. By the time we got to the yard it stopped raining but it was windy so we let them run wild lol. We were able to see a nice rainbow and a very cloudy view of San Francisco! Definitely a tour to do in Frisco."
5,"I&apos;ve been here twice- once when I was in 7th grade with my family and another time just recently. Each time was a memorable experience. I didn&apos;t get to see the agave trail before, but my recent visit was well worth the wait. The view from the small trail is quite breathtaking- it looks like something straight from a movie! 
Please be careful though, the stairs are very steep and unforgiving, which is probably why it&apos;s closed off so often.
The prison itself offers swanky little audio tours, which I opted out of this time, but they are quite informative and give great detail about the rich history of the island and past inhabitants. They also show short films about this as well.
The cruise to the island is short- about 15 minutes- and that&apos;s lucky for me, because the SF waters can get quite  turbulent, and more so for sensitive people. I definitely recommend Dramamine beforehand."
4,"Came here during a trip to San Fran. Make sure you order your tickets online as far in advance as you can to ensure a day and time that is good for your visit. You can also pre-order snacks, drinks and photos, if that was your preference. The price was around $40 for the day tour and a bit more for the evening tour, which is limited. 

We arrived at pier 33, where the Hornblower ship docks, about 20 minutes before our cruise departed. As we boarded, you could choose to come inside and sit near a window or outside on the top deck to observe from that viewpoint. There were staff encouraging folks to take pictures against a green screen, which was Alcatraz Island.The ride was about 20 minutes and depending on the weather, may get bumpy. We disembarked on the island and were lead to a podium where one of the island&apos;s park officials, as this is a government national park, proceeded to give a short presentation on Alcatraz. There was a guide that was available in multiple languages for $1 via the honor pay system. 

Another tip, make sure you wear comfortable, sturdy shoes during your visit as their are steep inclines and rocky foot trails around Alcatraz. Also, bring a drink and snacks as there is no place to purchase them on the island. We always do the audio tour, which is included in the visit&apos;s cost. You are given earphones and a small audio player. The voices of the tour are provided by former inmates and staff of Alcatraz. It is a must for you to immerse in the true experience of Alcatraz. You can pause the tour if you want to check out points in the tour a little more and resume at your pace. This tour, depending on your walking pace and need to stop to explore the various tour points in depth, would be about 2-3 hours, but the earlier your tour is scheduled, the longer you have to explore the island.

This made my 4th trip here and I always manage to find something new, like I didn&apos;t know the cells that face towards San Fran Bay were considered the &quot;good cells&quot; because of the views of San Fran, but during New Years Eve, there used to be a yacht club on the bay by San Fran and the inmates could hear the fun and good cheer during that evening. Fascinating.
At the conclusion of the tour, you enter the gift shop, which sells all things Alcatraz.

Departing times from the island are listed and you choose which one, wait in the line, and take the ship back to pier 33. On board, they have a snack bar with water, soft drinks and snacks for purchase.

I suggest putting this on your list of things to do in San Fran. You won&apos;t be disappointed."
5,"I&apos;ve lived in the Bay my whole dang life and never been to Alcatraz. My family was gifted a San Francisco fun pack which meant that we got to go to Alcatraz and you know I was going to take advantage of those free tickets. 

Of course, Alcatraz is a huge tourist attraction so it is pretty crowded in the pier area where you board the boat over to the island. That said, if you have your ticket in advanced, it really isn&apos;t an issue and get there half an hour early, and you stand in line until your time slot opens up and the boarding process is simple. 

Once you&apos;re on the boat, you take your tourist photo and find a seat. There&apos;s a snack bar on board the ship, because there is no place to buy snacks once you get to the island. I will note that by the time we got back on the boat to come home, the toilets were all clogged and... you could tell. Yikes. 

Alcatraz itself was lovely. It is so well maintained, and despite how busy it is, it is set up so nicely that there is a good flow and it&apos;s not too crowded in any one place. The audio tour is informative, and engaging and not too long. Even the 7 year old with us was able to make it through the whole thing. 

I was shocked at the natural beauty of the island. I shouldn&apos;t be, since it&apos;s a National Park Service area but it was amazing. I jokingly said it would be a beautiful place for a wedding (it isn&apos;t, because it&apos;s not allowed and it would probably be inappropriate, but that&apos;s how gorgeous it is). It has such an amazing history and it&apos;s definitely worth the price of admission. Everyone should go!"
5,"The rock...literally it is. Its about a 15 minutes cruise away from pier 33. The only way to get there is by the boat. Make sure you take the Alcatraz Cruise out of Pier 33. There are others that say go there but they dont dock there they cruise by it....the boat trip runs about $35. I do suggest to book and buy your cruise tickets prior to travelling to San Francisco as the book up on advance quickly.

Suggest riding on the top deck, great views of the Alcatraz and San Francisco Bay and shore line. Get in line early so you can get a good upper deck seat. It can get cool, damp and windy. So be prepared and wear good walking shoes.

The tour of the rock is free! Take the free tour with the National Park Ranger.  Ranger John actually worked there as a corrections officer when it was a federal prison.  He also swam the waters to shore, interesting story and he has many. 

After the NPS Ranger tour. Go inside for your self guided tour with audio headsets.  Very easy to follow.  It&apos;s an amazing place. This island has so much history. Civil war Fortress with 20&quot; cannons, first lighthouse of the bay, military prison and federal prison. And along the way an Indian movement took place here.

You can tour and hike the whole island if you&apos;re in good enough shape. Allow at least three hours on the island to take it all in. All I can say is you&apos;ll be amazed. This is well worth your time!"
