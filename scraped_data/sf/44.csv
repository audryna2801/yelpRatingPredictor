5,"The quality and flavor of their products paired with their stellar customer service is worth paying a premium for.  Yes, the cookies are small for the price you&apos;re paying, but look at what you&apos;re paying for: you&apos;re paying for quality, you&apos;re supporting a small, local business, you&apos;re paying for consistency.  This is why I continue to be a customer and I&apos;m so happy they are still open during this pandemic. 

My favorite cookie is their cookies and cream flavor. I love the texture and the taste of their cookies. The cookies aren&apos;t dissolve-when-you-bite them soft, but they&apos;re not rock hard, either. They&apos;re always consistent and customer service is always nice. Parking can be challenging because it&apos;s SF. They enforce physical distancing. They were very nice and accommodating for me when I asked for a sticker to give to my nephew. Thanks Anthony&apos;s Cookies!!"
5,"Yuh&apos;ummm. Anthony&apos;s cookies are delicious. A few years ago, an assorted box of cookies was bought to my office and they were definitely memorable cookies. I never had an opportunity to actually stop by the store until recently--reasons being is that the shop is far from where I worked and they would sell out by the time I got off work (5:30-6pm).

I took me 3 tries for me to finally get my hands on their cookies again. I had a half day at work so I went straight to Anthony&apos;s around 2pm on a Saturday to ensure I would get at least something. At present Covid times, they only allow one customer in the shop at a time. Outside they have the menu with a check mark on the cookie flavors they have left. I was able to get the popular flavaflavs Cookies n Creme and the Toffee Chip. Dark Chocolate was my third choice. I also ordered a toffee chip ice cream sandwich to treat myself after a long work week.

Though the cookies are a bit expensive, I&apos;d say it&apos;s worth the splurge. The cookies are small but mighty with a crispy exterior and chewy interior packed with a lot of love and flavor. The toffee chip ice cream sandwich was soooo delicious! The vanilla bean ice cream paired with the cookie was the best combination ever! I get why it&apos;s the most popular flavor. It&apos;s the best ice cream sandwich experience I&apos;ve ever had. Uggh I want one right now!

I waited about 5 mins before I was able to go in and order. A line of 5 or 6 people formed when I left so I&apos;m lucky I went at a good time lol. It&apos;s best to always go early to ensure you have first dibs of all the flavaflavs. The shop is located in the Mission district next to a optometrist. There&apos;s plenty of street parking and this place is also very bartable (about a 5-6 min sketchy walk from 24th Street). Show they some love!"
5,"Once again, made another visit to pick up the BEST cookies I&apos;ve ever had!  I live in the peninsula, but it&apos;s always worth the drive.  I purchased a box (18 cookies) a couple weeks ago to be enjoyed by family during the super bowl...I was thinking that I&apos;d have a few left over to take home...NOT!!  They were all gone by end of evening.  Anthony&apos;s staff is always friendly and welcoming.  Thanks Anthony...great job as usual!"
5,"Anthony&apos;s Cookies are now my favorite cookies. Unbeatable.

We were craving cookies, so I thought I&apos;d show my boyfriend a local favorite. To my dismay, the COOKIES AND CREAM was sold out by the time we got there (1PM?).

Periodic Flavors We Were Hoping to Get:
+ Double Dark Chocolate - not available 
+ Dark Chocolate Chip - available - 5/5

Regular Flavors:
+ Cookies and Cream - sold out - 5/5
+ Classic Chocolate Chip - available - 5/5
+ Toffee Chip - available - 5/5

Seeing as how the Dark Chocolate Chip was sweet enough for me, I&apos;m glad the Double Dark Chocolate was not available. Dark Chocolate Chip was soooo good, I ate my two cookies before we made it halfway to the Outer Sunset. 

Cookies and Cream was sold out, but I&apos;ve had it before and it is just as good as the Dark Chocolate Chip if not better.

Toffee Chip was for my boyfriend. He loved it and would definitely get that again. He did, however, feel like the cookies were small, overpriced, and not the most amazing. He thought they were too crunchy, while I thought they had the perfect slight crunch on the outside and a soft inside.

He feels cookies require less skill than cupcakes, cakes, and macarons. Therefore, Sprinkles, Schubert&apos;s, and Chantal&apos;s Macarons justifiably charge an arm and leg, but not Anthony&apos;s.

I argued local favorites are able to charge an arm and leg because they&apos;re the most delicious. Competition!

Will be back. Down to 1 cookie at the moment."
4,"I went from always wanting to try Anthony&apos;s Cookies to getting the opportunity to try almost every flavor overnight. The cookie gods bestowed a dozen on us today so obviously I had to help myself to a freshly delivered toffee chip. Yum!

These cookies are the PERFECT ratio of crispy edge to chewy centers. They reheat wonderfully to really hit the spot with some milk or coffee. I love that they aren&apos;t too sweet but I will say that at $2.25 a pop, they aren&apos;t very large. Some varieties are a little bigger than others but it&apos;s not a lot of cookie for the price.

So far of the 3 that I&apos;ve tried, walnut chocolate is my favorite followed by toffee chip then cookies and creme.

All in all, it&apos;s a cookie experience you owe yourself trying at least once!"
5,"Went to Anthony&apos;s and picked up a dozen cookies... got their classic chocolate chip, dark chocolate chip, cookies and cream, toffee chip, and walnut chocolate chip. The young lady who helped me at the counter was really friendly and nice and the shop is cute. 

All the cookies are so, so good! You can really taste the butter and high quality ingredients used. Each cookie was crisp on the edges and chewy in the middle, just the way I like my cookies! Because of the cost, though, ($2.25 each!!), this will have to be a once in a long while treat."
3,"COVID-19 Review.  One of my &quot;yelp&quot; friends either checked in or posted a review from Anthony&apos;s years ago and I just happened to have seen that on that day and I love a good cookie so I bookmarked it.

This summer as we did a road trip around the Western US, we stopped in as we were in San Fransisco and quite honestly, I wasn&apos;t as excited as I wanted to be.  My wife and I came across what I think is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe ever and now it&apos;s our plum line when eating cookies.  

Anthony&apos;s wasn&apos;t bad so please don&apos;t read the 3 stars that way.  I enjoyed the various cookies we tried from there, but I wouldn&apos;t give them 5 or even 4 stars.

Great flavor and texture, but not as good as the cookies I make myself, so if I&apos;m going to pay for cookies... they need to be exceptional so I&apos;m wondering how on earth I could even find a recipe similar to them."
5,"Cookie Monster&apos;s heaven. We ate the cookies so quickly that there are no pictures to evidence this...

What we tried and what I definitely recommend:
- COOKIES AND CREAM - crisp, soft, oreo-y, sweet; all the amazing goodies in a cookie
- TOFFEE - buttery and crisp

I understand the sentiment that these cookies are expensive considering how short lived these cookies were (literally) but these cookies are so, sooo tasty. I think they might even be better than Antoine&apos;s in San Mateo ?! 

If you are a fan of cookies, you&apos;ll like Anthony&apos;s. If you can&apos;t tell a great cookie apart from a good cookie, eh, you&apos;ll probably think you wasted your money."
5,"Walked by one day and decided to stop in since I had heard such good things about it. Picked up the walnut chocolate chip and the toffee chip cookies. Tasty! Not overly sweet, had a nice chew. Wish they were bigger or that I had bought more since we polished them off so quickly but I had limited myself since we already had dessert waiting for us at home. The bf preferred the walnut chip. I think I did too but it was nice getting the toffee chip since I see that less often."
3,The crunch and chew of these cookies really cannot be replicated. My favorite is probably the cookies and cream. The classic chocolate chip is nothing too special and the prices are really steep. I probably wouldn&apos;t come here again but I&apos;m glad I got to experience it!
5,"Cinnamon spice cookies!!! I like that the cookies have a unique blend of soft, chewy, and thick. It&apos;s mostly hard but not in a bad way. The texture is on the stiffer side but with a wonderful chewiness to it. It&apos;s not overly soft so the texture is just right. Other cookies are overly sweet but these seemed reasonable. Strong cinnamon taste! Coming here again tomorrow."
5,"As someone who is a pretty avid baker and makes a LOT of cookies at home, I very rarely actually buy cookies from a shop or a bakery. But then at a potluck at a friend&apos;s place a while back, someone brought a box of cookies from Anthony&apos;s. When I couldn&apos;t stop myself from eating more than one, I knew I had to come back myself. 

My boyfriend is more of a crispy cookie lover and I&apos;m more of a soft and chewy cookie person, but their cookies somehow satisfy us both. They&apos;re just slightly crispy on the outside yet nice and chewy on the inside that it&apos;s really the perfect texture for everyone (even when they&apos;ve been sitting around a couple of days!)

They&apos;re a little small in size, but I just use that as an opportunity to buy more of them so I can try them all (that&apos;s how that works, right?) I&apos;ve had more than half of their flavors at this point. I think the toffee chip is my personal favorite, but honestly I can&apos;t really find a fault in any of them. 

Anthony&apos;s is definitely my new go to cookie spot for when I&apos;m not baking them myself!"
3,"They only wear masks when customers come in, if that bothers you, beware. I came in and the girl making the cookies put her mask on and was very kind. She got my cookies right away and told me to have a nice day. It costs $13.75 for 6 cookies. They have merch, ice cream and drinks. Cookies are pretty good! Will be back to try different flavors."
5,"If you love cookies you gotta come here! The cookies and cream is DELISH. All of the cookies are so good (chocolate chip, toffee chip, oatmeal raisin). 

Customer service: 10/10. Every time I come here the staff is always so friendly."
2,"Love their cookies! Just wish they were cheaper! Yelp needs to change $ to $$$$ 

I can&apos;t justify spending $2.25 for a cookie that is literally gone in 3 bites!! They are tiny! Too expensive for the size."
4,"We had a Black History Month celebration at our office and I ordered cookies from Anthony&apos;s for this special occasion - my colleagues loved it, as well as my husband, for whom I brought a walnut cookie.

I love their flavor selection and it&apos;s great to see that they also offer gluten free options...for those people, you know ;-)

My only suggestion for Anthony would be to make the &quot;mass-ordering&quot; process a bit simpler. I actually like that you have to call the business to place an order, but I called on three several days at different days and I didn&apos;t get a hold of anyone...no voicemail either. And there&apos;s no contact form or email on the website either.

But my tenacity was eventually rewarded and I spoke to a lovely lady on the phone who took my order for 120 cookies."
5,THE BESTEST COOKIES EVER !!!! Can&apos;t get enough of it!! Cookies and cream will always be a favorite and the staff was very friendly! A bit pricey but definitely worth it!
3,"I like cookies, but I don&apos;t like buying individual cookies at prices as if they are sushi. I&apos;d rather just get a bucket from trader joes or a costco size pack or even just keiblers/nabisco. All cookies taste the same (except ira&apos;s)."
5,"Yum so good!!!! Tried this place out a few weeks ago and it was seriously soo good. The cookies are crispy and chewy at the same time. I tried the chocolate chip, toffee, cookies and cream, and chocolate walnut and they were all delicious. My favorite was the toffee cookie. I used to love the toffee nut cookie from Panera bread until they discontinued it and this cookie has a very similar flavor. I can&apos;t wait to get it again! The cookies and cream was also notable - it was the perfect combo of Oreo and chewy cookie. They&apos;re only $2 and my only downside to this place is I wish the cookies were bigger. I will definitely be coming back."
5,"This could have been a Cinderella (or Cinderfella) story. SFSU student of engineering and accounting turns to support himself through school by baking cookies. His friends loved them. He tested the market. Customers loved them. So was born Anthony&apos;s Cookies (in the Mission District). Needing a sweet treat? Go online to order for pick up or delivery. You can eat name brands from fancy shops but if you want to support a local, home-grown small business, call Anthony&apos;s right now! Milk and cookies? Yes, please! Nom nom nom...."
