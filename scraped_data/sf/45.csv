5,"Lou&apos;s is a homey place with a creative menu. It&apos;s as if your Mom researched all the possible combinations before making you a sandwich. Their soups look great, although I&apos;ve yet to try them. Next time.

The sandwiches are of generous size, with great bread options. However, I continue to order the same salad, Cobb, since it&apos;s so good. I opt for no bacon as a vegetarian. The lettuce is perfectly coated with dressing, either Blue Cheese or Ranch as you choose. The avocado slices are just the right amount, like the eggs and shredded Cheddar cheese. All the ingredients are nicely tossed together.

I suggest ordering ahead, since there is often a line. Pre-COVID, I preferred to sit at the window, where there are a few stools. In the cafe, there are several tables. Check out their other locations, if you&apos;re not in the area. Lou&apos;s has delicious food!"
5,This is my absolute favorite sandwich place in San Francisco!!! It&apos;s always a bit crowded when I go so I always order ahead or get delivery!! It&apos;s def a must try!
5,"Big fan of the location on Taraval. Since they were closed from Christmas until New Years, we went to this location since we were just really craving it! Luckily, we beat the rush (for the most part). We ordered our usuals (LLB sandwich, ultimate club, chicken apple sausage breakfast sammie all with no cheese). I also got a cup of clam chowder, which is always good.

Sandwiches were the same excellent quality! There was a bit of a wait because by the time we paid, there was a huge rush of people! This is the most crowded I&apos;ve seen a Lou&apos;s, so I&apos;m assuming people who usually go to the Taraval location had the same idea as us to go here. We called the order ahead of time, which I think saved us some time in the long run. But it still was a bit of a wait. Honestly, we don&apos;t mind waiting the extra couple of minutes because the food is THAT good. And also, since it was extremely busy at the time, it was expected.

Very COVID compliant (everyone wearing masks and gloves). And they encourage people to wait outside rather than inside, since it&apos;s a pretty tight space. 

We&apos;ll probably still frequent the Taraval location more (since it&apos;s closer and more familiar), but it&apos;s great to know that another location is also relatively close by!"
5,"Nothing beats a good, hearty sandwich, and Lou&apos;s Ami-Cado Sandwich is one of the best I have ever had!! First of all, great sandwich for the price and the ingredients that are packed into it. Love each part of the sandwich and it was so well-executed, like the bread (the sweet roll) was seriously delicious.

There was a bit of a line when we got there, which was expected. The wait is going to be longer than your typical sandwich shop but it is well worth it. They are pretty strict about how many people are in their shop at once (rightfully so), but the ordering process was pretty streamlined overall. Devoured the sandwich in the car, and I was left wanting more."
5,"My absolute favorite vegetarian sandwich in SF! 

I always order the Veggie and it&apos;s perfect every time. Lou&apos;s has really figured out how to make tasty and filling sammies : )"
4,"Food: 5 stars
Pickup / service: 2.5 stars

The sandwiches from Lou&apos;s are delicious and filling. My husband who does not like most sandwiches suggests that we order from Lou&apos;s on a regular basis. His favorite is the ami-cado and my favorite is the veggie-licious. 

During the pandemic, we have ordered from them many times and their estimates on when the sandwiches will be ready are rarely accurate. They always say 15-20 minutes, but we have waited an hour for our sandwiches before. If they could be more accurate about timing, this would easily be a 5 star rating.

If you aren&apos;t working on a tight timeline or have a crying baby waiting in your car, I would highly recommend ordering from Lou&apos;s."
5,"Probably the best sandwich I ever had. It was so good and I would definitely recommend!! We got the pomaikai and ami-cado. Both were so good- the flavors, special sauce and bread were all flavorful and great. We liked the ami-cado better and would probably get that and try something else next time we come.

Service was good and the staff was very friendly!"
5,This is hands down the best sandwich shop I have been to. The Dutch crunch bread is incredible. The sandwiches have a ton of layers and ingredients. It wasn&apos;t just bread a ton of bread which is nice. This place definitely lived up to its reputation. It did take about 30 minutes to make two sandwiches so keep that in mind when ordering. They were really busy.
4,"Ordering sandwiches were easy on a Friday afternoon around 2pm.  We were starving and craving a good sandwich spot. We called in and the sandwiches were ready in 15 mins. It&apos;s a pretty small spot and they don&apos;t have any seats inside or outside -- totally fine for us since we were headed home to inhale the sandwiches anyway.

There was plexiglass surrounding the cashier area and payment was easy to do with Apple Pay; so all good in that department. There&apos;s also an assortment of chips and drinks that you can choose from before paying. You have to pick up your own bag of chips, though. So if you&apos;re the type to do the little &quot;indecisive dance&quot; where you grab the Kettle BBQ, then the salt and vinegar, then put it back, then get the cheddar, then put it back... everyone can see you.

My husband got the Risky Business and I got the Hot Pastrami. We both really enjoyed the sammies. It wasn&apos;t as large of a sandwich as I thought it was going to be (a good thing). It definitely wasn&apos;t one of those sandos where you have to hard press the sandwich to the table just to get a good bite in. It was very filling though! I hate half of the Hot Pastrami, a bag of chips, and a coconut water -- I was good!

I totally would come back to try the Lou&apos;s Special Sauce. Why didn&apos;t I do more research on Yelp before ordering?! Never order quick and hangry."
5,"10/10 recommend. I&apos;ve been going here for years, never had a problem with my order &amp; never had to wait an unreasonable amount of time. Their sandwiches are my absolute favorite in the city!! Try the chicken pesto, risky business, the crab salad, the Asian chicken salad, honestly just try anything on the menu because I&apos;ve never been disappointed with this place. Hits the spot every time and they&apos;re the perfect picnic grub"
5,"I&apos;m not usually a big sandwich fan, but Lou&apos;s makes me reconsider that! I&apos;ve always heard of Lou&apos;s but I&apos;ve never tried it until my coworkers and I decided to grab lunch here! I got the Veggie-licious sandwich and the whole sandwich was so flavorful and delicious! The sandwich was packed with veggies, and the sauce just enhanced the whole sandwich! The next time I want to have a picnic in Golden Gate Park or even if I have a craving for sandwiches, I&apos;ll definitely grab it at Lou&apos;s!"
5,"Consistently good sandwiches as well as yummy salads. Easy, safe pick up. Neighborhood feel."
5,Super good Lou Ruben has a little heat and amazing bread.  They would not allow me to eat inside but covid is just lifting so whatever.  I will definitely be back to try others on the menu.
5,"What can I say about Lou&apos;s that others haven&apos;t already? 

Love it or hate it, it&apos;s still a pretty great little sandwich place in the neighborhood. I&apos;m actually not a sandwich person (except for Vietnamese sandwiches), but I really like Lou&apos;s for their BPAV. Of all the sandwiches we tried together, this is my favorite.

BPAV = Bacon, alfalfa sprouts, roasted peppers, avocado, cucumber, pepperoncinis, Monterey Jack cheese and Lou&apos;s special sauce on a Dutch crunch. Includes lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, pickles and jalapeno spread.

Hubby loves this place, but occasionally complains to me about how slow it can be here as there are a lot of big or group orders. 

So just be aware that if you see a bunch of hangry people in front of this shop, it&apos;s &apos;cuz they haven&apos;t gotten their sandwiches yet."
4,"Lou&apos;s is great. I love their Italian sandwich on Dutch crunch bread and the Asian chicken salad. When I&apos;m in a rush or feeling too lazy to cook, this place always comes to mind. If you&apos;re having a park day, a sandwich from Lou&apos;s would be a great option!!

Tip: order ahead bc it can get busy at prime lunch/dinner time!"
5,"Lou&apos;s Cafe has been making picnic perfect sandwiches in San Francisco since 2010, and now has three locations in the city.
⁣
I ordered the Ami-Cado, which has salami, pastrami, avocado, pepper jack, and jalapeño on a soft and sweet roll.

Their jalapeño spread adds an extra kick to the sandwich, and I&apos;m not usually a Jalapeño person. 

Even with COVID, there are lines out the door for take out and Door Dash.  

At under $10, and with many choices, you can&apos;t go wrong here. I never really crave a sandwich, but when I do, it&apos;s sure to be Lou&apos;s now."
4,"Buffalo chicken sandwich was five stars. The deluxe BLT was just a mouthful of somewhat dry deli meat (on really good bread). The sauce helped, as did all the other fixings. I ordered to go via Grubhub and when I arrived 20 min later they said my order was just placed by the system. So I had to wait another 25 min."
5,"Called ahead and ordered for pick up which was a great move. I believe they deliver too. 

I got the veggielicious sandwich which was great! I thought it was very filling and had it for two meals. The price is very reasonable too."
4,"A solid sandwich and a great idea for a picnic in the golden gate park. Got the chicken pesto and replaced the bread for Dutch crunch. It was a pretty sandwich and the bread was fantastic, but I didn&apos;t really enjoy the slices of chicken--would&apos;ve been better with bite size pieces like in the bbq chicken sandwich."
5,"I literally never eat sandwiches but if I am in the Richmond and I am craving a breakfast sandwich, you will definitely find me here. I can&apos;t speak on any of the other sandwiches other than the breakfast line. However, their breakfast sandwiches are so delicious.

My two personal favorites are the classic breakfast sandwich on Dutch crunch bread and my all-time favorite, the corn beef hash sandwich. Carb lovers delight and macro counting nightmare . Corn beef hash patty and hash brown patty stuffed in between two cheesy buns with a special sauce smothered on top."
