5,"Came back to Plow for a COVID brunch even though I said I probably wouldn&apos;t return due to the wait.... and I&apos;m soooo happy I did!!!  There was still a wait, but what made it easier was that the weather was warmer (always a mood booster), and we spent most of our time at Farley&apos;s new outdoor seating area under two beautiful trees.  While there, we drank our tea and coffee while maintaining line of sight with Plow, watching the groups ahead of us get seated. 

Ok, I know the wait and seating arrangements of another restaurant aren&apos;t the reason you&apos;re reading this review.  I just felt I needed to address the hangup I had about Plow, so I got that out of my system.

This latest five star review is for the FOOD.  We both ordered the soft scrambled eggs... and they are AMAZING!!!  I&apos;ve gotten pretty good at making eggs during COVID, but this dish reminded me just how big the gap is between me and a professional chef.  They were perfection.  Utterly decadent, yet also had the illusion of feeling healthy due to the quantity and quality of the mushrooms and greens. Nomnomnommmm

Same thing with the plow potatoes.  We&apos;ve been roasting a ton of vegetables and potatoes at home, but we&apos;ve never made anything so crispy, flavorful and satisfying as the plow potatoes.  The server tried to take away my husband&apos;s plate when he only had the little fried bits of potatoes left over on his plate, and he quickly waved them away.  He was saving those for last.  

Service was super friendly, as always.  One interesting thing we learned is that they can make most dishes on their menu vegetarian by swapping out the meat for avocadoes, etc.  As new vegetarians still eating our way through SF, that was a useful tidbit to tuck away."
5,"Wow.

I cannot believe it took me this long to try this place.

Word on the street was that pre-Covid, it was about an hour to two hour wait to grab a table for breakfast/brunch. I can happily say that I waited zero minutes for a table during Covid era.

For those who are wondering: Yes, the tables are spread out. The utensils are individually packaged with a thick napkin. Everyone is wearing masks. All of the tables are wiped down between customers. You will feel safe dining outdoors here.

Now, let&apos;s move onto the food. The food is de-friggin-licious. The custard French toast is one of the best French toasts I have ever tasted. Nothing beats sautéed caramelized fruits and real maple syrup on French toast. The breakfast sausages are homemade. Super plump, juicy, and 10x tastier than the stuff you&apos;ll find in the frozen section of any grocery store. And goddamn, what is in their breakfast potatoes? It is insanely crunchy and savory. I can confidently say that their potatoes is my favorite breakfast potatoes in all of SF.

Bravo, Plow. I hope you stick around for a long time."
5,"Wanted to have one last outdoor dining experience before Bay Area COVID Lockdown Part 2. Had to make it a good one and Plow did not disappoint. 

Wait was 45 mins for party of 2 at on Sunday 11am. Outdoor dining tables are spread out and diners are supposed to keep masks on whenever not eating. Overall felt like a safe dining environment.

The prosciutto &amp; gruyère toast was amazing. The toast was thick and buttery, and you can really taste the quality of the prosciutto and gruyère. The potatoes were perfectly crispy and seasoned-- not your usual side of bland potatoes that you don&apos;t even want to finish. 

Service was great. Our server was attentive and checked on us regularly. The bathroom inside was super clean and had a smart toilet and automatic everything!"
5,"This place warms my heart and was such a great brunch find! There is always a long wait on the weekends so I recommend putting your name in at least an hour before you want to eat and then grabbing a coffee and taking in the nice scenery around. They don&apos;t have a ton of seating available so definitely take this into account before going.

Okay now the food was absolutely amazing-perfectly portioned and such a reviving brunch. We started off with the biscuit which was a well done flaky biscuit with a warm and soft interior. I ordered the plow which consisted of eggs, pancakes, potatoes, and choice of protein. The two (small) lemon ricotta pancakes tasted soooo delicious and were not too sweet. After the waiter educated me about the different ways to cook an egg I got my two eggs cooked overmedium over a bed of well seasoned and perfectly crispy potatoes. It paired perfectly with the house made pork sausage. Everything tasted delicious and I devoured every last bit of the meal. 

My friends got the fried chicken sandwich which they loved and I stole a bite of that chicken and wow it is definitely a standout. It is also hugeee. The service was super friendly and I enjoyed the atmosphere of the place. The waiter came by with coffee refills which was nice! 

Definitely a reason for me to venture out to this side of the city and I can&apos;t wait to go back for another amazing brunch!"
4,"Rating: 3.5

I took advantage of the fact that Plow was doing takeout to try to get my brunch fix without the usual ridiculous wait time. 

Takeout: 
Lemon ricotta pancakes - This time they were a little bit overdone as the pancakes were quite brown so they were a little bit drier than normal. Slightly disappointing since this was what I was craving specifically.

Bacon Benedict - this was surprisingly really good even as we ate it sloppily in the car. The bacon was crispy but still soft if that is even possible, but it was a great texture and contrast to the fresh runny eggs and sauce. It was on bread and I&apos;m not sure if it was supposed to be English muffins, but I don&apos;t like English muffins anyway so I actually preferred the thick toast. Of course the famous potatoes were crispy and flavorful.

I&apos;ve been here to dine in a very long time ago but I was forever scarred by the 1.5 hour wait that we endured. The food here is solid but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s worth the wait because it&apos;s not that special. I&apos;m giving them a generous 4 for the food but my true rating is 3.5 because the wait is just not justified."
4,"While Plow seems to always have a wait for brunch outside of COVID-times, the zero wait time for take out seems to be the silver lining. We ordered brunch take out last weekend: we called in our order, was quoted 15 minutes, got there 15 minutes later and our food was ready to go. 

The food was delicious - we got the Dungeness crab scramble and the plow. The scramble tasted very fresh and my boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed the plow.

Because it was take out, the house potatoes weren&apos;t as good as dining in, but I wish they could&apos;ve packed the potatoes separately so it wouldn&apos;t get all moist and steamy inside the container (i.e. poking holes or leaving container semi-open) and speed up the sogging process, especially since it&apos;s the compostable packaging that seeps through quite quickly. Another thing is, I remembered the servings to be a little bigger when dining in? But, can&apos;t say for sure. 

Overall, the zero wait time is a huge plus and the main dishes were on point! We&apos;ll probably stop by again next time we&apos;re in the city in the early morning!"
3,"The wait time was almost 2 hours on a Sunday and my friend and I waited because we heard such good things. When we finally got seated, the waitress took our orders for drinks and we never got our drinks. At the end, we were charged for the drinks so I had to remind her we never got them so they could get removed from the bill. My brunch was so so in terms of brunches I&apos;ve had over the years. I have pretty high standards when it comes to brunch since I&apos;ve been to some pretty amazing spots over the years and brunch is one of my favorite meals. My lemon ricotta pancakes were super tiny and a little burned. My potatoes had some burned pieces from the griddle. My poached eggs didn&apos;t have much flavor. Overall it was just meh. I probably won&apos;t be back and I wouldn&apos;t wait those crazy wait times. Not worth it!"
4,"Our group of 3 waited around 20 minutes for outdoor seating on a Monday around 11am. The last attempt at eating here was pre-COVID and over an hour wait, and had I had to wait that long I wouldn&apos;t have considered it worth the hype.

The servers are really nice and down to earth, not fake-friendly and performative. They remind you with a small sign to keep your mask on as much as possible. Their bathroom is still open indoors. 

The menu items are definitely on the pricier end, but me and my two friends split the Plow and a 3-piece Custard French Toast for under $16 a piece including 18% tip! Not too bad considering getting one Plow dish sets one diner back over $20. I&apos;d recommend eating family style if you&apos;re comfortable with it.

The French toast with poached eggs were really rich but not too sweet. $18 for 3 pieces. The Plow isn&apos;t as hefty a dish as you might expect for $19, but it&apos;s great for trying several items. The lemon ricotta pancakes had a strong enough lemon flavor and weren&apos;t soggy. The potatoes were perfectly crispy. The chicken sausage was surprisingly filling, even when split with friends. The eggs were...eggs. 

I love that Dogpatch is a quieter area with secret views most tourists don&apos;t know about. It&apos;s a great place to wait around if you have to endure the usual 1hr+ line.

All in all, not the most memorable brunch, but a nice, cute spot that delivered a good experience."
5,"Wow, this place ain&apos;t playing!! All that hype...WAS SO WORTH!! My experience was PRE-COVID &amp; I actually came on a weekday around 8am with the  boo...where we legit still had to wait an HR?!? (can you imagine it on a weekend?!!). Regardless we were chillen so the wait felt like less than hour while the staff gave us updates throughout which was nice.

Let&apos;s dig in:
(1) House biscuit - simply beautiful, soft buttery pillows WITH more yummy house made creamy butter on the side.
(2) The Plow breakfast plate - this was freakn bomb!! Potatoes were crispy, sausages were tasty and flavorful without being too salty (which is rare), and then lemon ricotta mini pancakes - were the highlight of it all!! Perfectly lemony and so FN fluffy!!
(4) Prosciutto &amp; Gruyere toast - soooo tasty!! The thick toast was beautiful and buttery, with layered thin beautiful prosciutto slices, topped with a sunny side egg and chili flakes for a nice kick +++ them bomba** crispy potatoes."
3,"Their weekend menu lacks their star dish: Chinese breakfast!
This place is quite expensive once you add coffee, juice and two dishes."
4,"Amazing breakfast/brunch spot to check out in Potrero Hill! Came here at 12 and the place was packed. I didn&apos;t expect so many people out and about on a work day during covid but I guess it was Friday so people were gearing up for weekend mode! We had to wait a little over 20 mins and then were seated outside. They also have indoor dining which was surprising during covid but I was glad we got an outdoor table because it was a beautiful day!

Upon seating, our waitress requested we keep our masks on at all times whenever she or any other waitstaff approached. I understand given covid that safety comes first, but with the way that their outdoor tables are set up, it&apos;s super difficult to know when the workers are coming to your table vs any other table in the row. For this reason, any time someone walked outside in the direction of the outdoor tables (constantly), we had to keep a lookout and quickly throw our masks on. Found this to be distracting from my conversation and meal given I have never experienced this strict of rules while dining outdoors, but glad everyone&apos;s staying safe. 

We ordered the plow, which comes with a little bit of everything -- lemon ricotta pancakes, eggs, choice of meat, and potatoes! The pancakes are super fluffy and I appreciated how they weren&apos;t overly sweet like many other places I order pancakes. I also loved the eggs and PLOWed through them :)

We were in a rush due to work calls so I appreciated the waitress coming back with the check and to go boxes in a hurry. The price tag on this brunch spot are definitely on the higher side even for SF prices -- $21+ pre tip for the plow is understandable given the variety and quality, but not given the quantity! The pancakes in the plow are super small (less than 2.5 inches in diameter if I had to estimate) and the eggs portion was also on the small side so the plate seemed to be filled mostly with potatoes! The average eater could easily PLOW through this whole plate and still take down more."
4,"My favorite and go-to brunch place in SF, and that&apos;s coming from someone who easily finds brunch places overrated. This is probably like a 4.5 star place for me, the main cons being the wait and the price (it is not the cheapest, but it&apos;s still quite reasonable for the quality).

I&apos;ll start by saying I&apos;ve been fortunate enough to never have had to wait 2 hours for a table, which is pretty common. I&apos;m lucky enough to live not too far away, so it&apos;s pretty easy for me to stop by during more off hours like weekday mornings, or to just go home if the wait is too long. Because of this I can&apos;t really comment on what the wait is like for an average weekend, but I know it can get pretty crazy. 

Food wise, I think the things that really stand out about this place are the biscuit and the potatoes (and maybe the pancakes as well). I generally go with the plow for my entree because you get to try a little bit of everything, both sweet and savory.

The biscuit is one of my favorites in the city because it somehow defies logic by being crispy, flaky, and moist all at once. And just when you think it can&apos;t get any better, you get a bite slathered with honey butter. Trust me, you have to try it.

The potatoes are also solidly my favorite out of any brunch place I&apos;ve been to in SF. No one else seems to get them as perfectly crispy, salty, and fluffy, but they seriously nail it here. 

They&apos;re also well known for their pancakes. I can&apos;t say much about them since I have only tried the lemon ricotta ones, but I do think those are excellent. I&apos;ve also never tried their french toast, but they always look very tempting.

All the other brunch food (eggs, sausage, etc.) is pretty standard but you can tell they use really high quality ingredients. The sausage tastes really fresh and they use really seasonal ingredients in their drinks, salads, and sandwiches. Even their house made lemonade was really impressive. 

If you&apos;re looking for the best brunch in SF and are willing to wait (or come on a weekday), this cute spot is the place to go!"
5,"We got the fried egg sandwich and french toast- both of which were really good! The fried egg was runny on the inside which was delicious as it dribbled out as you bit into the sandwich. It also came with a side of home potatoes which were perfectly crispy and cooked! 

But the star of the breakfast was the french toast!! It was SO delicious- it was a custard french toast with poached pears, vanilla mascarpone, and maple syrup. Everything about it was so good. We will definitely be coming back here! 

For COVID, the store has outdoor seating on the side of the street. There aren&apos;t too many tables so I recommend going at an off time to avoid long waits."
5,"Plow is a great brunch spot with a rotational menu and fantastic vegetarian options. The Custard French toast topped with balsamic glazed strawberries, fresh whipped cream, and maple syrup is a must try!"
4,"I came here on a Friday around noon and the wait for one of their outdoor tables was only about ~10-15 min. I ordered The Plow and I really liked everything it came with. The potatoes are crispy and the lemon ricotta pancakes are fluffy and soo good. You can choose how you want your eggs cooked and for protein you have a choice between chicken sausage, their house sausage, and bacon I think. I recommend this if you want to try a little bit of everything."
5,"I came for a breakfast. Wait times will be long, so expect that before coming. I waited for at least an hour to hour half.
Overall, Plow provided a pretty filling meal. I was able to try their signature lemon ricotta pancake, in addition to their sausage and scrambled eggs off their side items menu. Absolutely delightful taste. The potatoes were actually a bit too flavored but that&apos;s just my preference. Each breakfast item they made was unique in its own way. It makes sense why they are so popular and highly rated. 

MUST TRY: pancakes, potatoes, and biscuits to start"
5,"COVID-19 UPDATE. They offer take out, yesss!

There&apos;s outdoor seating, about 6 or more tables I think? Tables are sufficiently spaced apart. Employees are wearing masks.

What We Ordered:
+ The Plow, 5/5
+ Hong Kong Toast, 4/5 (boyfriend says great dessert, heavy though)

Pros:
+ The Plow is always a hit every time we go!
+ Take out order is fast, ~20 min

Cons:
- Wait times for a table are still ~1HR

The Plow includes 2 palm sized lemon ricotta pancakes (THE BEST!), 2 eggs, 2 pork sausages (THE BEST!), and crispy potatoes (SO GOOD!). So glad they offer take out now! I get to enjoy the food in the comfort of my own home AND I don&apos;t have to wait forever for a table."
4,"On the rare occasion that I went into San Francisco during this pandemic, I thought I had to do something special.

No indoor dining
No hotel dining
No bars
No (you fill in the blank)

I had to feel better about myself, and I remember...Plow does have outdoor seating.  This was a rare sunny day, so I didn&apos;t need the jacket, didn&apos;t have to wait, and didn&apos;t have a single complaint.

Yeah, I&apos;ll do it again."
5,"Haven&apos;t been out for brunch in SF for a while and I was perfectly happy that we decided to try Plow. It&apos;s been on my bucket list for a while, but I haven&apos;t had the chance to go out as much during COVID. SF&apos;s brunch game is always strong, but Plow definitely tops the list!

They have the freshest eggs I&apos;ve yet to have in SF! Which sounds silly, but for an egg lover it makes a huge difference with your breakfast experience. You can tell by looking at the color of the yolk. It was a rich orange color like the eggs I can get in Japan or Spain. 

Lemon ricotta pancakes- probably some of the best lemon ricotta pancakes I&apos;ve ever had. Whenever I order pancakes anywhere I look to see if there is a lemon ricotta option. I like the ones Plow serves because they are extra lemony. 

They do a superb job with their potatoes. Super crispy and flavorful. 

The Chinese breakfast was also really good. I loved that they used jasmine rice which had a good aroma. The pork shoulder was super tender and packed with tons of flavor. I was surprised to see an Asian dish on the menu and even more surprised at how good it was."
5,"Such a great spot for brunch! Bottomless coffee combined with their plow platter is what I would eat every weekend morning if I could. Their plow plate has deep fried home potatoes, your choice of protein, and 2 ricotta pancakes. Their deep fried potatoes are famous for its crisp and golden brown goodness. I had the pork patty while my boyfriend had the chicken sausage. Both were delicious, and I can definitely find some asian inspired fusion behind some of their menu items. Their pork patty reminded me of the ones I would eat at home with my parents, with a hint of asian spices. Lastly, the ricotta pancakes were fluffy and brought the meal all together by giving us a lil sweet to balance the savory in our meal. Wait time was roughly around 30 minutes during COVID times. 

My boyfriend &amp; I definitely plow&apos;d thru this meal :&apos;)."
