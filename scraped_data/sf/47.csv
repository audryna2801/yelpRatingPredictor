5,"Excellent Korean-Mexican fusion! I&apos;ve tried a few items on the menu, but the Breakfast Burrito is amazing. I&apos;m hard to impress when it comes to burritos, but this is one of the best in the city. I got this with bulgogi and the entire thing was a perfect balance of sweet, salty, sour, tender and crispy. Each item in the burrito had its own unique flavor, but everything tasted great together.

They have outdoor seating and the service is very good."
5,"My wife has been wanting to try Tacorea for a long time now! You know what that means...! With so much time doing nothing, the best thing we can do is eat. The location is pretty easy to get to and they have outdoor seating available. Parking was pretty easy too. 

We ordered:

Kimchi Burrito: 4.5/5. Very unique for a burrito! The tang from the Spicy Pork and the Kimchi was a real nice twist. Our tortilla was also extra crisp which definitely helped with the overall bite. 

Four Tacos - Mama Lees Spicy Pork (4.5/5), Bulgogi (5/5), Carnitas (4/5), Pollo (4/5): Overall, all the flavors were very solid! My favorite was the Bulgogi, but I absolutely recommend trying the rest. I definitely recommend eating your Tacos right away or you will definitely lose out! Best while fresh. 

We definitely want to come back and try the Big Ricardo and the Lil Kodak Quesadilla and of course grab a few more tacos. We skipped on the tots, but next time we will also make sure to grab some too!"
5,"**TAKE-OUT**

The pandemic is rough, but Tacorea is still turning out delish, flavorful dishes that hits all parts of your tasting palate in the best way! I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of my bulgogi quesadilla with chips and two salsas. The sweet, tender bulgogi is a genius balance to their guacamole and salsas. I&apos;ll be back again and again! Support your local businesses like Tacorea! Go find it! Go rediscover it, San Francisco!"
4,"I never thought a fusion burrito would work, but it did! I got the Tacorea kimchi burrito with bulgogi and it was exactly the way I thought it should taste like -- sweet and flavorful bulgogi, well made kimchi, and all the yummy fixings of a burrito with tomato, onion, rice, etc. 

I also tried the California burrito because I was so tempted by the tater tots and it ended up being my favorite one. The tater tots aren&apos;t crispy (I shouldn&apos;t have expected this to begin with), but they are such a nice addition. 

I also had a bite of an El Super burrito with bulgogi and the flavor was much more subtle. It tasted like a typical burrito with a faint sweetness from the bulgogi. It would&apos;ve been hard to tell it was in there if I hadn&apos;t known. If you want a stronger bulgogi taste / fusion, I would recommend the Tacorea kimchi burrito instead.

Overall, I thought everything was great and the free chips and salsa with a burrito order was a nice plus. The only thing is that the meal can make you extremely afterwards so be ready to drink some water. These burritos also fill you up and you can get palate fatigue quickly, so pace yourself when eating!"
5,"This place is bomb.com! I ordered the Ricardo and shared it with my friend because I knew for a fact I couldn&apos;t have possibly finished it on my own. This is basically a wet burrito topped with a sunny side up. We replaced the bulgogi meat with carnitas (only because we didn&apos;t want something too sweet) and it was so very delicious!  Even sharing with two people, we couldn&apos;t finish it. What was so great about it was the fact that they had chips around the burrito too! The chips were so perfect because you can use it to dip the leftover sauce around the burrito.

Because of COVID, we called in and order thru the phone. The phone call was abrupt and impersonal.. I had to even call back to confirm they received my order because they just hung up on me with no confirmation phone number or any information on how long it would take. 

Aside from the poor service, I&apos;d only give this place a 5 stars just for the food. I&apos;d probably come back and order the same thing next time!"
4,"SIP and wanted to stop by Union Square to see the fabulous Christmas tree. Made sure I found a place on Yelp to see what was available. Tacorea caught my eye as I looked at the menu. Mexican/Korean fusion flavors? As interesting it sounded I made the decision this will be my go to. Called and ordered immediately 6 bulgogi tacos and a side of tater tots. 

Although no outdoor dining, we took our food to union square and ate beneath the stars. You would think it would be cold outside but it was perfect. 
The outcome? My bf&apos;s first words that came out were oh my god! I said what? He finishes eating saying its soooo good. My first bite? Wow robust innovative flavors. The combination of bulgogi on corn tortillas was amazing. Tots were crispy and not a soggy one in site. Definitely a great pick in 2020."
5,"The Korean/Mexican fusion arena is poppin and highly competitive right now. Tacorea stands out to me because they work hard on their flavors. It&apos;s pretty easy to throw egg, meat, rice and sriracha together with furikake and it can get borrrrrring.

I ordered in person and it was a pretty quick turnaround. Was cool to watch the cooks whip up the pork on the grill and put my bowl together. Was a pretty reasonable price given its location in SF.

The pork was well cooked and seasoned. It wasn&apos;t too fatty either which a lot of places lean on for that rich mouth feel. The egg was perfectly cooked as well, a little runny but a more dense consistency. Super filling with a large portion of rice but not too much (again, a lot of places lean on giving you 3 cups of rice).  House kimchi was also tasty and spicy, I liked that it was chopped up. Could&apos;ve used more and perhaps upped the spice level though. I&apos;d definitely try other dishes if I was around again."
5,"I heard about this plAce even from bay Area how good it is. 
I didn&apos;t even know what to order when I got there 
But oh well &quot;Big recardo&quot; sounded good so 

One mistake I made was that both burritto and ricardo I ordered had bulgogi inside. It made both burritto tasted basically the same :( 

The price wasn&apos;t very nice but I knew why when I got home. 

It was huge. Enormous indeed. 
Like chipotle burritto but with everything. 

And plus more than half of the burrito consisted of meat :0 

Oh well that was big surprise and The flavor was really good. 

Enchilada sauce went really well with Korean style meat flavor. 

I would definitely come back when I stop by at SF"
5,"I had mixed feelings about this place because I&apos;ve never heard of Korean &amp; Mexican fusion back then, but the pictures of the food looked bomb.  My friend and I came here for dinner before heading over to MOIC.  We shared a quesadilla and the tater tot nachos and I&apos;m so glad we chose to get food here.  The food tasted just as good as the pictures look and it was enough to fill both of us up.  The hospitality stood out to me.  This review is 3.5 years late but I still remember the sweet mom clearing the counter so my friend and I would have a place to sit (it was very busy at the time), and she really wanted to make sure we were happy."
5,"My go to place for a burrito.  Their kimchi burrito is the way to go for a unique twist to the CA burrito.  I switch between the kimchi and the Super Burrito with their spicy pork.  Their spicy pork is really unique.  Super tender and juicy and full of flavors.  Other meats are fine, but if you really want that kick and the Korean twist to a classic burrito, you have to try it with their spicy pork meat.   Their kimchi in the kimchi burrito has just the right kick and tanginess.  It&apos;s not overly sweet.  Great blend of flavors between the kimchi, pork and specialty kimchi rice.  I do feel that I get more ingredients when I order the Super Burrito vs kimchi burrito.  However, I still get the kimchi burrito is super unique.  It&apos;s also great as leftovers as well.  Just be sure to use a toaster oven or regular oven the next day when you heat it up.

I do like the Big Ricardo.  It&apos;s huge.  Definitely big enough to share.  The sauce and the egg on top is just the right touch the gigantic burrito.   Not a big fan of the tator tots.  However with the sauce and all the other flavors in the dish, it&apos;s just the right combo.  The only thing about this dish is that it&apos;ll be better if you can eat it at the store.  For takeout, it&apos;s not as good because the sauce makes the burrito a bit soggy overtime.    

The breakfast burrito is just average.  I tried it once, but the chirizo is just average with the tator tots.  But that&apos;s not the reason to come to Tacorea.  It&apos;s for the other burritos.

Be sure to ask for the green salsa.  They give you the red salsa and some chips on the side, but the green salsa is super good.  It&apos;s a bit more spicy and I just love the cilantro flavor.   The chips are a hit or miss.  Recently they&apos;ve been pretty good and crispy.  But I&apos;ve had stale chips before as well.  

They also have a new location in Chinatown.  It&apos;s nice to see this local restaurant is doing so well that they can open up another shop."
5,"I give a 5 because every time I eat here, it has been super consistent. They got a flow going on and I love it. I noticed their salsa game has changed. A little more spicy and I am happy about it. The ingredients are always fresh. I&apos;m every single bite. I have had like 6 different things on the menu. Was not let down at all. Plus they have dope stickers!! Which is just a plus :)"
5,"Excellent spot if you love actual solid burritos and want an Asian fusion twist to them ! Get the golgi beef , you won&apos;t regret it !!"
3,"The menu was quite limited, and the food taste was ok, though they have a couple of vegetarian options for those of us who don&apos;t consume meat as well. Also, the service was not good, constantly chasing staff for items, others as well had to chase for service, even paying the bill was slow."
5,"Amazing food.. cute outdoor dining area... green sauce is addictively appealing. You must try! Hip. Right in my neighborhood and I just discovered this place bc of my baby bro.  Worth stopping by! The fusion of familiarity and new flavors and textures makes this a very unique and new experience, so comforting and satisfying."
4,"A unique Korean-Mexican fusion takeout spot definitely worth a try (and a retry).

Intrigued by the idea of a kimchi burrito and looking for a quick bite for lunch, I placed a phone order for pickup from this spot near Union Square (Note: They only do orders via phone for pickup).

Service was fast (15-20 minutes) and super friendly.

Slightly disappointed with the kimchi burrito. Felt it was a little on the sweet end and was looking for something more tasty. But absolutely LOVED the totchos--loaded with flavor and yum factor! Realized that maybe the way to go next time (and there will be a next time) would be getting the totchos again for sure, plus a more traditional Mexican burrito with a Korean meat. Standby for a review update to come!"
3,"Ordered the Spicy Pork Bowl, it&apos;s too sweet and not spicy at all to my taste, the portion is good but I&apos;m not sure if I will try that again."
5,"I had this place bookmarked for a while, but never found the chance to come down here. I happened to be in the area and was able to stop by during SIP. They are taking orders at their front door and have people wait outside. I ordered the tacorea kimchi burrito and tater tot nachos. The photos looked really impressive so I was pretty excited. The food came out pretty fast after I ordered, with a fair amount of people waiting outside. 

The burrito was HUGE and definitely can be shared. The pork and kimchi wasn&apos;t overly spicy and tasted great. We loved the presentation of the tater tot nachos. It looked really clean and had generous portions of meat. We got it with the carnitas. I would recommend it to share as well. 

I really loved the food here! It was a new concept for us and it did not disappoint. Parking can be difficult here though. I hope to find time to come again soon. 

NOTE: They accepted my cash, but mentioned they didn&apos;t have any change (luckily for me it was just a few cents). Make sure to bring your card !"
5,Safe environment - outdoor dining. Menu is short but good enough - various choices Food is yummy - parking can be challenging
4,"Never would I have thought that I would of stumbled upon a place like this! Such a hole in the wall in the downtown of area of SF. For a while now I&apos;ve been trying to come to this place and to my liking, I thoroughly enjoyed all the food that was offered here. Tacorea as you may know, is a fusion of Mexican and Korean foods. I definitely knew this was a combination worth trying and when I ate the food there, it was definitely worth it.
 
It&apos;s a small shop, I actually it was going to be bigger but it&apos;s not really that big. So if anything, you might end up missing it as you walk past, but it shouldn&apos;t be that hard. I will say, the taste was really good and I loved the toning flare of Asian flavors incorporated with Mexican flavors. It&apos;s so unique. I think that&apos;s why my love for fusion food is pretty high up there haha. Everyone that works there is very friendly, and they work in such an efficient manner. I came here with my friend for dinner and she ordered the Bulgogi burrito and I got the Bulgogi tacos. Both were really good and filling, and I loved it. I would definitely come here again for lunch or even just a quick bite as well! 

Seating is limited! Like I said small store, so don&apos;t expect a seat especially if the store is busy. To-go would be your best option if you must avoid long lines."
5,"I can&apos;t sing high enough praise for Tacorea. The food and the people are incredible. Such an amazing addition to the 800 block of Bush Street. 

Tater Tot Nachos? 10/10
Bulgogi Quesadilla? 10/10 
The entire menu? 10/10"
