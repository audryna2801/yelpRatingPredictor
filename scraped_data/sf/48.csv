5,"Wow - F R E S H!! We ordered the dozen oysters, large cioppino and garlic bread for three of us and we were stuffed at the end. We called in takeout during Covid on a Friday late afternoon and we&apos;re able to say what time we wanted to pick it up which was really accommodating.

We had been wanting to try the famous San Francisco cioppino and we are so glad we went to Anchor to try it. Delicious. Crab, shrimp, mussels, fish in the tastiest tomato based soup. 

Anchor is family owned and you can tell in it&apos;s quality. I can&apos;t wait until family members come visit who love seafood - this is the place to take them.

My star rating:
5  - you have to go!!! 
4 - you won&apos;t be disappointed 
3  - it was okay 
2  - I probably won&apos;t go back 
1  - turnaround and run"
5,"Anchor Oyster Bar is the real deal! This small cosy family-run restaurant serves genuinely fresh and delicious seafood and homemade well seasoned crusty bread at fair prices. So glad I came across this fabulous place! Some of the best seafood I&apos;ve ever experienced. And the service was very efficient and friendly.

Was told I will never go wrong ordering cioppino and also decided to try crab Ceaser salad.
The cioppino was outstanding, hands down. The portion was too big with lots of crab legs, huge prawns,mussels and clams in an incredibly tasty and thick sauce, so their amazing garlic bread to dip inside it is a must. I even decidd to a get a 16oz jar for myself. No regret!
The salad was also good, with freshest lettuce and delicious dressing. It was homemade too, I assume.

Overall basing on my takeout experience 5 stars is the lowest mark I can give. Will definitely go back!"
5,"This place is a classic for a reason - it&apos;s THE place to go in SF for cioppino. Pre-Covid it was nearly impossible to get in to eat here because it&apos;s tiny inside and you would write your name on the board and wait until they called you. Now, with Covid they have a really cute little parklet with a roof and windows where you can sit outside and eat, as well as takeout. Last time I went with my roommate and we decided to go all out and get the anchor special, the small cioppino, and a white wine they recommended. Anchor special was a great appetizer and the clams come with a sauce you want to soak all the garlic bread in. They accidentally made us a large cioppino (how sad right?) so we lucked out and got to dive into a massive tray of tons of fresh mussels, clams, shrimp, and crab in a sauce I wanted to swim in. We ended up ordering another plate of garlic bread because it&apos;s perfectly toasty, cheesy, and garlicy and it&apos;s a crime to not sop up all the cioppino broth with it. They will also kindly put all the remaining cioppino broth into a to go plastic container so we were able to use it on pasta later in the week. Another tip is to check out the daily specials as you can&apos;t go wrong with those either!"
5,"Even more charming, now with the shuttered parklet seating area.
The food still is the best, so fresh, so perfectly prepared. And having the option of having our food to-go means we can go home and have a terrific meal from one of our favorites places, and be well fed.
Enjoy!"
1,"So... decided to come here after googling seafood places, and due to so many reviews, decided to try it. Waited for an hour to be seated, and then another hour waited for our food. 
Ordered crab cakes and they were delicious. Very perfectly made. Also Chopino is like $50 but it is not as flavorful as mentioned in other comments. 
The restaurant is clean and service is great, they are trying but literally hire more staff so people don&apos;t have to wait for hours to get their food."
5,"While this seafood restaurant and bar might be small...its really big on fresh seafood!  The pristinely clean restaurant is simple with a nice touch of whimsical ocean and boating decor. There is a small bar with about 6 seats, and maybe 6 small tables, so don&apos;t show up here with more than 4 people...better make that 2, or a solo date!  

$23 Black Mussels...perfectly steamed and soaked in a light and beautiful buttery tomato broth. Be sure to soak up that sensational seafood sauce with sourdough!

$7 Boston Clam Chowder...rich, thick, creamy, and heavenly packed with clams."
4,"Their heat lamps saved us while we dined outdoors on a chilly night. To start off, we got their Oysters (which can be ordered each, or by half or a full dozen), which was a mixture of both East and West coast origins. They were fresh and sweet. Even my friend who does not like oysters enjoyed them! Then we ordered the Small Cioppino and Linguine and Clams. Their portions are huge... these were more than enough to feed 3 hungry people. To be honest, I prefer cioppino from another famous restaurant in SF due to their rich broth. The linguini was also a bit salty, but we finished all of the dishes regardless. Nothing much to say about the service, since it was self-service. Prices are pretty high, but typical of any seafood place in the city."
5,"Even after coming here for the first time over 8 years ago, I still love coming here. If you love seafood this place is a must try, just be prepared for a wait since the place doesn&apos;t seat many people. 

The best items are the steam shellfish, I usually as for a side of pasta or order garlic bread. The ciopinno is my favorite dish here or if they have a special pasta of the day. 

The service still remains the same, I wish this place was closer to where I live so I could come here more often."
5,"Why 5 stars? Because this was such an enjoyable experience.

After landing at SFO, I was in a Lyft to my hotel and start doing a little research on what I&apos;d like to eat for dinner. I thought of a couple options ahead of time, but upon looking into those, found out that they were both closed on Mondays. Nothing super close to my hotel seemed that appealing, so I opted to call an audible and change my destination to The Castro so that I could finally visit Anchor. 

I also read about some pretty gnarly wait times here, so I was happy to have arrived at 5:30p. As soon as I walked up, I wrote my name down on the dry erase board. I ended up waiting around 20-25 minutes for a single seat at the bar, but if I had walked up like 30 seconds earlier, that wait would have only been about half that. And if I&apos;d arrived a bit later, I would have had no wait at all because the seat on my left was open the entire time I was eating. Moral of the story: arrive at off-peak times and in a small group!

I was a bit nervous that my suitcase would be bothersome to people because the restaurant is so small, but I found room in between myself and the guy next to me at the bar. My backpack hung under the bar where purses would typically go.

As for the food, I had time to stalk the menu while I waited and was ready to recite my selections as soon as I sat down. But then I saw the specials. Crab burger? Scallop Appetizer? Shellfish pasta? Argh! No, no... this is what we practiced for - just order what you came for!

After that internal pep talk, I did order what I came for: clam chowder, oysters and the crab cake appetizer. All were wonderful. I wasn&apos;t starving when I arrived, so this really hit the spot. The clam chowder was super creamy and among the best I&apos;ve ever had. I still don&apos;t know enough about oysters to know what I like in them - I just know that I always enjoy them. And &apos;always&apos; includes this visit. Finishing up with the crab cake appetizer - it was like butter. And the house made tartar sauce was rich and delicious. I washed it all down with a Headlands Hefeweizen, which was the absolute perfect compliment to this meal.

As great as the food was, the people were even better. I interacted with at least three front-of-house folks and they were all so warm and lovely - definitely more than you&apos;ll typically experience. It felt more like you were in someone&apos;s home and they really wanted to make sure you enjoyed your visit. I really appreciated that and will forever be a fan of Anchor for that reason alone."
5,"Okay then, it is high time i write a review of this place as I&apos;ve dined here before and since Covid.  The quality of the steamed mussels &amp; scallops remains unchanged &amp; delicious.  
Sadly, they are currently operating on a reduced menu, but i was happy my favorite mussel is on the list.  The girlfriend has a photo of me slurping down the bowl of mussel broth in the pre-Covid days.  Mmmm, so good.  
Obviously, they do takeaway &amp; there are 4 or 5 tables on a 1st come 1st served basis.  
I must say that I prefer the views of the blvd from the sidewalks over sitting shoulder to shoulder in the cramped dining room, but the downside of outdoor dining is the food gets cold quicker even in the middle of July"
4,"I love this restaurant and have been eating here for many years. Everything is very fresh. I order the cioppino a lot, the oysters, clam chowder and the crab cocktail but this last time a really incredible sea bass. Also like the service that Alex provides.

Update:  took a star off for the poor service from the new server with red hair.  Still love the food though."
5,"How have I not been here before?! The seafood is amazing, the atmosphere is  inviting, the decor is on point. Yes, it is a small restaurant so be prepared  to wait. And don&apos;t leave - because they will pass you by if you&apos;re not there when they call your name.

But it&apos;s soo worth it. We had the scallops appetizer (special item) that was cooked to perfection. The oysters hit the spot ($3.50 a piece). And the cioppino...the &quot;small&quot; was big enough for two with leftovers! And make sure you order the garlic bread to dip into all of that yummy sauce.

Even though the space is small, the wait staff are so friendly and accommodating. Mary Ann/May is so  knowledgeable and Jade made sure to keep our drinks filled and napkins coming. 

Such a great, local, family-owned spot!"
5,"I was staying in the neighborhood with my auntie and craving seafood, so our airbnb hosts&apos; recommended Anchor. I&apos;m really glad we took their advice! The walk up window was super easy to order from, with covid safety precautions in place. We each ordered clams, shared a Caesar salad and half order of garlic bread. Plenty of food for two people. The lettuce was extremely fresh, not a single browned or wilted piece. The dressing was clearly homemade and executed perfectly, with giant fresh croutons. The bread was well seasoned and the half order is 4 large pieces. The clams stole the show though; the broth was one of the most flavorful ones I&apos;ve ever enjoyed in my life! Perfectly cooked clams, no grit, delicious broth with shaved garlic and tons of lemon. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to recommend you try Anchor Oyster Bar!"
5,"It&apos;s all about the cioppino... best in SF.. freshest of seafood and an epic sauce..but I am disappointed that they only give you a ladle, as a straw would be very helpful. 

Expect a wait as they don&apos;t take reservations 


It&apos;s covid time and they are BACK! Still the best Cioppino in SF!! And might even be better as the sauce continues to evolve as you take it home. Don&apos;t forget the extra garlic bread... you can thank me later"
4,"Cute little oyster bar... the place does have very limited number of tables and seats so it takes a while to get seated. We put our name on the waitlist around 4:30 and we had to still wait about an hour to get a table for 4. 

We got a dozen oysters and it came with 3 different varieties. The clam chowder is very creamy. And the cioppino was in a thicker tomato base sauce with perfectly cooked mussels, clams, massive shrimp, and crab.

They give you a plastic bin to wear to prevent any unwanted stains.

Parking is metered street"
5,"Hands down the best cioppino in the entire bay area. Small is good for 2 people, large for 3. The garlic bread (2pcs) that comes out with cioppino is buttery, crispy, flavorful. I sometimes order small cioppino and garlic bread half order for 3 people.

Anchor specials (12 oysters, 8 steamed clams, 4 chilled prawns) is worth trying as well. Oysters and prawns are fresh and delicious. My favorite is steamed clams. It is seasoned with winey, olive oily, garlicy broth and tastes delicious.

Oyster shooters are great appetizer.

I would recommend to come off-lunch/dinner time to avoid a long wait."
5,"I tried to come here a couple years ago, but they were undoing renovation so it was closed. Went hiking at Muir Woods on Labor Day so I wanted to take my mom somewhere &quot;SF&quot; for lunch since she never goes on her own. Called in to make sure they were open, and sure enough, they were!

Arrived around 1:30 and there was quite a wait. We had to put our name down and the time we arrived. After an hour of waiting we were finally seated. Between the two of us we ordered the Anchor sampler half order and the small cioppino.  The Anchor sampler was such a great deal! We received 6 oysters (3 different types), 2 large prawns, and steamed clams. My mom doesn&apos;t really like oysters but she really enjoyed all three of these. The broth for the steamed clams was so unique... SUPER good. As for the cioppino... it was AMAZING! One of the best ones I&apos;ve had :) The small was plenty for the both of us... we ended up taking half home. I hate when the cioppino&apos;s have really thick sauce/broth, but this was was perfectly liquid-y and dense in flavor.

There&apos;s only one person who takes the order (wearing a white shirt) and a few others refilling drinks and clearing tables (wearing black shirts). A pretty good system here IMO. 

Definitely worth a try and certainly worth the wait.

P.S. The garlic bread is to die for!"
5,"If you&apos;re in San Francisco and visiting the Castro district, this classic staple in the Castro is a must to go! 

It&apos;s a tiny place, which most of the time has a wait, because it&apos;s so good!!!

I went to have a quick lunch with my friend and I ordered the crab cakes. I love crab cakes wherever I go and always love having them as a starter. 

The crab cakes were pretty damn big! Also, there was so much crab  in the cakes! They were seasoned perfectly and crispy on the outside, yet moist and flavourful on the inside! I squeezed some fresh lemon on top and devoured them! Because of the side of the crab cakes, which I didn&apos;t share with my friend  I wasn&apos;t too hungry after. 

I then ordered the clam chowder. The clam chowder was so incredibly creamy and again, with chunks of clam, potatoes,etc! I must say I was incredibly full and pleased after just having two items. I know o didn&apos;t share, but my friend has the exact same order! 

Again if you&apos;re in the mood for some great seafood and in the Castro this is a place to go and a must! Well worth the wait!"
5,"If you want to try one of the best cioppono in San Francisco, here you are. Attention! The portions are very large, you need to take one for at least two.
You can also choose other seafood dishes and oysters of course. Bon appetit!"
5,"Long wait, no reservations allowed, but all worth it in the end. I loved their crab blue cheese wedge salad and their infamous cioppino. Their tomato based cioppino was filled with crab, mussels, clams, and shrimp topped with a very toasty piece of French bread. One of the best in the city! I&apos;m getting hungry just writing this review."
