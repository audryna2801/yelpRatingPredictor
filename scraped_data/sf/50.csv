5,"My memories of HRD are wrapped up tightly in their spicy pork kimchi burritos. 

The year was 2010, before the sushirittos and the senior sisigs, and the San Francisco Giants, fresh from their first World Series in a long time, decided to host a Fan Day. Fans from all over the Bay Area, clad in Buster Posey jerseys and snuggled SF scarves, flocked to AT&amp;T Park in hopes of getting Tim Lincecum to sign a regular baseball, rendering it special. 

My dad first suggested we head to HRD, after all, it was on our way to the ballpark and I liked burritos as any kid would. I remember my first bite of the spicy pork burrito (it barely fit in my tiny hands) was on the third deck of AT&amp;T. It blew me away, it was that delicious. From that point on, baseball games became intertwined with HRD burritos. 

That is why, when they went through remodeling and renovations, there was something missing from my SF Giants experience. When they reopened, I busted through their doors and ordered my favorite burrito once again. I was reunited, and happy.

While my love goes out to the spicy pork burrito, I have also fancied the bulgogi beef kimchi burrito as well, and crave their pickles! Great fast-casual eating all around."
5,"Ordered take out the other day. Very yummy fusion of Mexican, Korean + Japanese. I tried bites of three (bulgogi, shrimp, and tofu). They were all delicious. Typical at prices but they are stuffed heavily so I am full at the end. 

Bulgogi beef: My favorite!! the kiwis add an interesting sweetness. It tastes great with the two sauces. Tender bulgogi (a tad salty) with a decent amount stuffed in burrito. 

Shrimp: 3.5/5 - there was a lot of fry and a little shrimp... There was only around 3-4 shrimps and with most being the batter, it didn&apos;t taste much like shrimp. The smothered sauce (curry) was very good. Tastes just like classic Japanese curry. 

Tofu: 5/5 - the spicy tofu was delicious! nothing else really needs to be said. This may be on the same level as the bulgogi burrito. I love bulgogi, but may consider ordering this in the future instead one day. Crispy tofu on the outside."
5,"Ordered for delivery last week, and it was just as amazing as the first time I&apos;ve gone. The kimchi aioli is SO good I ordered two separate bottles on the side.

We ordered the shrimp, tofu, chicken, bulgogi, and fish burritos and they were ALL delicious. Flavor was on point, and it&apos;s a good fusion of different cuisines. 

Not to mention, my previous time coming here in person, the staff are all super polite and friendly. Highly recommended for those looking for a different spin on a burrito!"
4,"I remember when the food truck craze started. Everyone wanted to be the next Kogi Taco Truck from SoCal. The Creme Brulee Guy was serving out of a literal cart on Mission. Boom. Then there was HRD. One of the popular fusion Korean spots to go to in SF and glad they&apos;re still around. 

I used to work a few blocks away and frequented this spot for lunch and I always picked up one of these beef bulgogi kimchi burritos to bring to the ball game 

Great flavor, generous serving of beef and that Wasabi sauce adds another level."
2,"SERVICE: Came around 3 on a holiday/Monday and there was no one there. We tried calling in the order beforehand, but neither of the numbers worked. so Took about 5 minutes for them to assemble the burritos after ordering, so that was a plus! 

LOCATION: Located away from the huddle and bustle of downtown so there&apos;s ample parking near the spot. You order from the window because of COVID. 

FOOD: We were pretty excited because the reviews were popping and Asian fusion usually hits, but the overall  experience was pretty whatever. We tried the bulgogi and spicy pork. The burritos aren&apos;t really stacked so they&apos;re not too big. The meat was dry, so the whole burrito tasted pretty dry. There also isn&apos;t too much of the meat in there, so you mostly get a bite of rice. The included red sauce helped a little, but it was still just ok. For $24, you could get a much better tasting and filling meal at another establishment in the city. 

I wouldn&apos;t come back because it wasn&apos;t worth the price to me. Be the judge yourself!"
4,"I&apos;ve been wanting to try this place for awhile and I&apos;m so glad I did! It&apos;s a twist of Korean and Mexican food in one! I came here on a Monday right at opening so it was no wait. The ordering process is super convenient and you can order everything online! The sucky part might be is parking. I noticed many of the meters close by were loading zone only so just be careful! 
Anyways, my sister and I shared the Bulgogi burrito and it&apos;s a pretty meaty burrito and will get you full! I definitely would love to try other burritos again or perhaps some yummy tacos!"
4,"I was very surprised this place has so many reviews! So we thought we should try it, we got the popular beef burritos, I knew it was different but really not what I had Envisioned. I probably wouldn&apos;t go away but it was okay! Yummy wasabi sauce"
1,"Here is a copy of my receipt.
Food tastes old and nasty
Please don&apos;t sell left overs 
Upon arrival I worded the food and it was done in about a minute. Too fast and not good. Do you think people won&apos;t notice is the food is old?"
3,"Ordered during COVID. Got the chicken and the pork burritos. It&apos;s a nice Korean twist on burrito.  Not sure if they make them smaller for Ub Feast delbut portion was a bit on the small side. It&apos;s fine if you&apos;re trying to keep your figure, but wasn&apos;t quite enough for my husband."
1,"1. Rice was undercooked and tasted like it was from a school cafeteria out of a sack of aluminum foil. 

2. Owner was quite rude. *post-covid review* Called in to place an order and the owner promptly asked why I didn&apos;t come into the store to order like everyone else and that this was precisely the reason why they set up a table. 

*hint* because every other restaurant in the nation takes an order over the phone. 

considering how you reply to any review less than 3 stars and quote Pete Moynihan, go ahead and reply. I won&apos;t waste the time reading it.&quot;"
1,"I had been wanting to try this place for a long time. However, I was severely disappointed. Bland food. Got the chicken smothered burrito. The inside was dry popcorn chicken, dry brown rice, and a little bit of kimchi. The sauce was not enough to save it. Honestly surprised there are positive reviews for this.

Edit: the owner weirdly verbally attacked me in the replies??? I know the restaurant is critically acclaimed, that&apos;s why I wanted to try it. Also, I ordered on caviar, so your claim that your team member &apos;politely explained&apos; how to order a burrito is simply not true??? The sauces weren&apos;t bad, but more of the sauces would not have fixed dry and bland popcorn chicken and rice inside a tortilla. I felt like I was eating leftovers from my elementary school cafeteria (with some nice sauce on top). Sorry. Also, I respect and appreciate essential workers in the restaurant industry. However, I doubt it&apos;s your employees fault that your recipe and ingredients were disappointing. 

Finally, I think it&apos;s a little extreme to attack any negative reviews about your product as I see you&apos;ve done with other poor reviews. It&apos;s okay that not everyone likes your food. No one is trying to slander you, hope your regulars continue to support you during these trying times.

And why would I want to come back? Lol"
5,"Ordered the Bulgogi Beef Kim Chi Burrito 

You walk in and the menu is directly to your left. Plenty of vegetarian options and different versions of food. Either you want your order in a burrito, a wrap, on rice, on a salad or Banh mi. You got options. 

Place wasn&apos;t packed and  plenty of space for groups of people or going solo. There is alcoholic options if you want a drink here as well. A bathroom is also on the premises.

The bulgogi beef Kim chi burrito is about 6&quot; long and smaller than a bottle of water but it was phenomenal! It was made fairly quickly and delicious. 

Would highly recommend coming here and will be coming back"
5,"HRD was and remains one of my fav eatery in Soma.  Covid precautions are exceptional as well.  

If you love fusion food reminiscent of Hawaiian Asian flavors...chicken rice bowl with healthy vegetables, spicy poke salad, or bulgogi burrito, definitely worth it.  And supporting our neighborhood businesses who feed us yummy foods in good and current times rewarding."
5,"Okay, HRD has spectacular reviews for a reason. Simply order at the counter and then take a seat. The food is not too heavy and there&apos;s a good range of items to choose from.

Food ordered:

1. Bulgogi Kimchee Burrito (5/5): This was the highlight of this trip. The bulgogi was cooked and cut into small pieces. The filling was a great assortment of flavors: Korean daikon, kimchee, rice,  and kiwi.

2. Spicy Pork Bahn Mi Wrap (3/5): I was excited to try the bahn mi wrap since I didn&apos;t see a lot of reviews on it. Personally, it was good but I was not a super fan of the amount of pickled carrots in the wrap. The wrap basically consists of a tortilla with pickled carrots, which were a bit too sour for my pallete, and the spicy pork.

3. Fries (4/5): The fries were curly! Yes, curly fries! There were crunchier pieces and softer ones, but all were perfectly golden and crunchy on the outside. Paired with the spicy mayo sauce that comes with the appetizer, this was delicious."
5,"Slow service but the food is worth it. Its spicy but delicious. My go to meal every time I&apos;m in SF is the shrimp katsu curry platter. The wasabi coleslaw balances the spice. I normally get sick from mayo but have been fine with their coleslaw. They throw in a fried round orange-colored disk with the plate that&apos;s not listed in the menu, and it tastes great but I just wish I knew what it was for allergy reasons and so I could order it at other places. The curry is slightly spicier then I can handle, but it is delicious enough that it is worth it. For reference I have a lower spice tolerance than most. I did not like the burrito I tried nearly as much, but my coworkers liked them. During Covid they reduced their hours so they are only open for lunch and early dinners weekdays, which is disappointing. I wish they were a west coast chain."
4,"I can confirm that the other 2K reviews are on target. ;-)

Tried the bulgogi burrito and it was really delicious. The fruit component was interesting and worked well for me. I wanted to try everything on the menu, will be back. Was surprised that this small spot had a pretty good amount of seating if you want to not do take-out."
4,"I tried the Crispy Chicken with Curry and the Bulgogi Beef Burrito. The Chicken by itself was kind of bland, I think it needed more seasoning. The majority of the flavor was coming from the curry. I really liked the wasabi sauce they used to dress the coleslaw/give on the side. Wasabi sauces usually burn too much for me, but this one paired really nicely with the curry. 

For the bulgogi beef burrito, the beef was flavored well and the vegetables inside were a refreshing contrast to the meat. One thing that I think would be an improvement would be having the option to get white rice subbed in for the brown rice (they only use brown rice from what I&apos;ve seen). I feel the price is reasonable and I wouldn&apos;t mind coming here semi-regularly for a quick lunch."
2,"Pretty disappointed given all the hype around this restaurant. My friends and I walked in for a quick bite on our way to the theatre: two of us got the pork rice plate and the other had the fish tacos. They were all super meh. Specifically with the pork, the meat was sort of fatty but over cooked, making for a gummy texture. It didn&apos;t mesh well with the somewhat congealed rice and completely bland &quot;pickled&quot; vegetables. The sauce was mildly redeeming with its flavor, but it was too creamy to be applied liberally in any way. Other than the food, the service was fast, portions decently sized, but still a bit pricey (maybe will cut them a break considering their good location in SF though).

Really wanted to love this place but unfortunately not!"
4,"Came here on a Friday evening. No wait, no lines and plenty going on in the menu. Ordered the Kim chee beef bulgogi burrito. It was oook. I like the sweet from the kiwi and the salty from the beef. Came with a side of wasabi sauce. Added taste.  It wasn&apos;t as big compared to what my husband ordered. He had the smothered burrito crispy chicken. Well that&apos;s what you call a wet burrito and it was mad smothered with Japanese curry sauce. It all sounds like a bunch of ingredients nicely combined to make a delicious burrito. It was so good I had to trade with my hubs! I killed it! So fried chicken with brown rice and Kim chee with Japanese curry sauce. Sounds crazy and it is... crazy good!"
4,"Awesome quality food! The bulgogi burrito is amazing, and the eggplant katsu wet burrito (with curry sauce) is my favorite. There&apos;s something so deliciously unique with the eggplant katsu. I actually prefer it over the chicken. 

The food was prepared quickly, but I either come before the lines start and when the lines end. I also like how everything you need from napkins to to-go containers are neatly available in one spot. 

There&apos;s no service because you order at the front, and they&apos;ll take the food to you (you&apos;ll clear your dishes yourself to the bins). 

This place has both great quality food and quantity portions. Good for a quick bite to eat at a decent price for San Francisco."
