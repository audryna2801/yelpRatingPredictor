5,"Jay was amazing! He did a magic session for a team building session over Zoom. His tricks were mind-blowing. I&apos;m really impressed that he was able to convert his live, in-person act act into a funny, engaging virtual event that captivated 30 people. Great job, Jay!"
5,"This magician is so professional and mind blowing and funny and kind that it is always a delight to see his  excellence and enjoy his superb performances!
Jay Alexander is our favorite magician ever!!
And his show is astonishly right for all ages. Very inspiring to see a high level of craft delivered with suich heart ."
5,Wow! I am typically skeptical of magic but Jay had me smiling from ear to ear and ultra engaged for a full hour. His show will leave you asking &quot;how on Earth did he do that!&quot;
5,"Whoa. I gotta admit that when our team decided to do a zoom magic show I thought it would be really tough to be wow&apos;d. I was so happy to be wrong. What a show! This was a ton of fun, super interactive, highly recommend Jay!"
5,"Jay did a virtual magic show for my team. It was excellent! He is a great magician and mathematician (seriously, so quick!). Would highly recommend."
5,"My girlfriend and I had a great time with Jay&apos;s virtual Valentine&apos;s Day magic show. For future reference, whenever Jay is selling a ticket to something, you should buy it!"
5,"This is the real deal.  Jay is an amazing magician and we were in shock and awe!

The magic is so good I think Jay might actually be an actual wizard!

If you&apos;re in the area, this is perfect for a special evening!"
5,"My mind was blown for the first time ever. I was skeptical at the beginning of the show, he was really engaging and his sense of humor is classy. I&apos;m definitely bringing all of my skeptical friends to this show. It is well organized. I can&apos;t stop talking about the show to my friends and family."
5,"Came here last Saturday night with a friend and my boyfriend, and wow, was it a fantastic show! We arrived early and the magician, Jay Alexander, greeted us and led us to the lounge area, where he did magic for all parts of the room! This started around 8:30. We ordered some mint tea which was okay, though I&apos;d be interested to try the food if I came back. The theater is small, most beautifully decorated and provides a nice, intimate experience where everyone can participate in the show. So much fun! I definitely think it would be enjoyable to see the show again and bring my family! Jay is super personable and funny, and has an inspiring story he shared with us at the end as well. He was free to talk and take pictures with in the lobby after the show. A must see in San Francisco!"
5,"Support our local performers!!  These small-time venues are disappearing so fast and it&apos;s a true treasure to experience an intimate performace such as this one.  

We go to the City every Christmas for a show (Lion King, Volta, Christmas Carol, etc.) with 4 families - our kids said this was definitely one of the best, and the grown-ups agreed!  Jay will keep you on the edge of your seat - amongst the 14 of us, we could not figure out one of his &quot;tricks&quot;.

Hopefully you get a good crowd - we had some morons out to prove Jay wrong - they failed.  But the theater is very intimate - your chances of being a part of the show seem to fall on being close to the aisle; there is a back corner with multiple seats - you won&apos;t get called on to participate if you&apos;re seated there (at least our anxious young girls didn&apos;t get called on).  Maybe Jay decides in the pre-show lobby performance - show up for this if you can!  The kids loved it.  

We went super busy Christmas time - parking was horrible.  Give yourself plenty of time.  Enjoy!!"
5,"The hype with this place is real. 
I was super skeptical with this place and imagined this to be an overpriced tourist trap but it wasn&apos;t!
The show is amazing and the whole audience is engaged.  
Photography is allowed during the show but I still couldn&apos;t figure out how he did all his tricks.
Jay is very passionate about what he does and I will be excited to come back again to watch the show again (even if it&apos;s the same exact show!)."
5,I came here with my sister several years ago over the summer. My sister and I enjoyed every minute here with Jay. He is quite the genius magician. There was no fooling him. I also loved the setting which took place underground and was almost like a small 1950s nightclub.
5,"This was absolutely a magical experience! Come whether you are a fan or a skeptic; fans will be fascinated and skeptics will be convinced that it&apos;s not just that some audience members are &quot;in&quot; for the magic to work.

My boyfriend recently became interested in magic so I booked two tickets for a show on Thursday night for us. Get here 30 minutes or more early! You can order food and drinks before the show, and Jay does some card tricks close up for every table. We got the shish kebab (tasted really good, especially the tomato sauce salad!), a Corona beer, and a Moroccan Magic cocktail (which was actually pretty strong; I&apos;m sure it didn&apos;t influence my perception of the rest of the night too much though ;) ). The close-up magic really set the tone for an intimate and fun night of magic. I thought having the pre-show snacks and close-up magic was a great idea as it allowed those of us who got here early to enjoy ourselves while others who were running a little late had time to get here and still see the whole main show.

I don&apos;t want to spoil the show too much, but know that there are no bad seats and plenty of opportunities to volunteer so you can&apos;t come out of the show thinking that other audience members were just &quot;in&quot; on the magic! I highly recommend booking your tickets to experience the magic!"
5,"What a GREAT show, story, experience. Perfect combination of magic, comedy, and entertainment. The smaller room and audience is so awesome. You feel like you&apos;re part of the show and Jay gets a lot of individual audience members involved. His tricks are legit. 

Get there early. There are appetizers and drinks available before the show and Jay makes his way around the waiting area and does some card tricks. 

Probably ~30-40 people per show so it&apos;s a small setting and you get great views of all the tricks. 

Go, tell al your friends, and support Jay and local theatre!"
5,"What a hidden gem in the city! We came here with a group of friends (we weren&apos;t sure what to expect) and we had a wonderful time! 
Everyone was incredibly friendly from the moment we walked down the stairs and entered into the world of magic  I definitely recommend getting there 30-45 minutes early and having a drink in the side room. The magician comes around before the show and engages with every group for fun, up-close card tricks and amusement. 
The show lasted about an hour and a half and was really well done - everyone in the entire group had a great time and three of us were even chosen to participate in different parts of his performance. 
This place deserves 5 stars  and we will definitely be back!"
5,"This was a totally, wonderful surprise.

I was invited to go to the Theater and Dinner; My friends would not mention what Show or Theater. I  still was clueless when we arrived at the Marrakech Magic Theater. I was born and raised in San Francisco and have never heard of it...sure the restaurant but not the theater.

In a word Go!!!! 

The Marrakech Magic Theater hosting Jay Alexander is perfect for anyone 8-80. 

The event is in two parts:
First you are escorted to a very chill Moroccan influenced area where you can order drinks and snacks. Jay, the magician, performs interactive card tricks with the audience.....Amazing and funny tricks that will blow your mind.
The second part is where you are escorted to a small cute theater where Jay performs his amazing mind tricks. It is funny, cute, clever, amazing, dumbfounding, and inspirational. The hour or so will breeze by so fast you wish it would go on.

Jay is a wonderful magician (whatever you want to call him). His message at the end about having dyslexia and a speech impediment and overcoming these obstacles to become a  World class performer, traveling with the Rolling Stones, dignitaries, cruises, conventions was truly inspirational for all the kids in the audience ( including this big kid). His message: You can do anything you set your mind to do.

I would highly recommend this for kids. All the kids in the audience had participation and they totally enjoyed it."
5,This is a lovely place to bring a family. This may be the last regular live show running in SF. Magic IS better in an intimate setting. Jay Alexander is the consummate host and entertainer. You can tell that he loves performing magic. The location is in the Union Square neighborhood. The mint tea is delicious.
5,"Its top rated for a reason! Went with the reviews and bought tickets for our anniversary night, and it was just amazing ! We arrived promptly at 5:30, were seated and shown menu to order drinks or appetizers. We got a couple of drinks. There was nothing much happening until 6:10 pm, when Jay came in and started showing some cool card tricks while we were seated. At 6:30, he escorted us inside the theater and the magic started then! It was like we were a part of the show, not like a normal magic show. We were involved in the tricks, our minds getting blown away after every trick. The best part was Jay&apos;s monologue, it really moved us. We had a great evening, enjoyed every bit of the show and are going to recommend this to every friend who lives here or visits us."
5,"Believe the reviews.  Jay puts on a fantastic show.  Our minds were blown, and we spent the entire hour-long ride home trying to figure out how he did what he did.  

The show is good for kids and adults, so it&apos;s an excellent option for families.  The cost is also reasonable, and you get personal access to the performer (one who has worked with or for Robin Williams and the Rolling Stones).

Highly, highly recommend Jay&apos;s magic show.  You won&apos;t regret it."
5,"I wonder how come I haven&apos;t discovered this earlier.
It was one of a kind experience. We loved every minute of the show. I have so much respect for Jay&apos;s talent and hard work.
The venue was so perfect, very small, where everyone gets to participate.

We found the best ticket price on Goldstar (at other sites there was always a service fee)."
