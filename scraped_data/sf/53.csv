5,"Super old bay. 

Felt compelled to show some love as Swan Oyster Depot is still rockin during Covid. 

Husband picked up a bay shrimp louie for us to split for lunch on his way home from work. $20 out the door. SOD does an impeccable job of packing up their seafood products to go while being environmentally concise. The salad, separate container of dressing and bread stayed perfectly intact and without blemish in its sturdy paper wrapping. Pro job. 

High quality seafood doesn&apos;t smell fishy or taste fishy. In my opinion, fresh seafood should go down the gullet like little pops of buttery heaven. Everything SOD carries is of the freshest quality. #1 thing I love about this place. 

The louie they make is simply shredded lettuce and hella bay shrimp. It&apos;s not the most frilly louie ever but the fresh shrimp makes up for the lack of veggies. Nice portion to split between two people. Excellent louie dressing. Traditional old bay dressing made with pickles or relish (can&apos;t tell which) and just the right amount of seasoning. Came with solid sourdough bread that was also very fresh. 

If you&apos;ve never been inside the vibe is great. You can tell the guys working are having hella fun."
5,"Late, but necessary review. 
Swan Oyster is cash only. I repeat, cash only. We avoided a stop at an ATM by placing an order on the Caviar app for pick-up. 

This was before they had implemented outdoor seating in front of the restaurant, so we took our order of sashimi and a dozen half shell oysters to Dolores park. 

The fellas at Swan did such a terrific job, ensuring our picnic had all the essentials--mignonette (minced shallots in vinegar), and a perfect portion of napkins and utensils. 

We paired our sashimi with Hawaiian Sweet Maui Onion chips and let me tell ya--that was the move. It paired so nicely with the assortment of fresh fish topped with bitter capers. The oysters were fresh, perfectly cleaned, and juicy too. 

I honestly have no complaints with this place. It will always be my go-to oyster spot. It even has Bourdain&apos;s blessing. RIP."
5,"Omg their seafood is so fresh even from takeout... I can&apos;t even imagine what it would taste like on the spot. I love how the portion size is not too much or big so you can try a little of everything! I did wish the combo cocktail had a little bit more of everything, I feel like they gave way too much of the mini baby shrimps but not enough oysters and everything else. But I definitely love the sashimi and scallops, so fresh and delicious  

We got:
* Sicilian Style Sashimi 
* Dozen Eggs : Thinly sliced scallops with ponzu sauce and a drop of sriracha and cayenne pepper
* Combo Cocktail : Shrimp, dungeness crab, prawn, oyster with cocktail sauce"
5,"You&apos;ll be one step closer to heaven after eating here. 

I&apos;ll let the photos speak for themselves...

Come here and you&apos;ll be a regular after the first bite. 

The service is absolutely outstanding. Friendly and you&apos;ll feel at home."
4,"This hustle and bustle is a staple in every tourist visit in SF and locals alike. Pre-covid line was way too long and they have an old fashion ordering system, no website, and cash only. But since entering covid world, this place has been evolving, from creating their official IG account to taking phone orders to outdoor dining, Swan Oyster Depot is finally making their stand into the modern world. However, this never stopped people from forgetting about this place, in fact they are still super busy even during covid. BUT coming by here on a Saturday at 1pm with no line and no wait to order was certain a major WIN in my book. 

We ordered their Sicilian Sashimi (medium), Dungeness Crab Louie Salad, and Clam Chowder. The sashimi was fresh with diced shallots, capers, freshly grounded black pepper, and drizzle of olive oil, it was missing a little salt to bring out the sweetness of the fresh fish though. The louie is nice with big fresh chunks of crab meat and quite a healthy amount of crab meat too. The lettuce is just ice berg lettuce, but the louie sauce is creamy and has a nice tang. I ended up dipping my bread into this sauce and my sashimi into this sauce too! The clam chowder unfortunately was not great and tasted a bit burnt. It was watery and just okay. Won&apos;t order this again. 

Ate these delicious seafood at a nearby park on a sunny Saturday with a bottle of rose. Pretty perfect picnic if you ask me!"
4,"Throwback to the &apos;60s and &apos;70s. Beatles and Jimi Hendrix in the background.

I&apos;ve been going here for years, and they have been doing things a certain way for many years.  The seafood is amazingly fresh and you can get a wide range from blue point oysters to salmon and cappers. 

when I lived in San Francisco I would go sit at the bar and have a nice lunch by myself, and I hardly liked eating by myself.

The only reason I&apos;m not giving them five stars is they could increase cleanliness. They must modernize here.

I noticed them not using gloves all the time to prepare dishes, and waiters not wearing their mask to cover their nose. It&apos;s a good time for them to up their game, since we are in a pandemic. 

Cash payment is the only form as well. I don&apos;t expect payment through Bitcoin, not the most convenient."
4,"Swan Oyster is a very popular spot and I only got to try it without waiting in a crazy line because of the pandemic! We got the sicilian sashimi, a dozen oysters, and a combination cocktail to go. Although they had limited outdoor seating at the restaurant, we opted for take out. I recommend calling ahead to save time.

We took the food to go and had a picnic at a nearby park. Unfortunately, the restaurant forgot to pack utensils, so we ate the sashimi, combination cocktail, and oysters with our hands. The oysters were very delicious and we decided to use the shells as utensils. The sicilian sashimi was also very good. I highly recommend you use both the lemon and the sauce. The combination cocktail was just ok, I wouldn&apos;t get it again."
4,"Day before the second round shutdown and it seemed everyone needed to get their last chance at outdoor dining in until who knows when!  So, of course, the usual line at Swan Oyster Depot was there, although six feet apart.

So here&apos;s the big phat pro tip:  
CALL YOUR ORDER IN FOR PICK UP AND THERE IS ZERO WAIT!  There are so many iconic views in SF, why wouldn&apos;t you take advantage of that?  We took our lunch to Fort Point and had an amazing view of the GG bridge.  I called my order in for pickup at 12:30pm...surpassed the line that was about ten parties deep, and was in and out in less than 5 minutes.

We ordered our usual secret menu items: Sicilian Sashimi (medium) and a dozen eggs.  Can&apos;t go wrong with those.  Very high caliber seafood! 5/5

We tried a couple other items:
- Prawn cocktail:  Nothing special here.  Although the prawns were sweet and a little on the  larger side, I could have gotten four times the amount at Costco for the same price.  3/5
- Clam chowder:  I&apos;m scratching my head at all the amazing reviews.  I read there is no recipe for their clam chowder, so maybe I got a bum batch.  Mine was watered down, very little ingredients and had a very pungent foul (maybe a couple days past its prime) taste.  1/5

I&apos;ll stick with my regulars from now on which are the cat&apos;s meow.  Cash only."
5,"Good food sometimes comes with a long wait especially on a busy road in San Francisco on a Saturday. We waited probably an hour if not a little more when an employee said to the crowd &quot;if you aren&apos;t seated by 2 we cannot take anymore tables as we share this curb with (so and so buisness) next door and will only be taking to go orders&quot; that&apos;s fair. Literally 5 minutes before our time would of been up we got seated. Service was quick, our young waiter was fantastic and so friendly despite the clearly busy day they were having. We talked to a few others that were so nice and accommodating and on our way out I stopped one of the owners and told him we were there because of Anthony Bourdain (huge fan) he told me he was a great man and had been doing there for 20-30 years. Such joy. Food was great. Everything was great. What an experience."
5,"I was craving seafood and decided to order through Caviar for lunch and just by looking at the menu, the Sicilian Style Sashimi looked so bomb that I immediately knew that I had to give it a try. I&apos;m not exaggerating when I say this, but this is seriously the best fish I&apos;ve ever had in my life, I was speechless as soon as I took my first bite. The fish tasted so fresh, beyond delicious and it had that soft buttery flavor that it was like a taste of heaven. I&apos;ve never eaten my food this slow just to savor every bite. 

The clam chowder was also hot and tasty, probably one of the best I&apos;ve had in the city as well. If you&apos;re ever in San Francisco, I highly recommend you to stop by here and try their seafood, you won&apos;t regret it and this will definitely be my go-to for Seafood from now on!"
4,"If you&apos;re a seafood lover who&apos;s looking to try local seafood, then look no further. Swan Oyster is a must while in SF. Even Phil Rosenthal featured this restaurant on his tv show. Make sure to check their hours and have cash on you before visiting. They don&apos;t take credit cards and close in the afternoon.

My favorites are their sicilian sashimi, smoked salmon, crab cocktail and clam chowder. So fresh and tasty! They currently have outdoor seating. To bypass the long wait, order to-go and enjoy at a nearby park."
5,"Five stars for seafood! Amazing spot that opens now at 8am. Usually a line but at 10 am on a Saturday no problem! We tried it all. Deviled eggs which are scallops with ponzu and siracha. Oysters mixed so you can try all they have! Boston clam chowder and the crab back. I would say you should love the crab mustard before trying the crab back. It&apos;s a delicacy&apos; that my Korean mom would love more than I... but I always love an experience! 

Order the sashimi. It&apos;s sensational Sicilian style."
3,"Okay, let me explain. 
I&apos;ve been lucky enough to have enjoyed the food from swan more then 10 times. It&apos;s always decent. Why the three stars then? Not the friendliest of people. For me, a 3 star is middle of the road. 
Seafood is of course good, but rarely do they pick up the phone if you have an order, and when I have been able to speak without its usually a man with low social skills. Repeatedly I&apos;ve come back though, because the quality is nice.... but I wish I knew another place that had good seafood salads and I&apos;d be happy to enjoy better customer care along with the food."
5,"I came here on a weekday almost year ago (just posting this review from my drafts) and was surprised by how slowly the line moved. After around 3 hours I finally got to see the inside of the restaurant and only saw about 9-10 seats at the bar which explains the long wait. 

I&apos;m so glad I made the decision to stay in line because the food was incredible. I ordered the clam chowder, Sicilian sashimi, smoked salmon, crab salad, oysters, and shrimp. Our awesome waiter was so nice and helped make recommendations. The seafood was so fresh and I actually forgot about the longest wait I&apos;ve ever waited for food. I&apos;m glad I read other Yelpers reviews because I made sure to bring cash since they only accept cash. 

Worth the wait and I can&apos;t wait to come back after COVID!"
1,"I don&apos;t like giving 1 stars so when I do, it&apos;s really bad. I would actually give this place zero stars if I could.

Cash only. No gloves. No hand washing. 100% not up to COVID health and safety standards. The person that tosses your crab salad is the same person that takes cash from your hands. I should&apos;ve thrown away the food but it was pricey so I risked it. I should&apos;ve read the hidden reviews prior to eating here because it looks like I wasn&apos;t the only one that experienced this. Watch Someone Feed Phil&apos;s SF episode -- he said it was the first time ever filming where he experienced horrible stomach ache.

I don&apos;t understand why people think this place is a SF staple -- maybe it was good back in the days when Anthony Bourdain visited, but it is sadly no longer good. There are plenty of better restaurants that follow COVID health and safety measures to support."
4,"I guess there was 1 good thing that covid brought....and it was the ability to eat at this place after living in SF for 7 years.  Did it live up to my expectations...maybe, but shit this place deserves all the love for allowing our table to be seated when they cut off the dine in line right in front of us.  The workers were nice enough to still give us the full service and were super nice about it.

Onto the food.  if you&apos;re here for oysters cool but DO YOU LOVE CLAMS?!??! If you do then order the cherrystone clams.  Its so hard to find raw clams and this place nails it right on.  For some reason their clams that day were extra sweet and delicious.  The only other place I&apos;ve been able to get raw clams was new England lobster company and they were defintely not as sweet."
5,"After living in SF for 8 years, we finally got a chance to try Swan Oyster after they started offering takeout during COVID.  I had the combination Louie salad, which is as good as advertised.  The super fresh crab and prawns had just the right amount of natural sweetness and salinity, which mixed perfectly with the Louie dressing, and the crispy lettuce added the crunch.  The portion size was definitely large enough for one person.  The bread was also excellent.  It&apos;s just too bad we didn&apos;t get to experience sitting at the counter and absorbing the ambiance."
5,"I went to get takeout from them twice during my stay in the Bay Area. I kind of like not having to wait in line. The food was still excellent and I am still obsessed with their smoked salmon. I had to get a pound on my second visit. Then I stopped by Acme bread and paired the two together. How can something so simple taste so good? 

On my first takeout visit they did not have any tables set up outside, but on my second visit just two days ago, they had three tables set up for outdoor dining. I dont think a lot of people know about it so there was no wait.    For those who still want to eat there, you can give them a call to see if they offer it on the day you are planning to go."
5,"COVID19 Review - so I have always wanted to try this place but the line has always been out the door. Once we started sheltering in place, I saw that you can take out from here. I called in my order and went to pick it up. Everyone was wearing a mask and they had my order ready. This place is CASH ONLY so make sure you bring cash (I didn&apos;t know but luckily had enough cash on me). 

I got oysters, clam chowder, the combination salad, and half a crab. All of it was amazingly FRESH! The seafood was almost sweet! Even though I had to bring the food home before I could eat it, it was still great! The oyster were SOOOOOOOOO good! Really all the seafood was amazing! The sourdough it came with was also great and i dipped it into the clam chowder. I would highly recommend doing take out from here! Also, with take out, the prices were super reasonable considering how much I ordered and how fresh everything is!"
5,"Eating at Swan Oyster depot pre-SIP meant long lines and required a lot of free time that I didn&apos;t have. So when I realized that they are now doing delivery via caviar, it was such a game changer. 

There were a few items that I wanted to try, but was sold out already; however, I felt what I ordered was a great sampling of most of their seafood offerings.

The combination cocktail - very fresh and had prawns, oysters, crab legs, and small shrimps. 

Kumamoto Oysters - had these Oysters before. Still great.

New England Clam Chowder - I was expecting this to be creamier but I definitely tasted the real clams in there. Also, they don&apos;t overwhelm the soup with too much potatoes and definitely it&apos;s clean because who likes to crunch down on grit?

Bread and butter - nice big piece of bread and cut into a claw with butter sandwiched in between. Perfect for dipping into the clam chowder.

Overall, felt incredibly blessed to be able to order food from this great SF institution."
