5,"Best off leash dog park ever. Actually, is it even considered a park? Walk way? Short hike? Freedom from the confinement&apos;s of your home? Either way, for humans and dogs this is the place to go.

I&apos;ve been here a few times with family members and my boyfriend. I&apos;ve gone from my initial visit of being fearful of my dog running away forever and never coming back to &quot;go, be free, Baby!&quot; 

Most people keep to themselves in their groups which isn&apos;t a bad thing during covid. Do be warned that there are folks who come here and not wear a mask. 

There&apos;s a beach in the area too that you&apos;re able to walk down to, but the walk back up can be pretty difficult so think it through before you commit. 

Overall, good park. Poop bags really only by the entrance so grab one if you&apos;re sure your dog&apos;s gonna do their thang here."
5,"Probably the nicest dog beach I have been to so far! The trails and beaches are cleaner than any human and dog-on-leash park I have ever been to.

Parking - Half the spots were open on Saturday 10AM.

Separated into two sections: 

Beach: The stairs down to to the beach and back up to the parking lot are super steep. Get ready to work out and treat yourself at the end of it all. Even the dogs struggle a little. The coastline is serene and calming with tons of photo opportunities. It&apos;s only a 1-mile roundtrip but the incline is very steep.

Trail: Less gruesome incline, shorter, hotter, and further away from the ocean. Many more dogs are zipping around in this area."
5,"So many doggies and puppies! Can we say cuteness overload? This is a great place to venture off for the views, walks and beach stroll.  We came on a gorgeous fall morning. Clear blue skies and the sun was out but work had that SF chilly weather. Dress in layers..there are times where it felt warm but then all of the sudden the wind hits you. Plenty of parking, there are portable pottys. Bring wipes or hand sanitizers. Great place to picnic on the beach if you&apos;re into that."

very nice food stotre reedom from the confinement&apos;s of your home? Either way, for humans and dogs this is the place to go."
5,"If you have a dog, you need to come here immediately. Fort Funston is DOG HEAVEN! Everyone here had a dog (or several). I was impressed at how well-behaved the dogs were and my pup made a few friends.

First, what to expect / what to wear - it&apos;s a beach, but it&apos;s more like a hike, so dress appropriately! Athleisure is perfect, and comfortable sneakers. Also, make sure to bundle up, because even in the summer it&apos;s cold and WINDY. Sunglasses are a must to protect your eyes from the sand and wind.

Now, getting there / parking - just put Fort Funston in your GPS or google maps and you&apos;ll find it easily. Arrived at 11:30 am on a Saturday morning and discovered that parking surprisingly isn&apos;t an issue because there&apos;s a huge parking lot. Even when we left an hour later there were still a lot of spots available.

Bathrooms - the only bathrooms I saw were porta potties at the large parking lot, so plan accordingly to avoid having to use these.

The main trail is paved and easy to navigate. There&apos;s lots of side trails too if you want to explore, and a steep slope down to a beach as well. Plenty of water fountains and bowls for your pup, but we brought our own too. Lots of dogs off-leash, but kept mine on a leash because he&apos;s an escape artist, and he still had a great time.

If you&apos;re hungry after, west lake center has some dog-friendly eating options like blue line pizza, and is only 5 minutes away. Can&apos;t wait to come back!"
5,"Best place to kick back and read a book. If you have a lot on your mind and just need a calming place to relax I would highly recommend you coming to Fort Funston.

The last time I went I met Max, a gorgeous German Shepperd that was so well behaved his owners had him off the leash! 

This is definitely a great spot if you have a dog and want to show him a good day : )"
4,"COVID-19 precautions. Popular. Dog friendly. Scenic. Fun hiking. See below for more info: 

COVID-19 precautions: 
People are wearing masks with the exception of a few runners. Parties give each other physical distancing. 

Popular: 
For Funston is a popular hiking area in the city. There are a few parking spots which quickly get taken on the weekends and then cars park on the road. Additional parking is available across the street around Lake Merced. To avoid crowds, I recommend a weekday morning hike. 

Dog friendly: 
Fort Funston is dog friendly. I did an early morning hike and easily saw over a dozen dogs. There is a grass area where many furry friends run around without a leash. 

Scenic: 
Fort Funston is scenic. You can take the beach trail and enjoy the waves, or the battery trail for the trees and nature. 

Fun hiking: 
There are two main trails which are neither too long nor too short. Both can be done in an hour with your household, furry friends or solo."
5,"Beautiful park. Lots of dog walkers. 

Highly recommend for a morning away from people in a beautiful oceanside setting. There was ample parking when we visited on a Monday morning, although I imagine it can get busy on a nice weekend. 

Plenty of trails to choose from so you don&apos;t have to be close to others. Three questionable but practical port-a-potties. Just close your eyes and try not to breathe and you&apos;ll be fine, though I think the cool air suppresses the smell. 

I will definitely be coming back here. 

PS: for those not familiar with NorCal beaches, the water is cold."
5,"Doggy Heaven. Favorite dog beach ever. Lots of parking. Huge place to explore. 

Should check weather conditions before coming. My first time here was v foggy so we couldn&apos;t see much but it was still a blast. 

2nd time it was clear skies but sooo windy. Still a blast though. 

There are porta potties by the parking lot."
5,"I was going to visit this place a long time ago. Because of the isolation period (not the best reason) I found free time and went to Fort Funston. This is an amazing park to hike and see the wonderful Pacific ocean views. Yeah, by the way, there is a big hill to climb back but it&apos;s worth it, trust me. It&apos;s also very dog friendly, no! I&apos;d say that this is basically like a big dog park on the beach! SO MANY DOGS! There I felt lonely without a four legged friend:( But if I had a dog, assure you, I&apos;d visit this beach as often as I can! In a word, just a paradise for pets and their owners. Some guys told me that if you go at the right time of year, you can even catch glimpses of whales breaching the waves.

I spent there almost the whole evening, amazing views.."
5,"Amazing places do not just have to live in your imagination, Get out and explore! 
San Francisco Bay area is a magical place of wonder!
 Fort Funston is one of those places, for humans and dogs and even people who think they can fly! 
Walk, Drive or Glide your way to this wonder of the Bay area, you will be glad you did!"
5,"Fort Funston, once a costal defense base during WWI, WWII and the cold war, definitely is a beautiful beach in San Francisco that seems to be populated mostly by locals (and a whole lot of dog walkers during the day). This dog friendly beach has a few hiking trails along the bluff and two routes down to the beach. One route, which is the most direct to the beach, has steps and a sand ladder that you can take to get to the beach. The other route will take you to the hang glider launching area. 

Fort Funston is known for rather windy conditions, in which you may just see some hang gliders take off at the edge of the bluff. Please be careful and be mindful of your dog, as there are signs regarding both humans and dogs to be forewarned of falling off the cliffs. 

There is a loop (paved) that you can walk with your pet on the bluff. Although this part of the loop is supposed to have leashed dogs, we (my husband, our little girl dog and I) saw many people letting their dogs walk unleashed. Figured I would make mention if your dog is not friendly with other dogs (we kept our little girl dog on the leash because we just wanted to make sure she stayed by us and also not to temp faith by getting too close to the cliffs). Also wanted to mention that parts of the loop did smell very strongly of urine (well you know dogs...). 

When we arrived, on a Thursday around 12 pm, we were surprised to see plenty of people (it wasn&apos;t crowded though). But we did see several dog walkers with a massive number of dogs though. 

Parking here is free. There are 2 lots. I would recommend parking in the lot that is closest to the paved loop so that you are closer to the dog beach part of this beautiful place. 

Please note that portapotties are available here (I didn&apos;t use them but wanted to make mention for those that really need to use it). 

Overall, had a nice time here with our little girl dog. If I lived in this area, I would definitely be a regular."
4,"Seeing our doggos running back and forth in the sand and attempting to go near the waves were enough to fill our day with bliss.

Fort Funston is thee place to be if you want to let your dogs socialize and run freely on the beach.

I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s the best beach that I&apos;ve been to as a human, but I&apos;m sure it was in the top three for our dogs.

The downside was how dirty I felt some of the pathways were to the beach, and I didn&apos;t think the beach itself was particularly clean, but it was definitely tolerable. Not like trash everywhere, but I have seen better. 

I did like how the paths leading to the beach were wide and long. 

Note: There is a pretty spacious parking lot."
5,"Leash free dog heaven - our favorite place to take the dogs. Beautiful place, miles to walk, friendly and cool fellow dog owners and totally awesome dogs. I try to get here at least twice and every time, no matter the weather, it&apos;s joyous!"
5,"Beautiful place to get away for some fresh air and exercise. Total trail length can be covered in 45 min to an hour. There are sand dunes and the trail leads down to a beach. There are cliffs which are quite a sight from the bottom. On a good day, there are gliders that take off from those cliffs and are cool to watch. It&apos;s a dog friendly trail. Plenty of dogs here. Parking lots are huge. Never had trouble parking there."
5,"High winds. Hang gliders. Doggos. Cliff walks. Hedge undergrowth. Cool ravens. Great views.

What. Is. Not. To. Love!

One time I had a dream where I was scrambling on my stomach underneath some kind of woody brush, like I was a rabbit. Walking through the hedgeways and paths here felt like what I saw in that dream had been made manifest. Did I always know I&apos;d be here? No. Memory is not reliable and dreams aren&apos;t real. But! It was magic and personal to me, so thanks for reading.

It&apos;s a fantastic spot to take a wander and enjoy the magic of nature. I love it here."
5,"This is a great place to relax or hike in Westlake. Recommend bringing a jacket as the winds and chill can pick up pretty quickly. Near the South Parking Lot, there&apos;s a hangglider launching point. It was pretty cool seeing them take off, glide in the air, and land. The park is also a VERY popular for dog owners. I&apos;d probably say that at least 20% of people there had dogs.
The trails themselves are quite flat and a mixture of paved roads and sandy trails. There&apos;s lot of cool things to look at including missile sites, ocean, SF, the rock garden, etc. There are people coming here for the beaches, but it was pretty chilly. You can easily spend a few hours exploring the area.
If you&apos;re looking for a strenuous hike, look elsewhere, but if you&apos;re looking for a place to walk and are a dog lover, this place is for you."
5,"Doggie heaven!! I&apos;m one of those sad people who can&apos;t have dogs in their rental so I go here to get a dose of dog energy. So many happy awesome dogs in nature living their best lives. 

Aside from the dogs, the beach is lovely for a walk and people are socially distant and respectful. It&apos;s a beautiful place for some exercise or to meditate and relax. I think people are also very mindful of picking up after themselves and their pets. 

There&apos;s also plenty of easy parking available. To access the beach, you&apos;ll need to take the stairs or go down beach dunes. And it&apos;s like a lot of stairs... Not sure if I saw access for differently abled folks, so keep that in mind if it&apos;s important to you."
5,"One of the most favorite places in San Francisco for me and many others. And here are some reasons why.

Located on a 200 ft high sandy mountainside this significant site opens great views f the coastline. Sunsets are something here, a must see for everyone been to SF. 
Come here to go downhill along the sandy trails and enjoy long walks along the seashore. The trails network will give you remarkable impressions from hiking, horse riding or walking and playing with dogs. Dog owners will be happy to know they can take leashes off here. Moreover it&apos;s also one of the premium hang-gliding spots across the US, which is considered to be one of the most exciting (and dangerous) air spots and is a must on a bucket list for any air sports lover!

Amazing spectacular wonderful place from one side can be extremely dangerous from the other, so be careful and keep a close eye on your dogs and kids, as they can get stuck on the bluffs.
And be prepared for some severe weather conditions!"
5,A wonderful day! Endless beach and trails for families to enjoy with their pups! It was worth getting up early and driving from the South Bay.
