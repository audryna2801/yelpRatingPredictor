5,"Came here during my visit to SF. There was patio seating only due to COVID, and I was promptly seated under a warm heat lamp. Host, server, and busboy services were all on point. There is free self parking in the back of the restaurant near the water. I didn&apos;t get to sit on the pier, but it was a nice ambiance anyway. I ordered the mixed seafood grill, which came with fish, shrimp, and rice. It was so delicious! Their house bread is fantastic as well!"
5,"Food and all the staff from beginning of meal to the end was exceptional.  Pim was our waiter and made good recommendations.  
Fish and crabmeat was soooo fresh.  Drinks were great. 
We even got to eat indoors which was a treat, coming from Southern California.  
We will come again next tome."
5,"San Francisco Restaurant Update:

Last Sunday we found ourselves up in The City looking for some pottery, and while we were there we decided to grab some chow and stopped by Fisherman&apos;s Wharf to grab some brunch.

The Wharf was eerily quiet for a late summer weekend, as the normal throng of tourists had dried-up due to The Rona™. While it was nice to have the place seemingly to ourselves, it also made us sad seeing a harsh reminder of our current predicament.

Regardless, we stopped by one of my all-time fav SF restaurants Scoma&apos;s which has been serving-up some of the freshest seafood in The Bay since 1965! 

Covid Update: 

-They are open for outdoor dining seven days a week: M-Fri 11:30 a.m. - 8:30 p.m. and Weekends 10 a.m. - 7:30 p.m. (Brunch 10 a.m. - 2 p.m.) 

-Outdoor dining was GLORIOUS!!! Fantastic views of the GGB, ocean, birds and even sea lions playing in the water!

-Always the best service at Scoma&apos;s, as their properly PPE&apos;d wait staff was always friendly, quick and knowledgeable.

-Online menus (accessed via QR code) and actual sanitized silverware

What&apos;s good:

-Gotta get the cioppino when you&apos;re here at Scoma&apos;s. It&apos;s a &quot;must-get&quot; item as their deliciously seasoned tomato broth is filled to the brim with tons of seafood from shrimp and clams to a generous portion of the already shelled crab--hence the term &quot;lazy man&apos;s&quot; cioppino. Pro Tip: Make sure to ask for extra sourdough to sop up the broth of your cioppino.

-Carissa ordered a Salmon Niçoise salad and she loved it. Their Wild King Salmon was cooked to perfection and the basil aioli had a great garlicky kick.

-It&apos;s not brunch without drinks and Scoma&apos;s certainly has that in spades, as we ordered a Mulemosa and Blackberry Cobbler--and they were both delicious!

Honestly this was probably our best all-around COVID dining experience from the fantastic food, service and views--we absolutely loved it. 

This is a great time for us locals to come out and rediscover old classics and help support food institutions to ensure they&apos;re around for years to come."
5,"Oh my gawd.  Y&apos;all have to order their $60 meal to go. It was amazing

First of all. It&apos;s a VERY generous portion.  Three of us shared it and there was leftovers (we did get a loaf of sourdough bread at Boudins to go with it). (It does come with a few pieces of bread and toast but we knew we wanted more bread to sop up the broth)

We had the cioppino with the ready to eat seafood. (Lazy man version) It was loaded with shrimp and scallops and crab and calamari and clams and fish hunks and mussels.  In a delicious tomato based broth 

We picked the clam chowder ( the other choice was Caesar  salad) and it&apos;s glorious

We got the chocolate cake (other choice is tiramisu) and it was delicious 

We biked here and easy to put  in back pack or other people were eating at tables outside by crab boats"
4,"Came here for Saturday lunch time (about 1pm) and had a great experience:

Food: B
Was really looking forward to a clam chowder bread bowl, but unfortunately the bread bowl wasn&apos;t a part of their menu. The clam chowder was still solid and the included bread made up for it. The rest of the food came out quickly. We got two pastas (as shown in the pictures) along with assorted fish, half crab legs, and gnocchi. The gnocchi was a bit softer than I expected but still good. 

Staff: A
Our waiter was really attentive and was pretty funny overall, making our experience that much more positive. The other staff also was quick in cleaning and made sure we had all our drinks quickly and efficiently. 

Parking: C
There is a parking garage you can pay for about 400m south, but otherwise you can do valet near the restaurant outside. 

Price: C+
The price is a bit higher than the normal brunch or lunch scene, but you are in SF so you can already expect a bit of a higher price per plate. But the quality was solid and I could see for some of the plates why they were priced the way they did. 

Overall: B
Had a solis experience here, but hoping they add breadbowl clam chowder!"
4,"Cioppino
Shrimp salad
Seafood pasta

All FIRE. All AMAZING. GOGO"
5,"first stop in san Francisco as Arizona tourists and we stopped at scomas for some drinks and appetizers and it was an incredible experience! we had Gus as our server and he was absolutely incredible. This place has the most amazing vibes, a definite must stop if you&apos;re ever in san Francisco!"
5,"This place is just classy old school SF dining at its best.  I fell in love with Scoma&apos;s on a vacation here years before I moved to San Francisco.  The ambiance, staff, view, food and overall experience are top notch!  They aren&apos;t cheap, but you get what you pay for.  I&apos;ve never had a dish here that was anything less than outstanding.  Crab cakes, Cioppino, pastas...get all of it.  I dont make it up to the Wharf too often, but I try to make Scoma time happen when I do.  This is a great date night or a place to take friends and family from out of town.  The whole menu is executed beautifully."
4,"This has nothing to do with my review, but here&apos;s a tip: Park in front of the restaurant, which you can find if you drive down the little side street. We parked in a garage where none of the tenants in the square validated! 

My fiance went here as a kid and it must have been impressionable because when we decided to go to fisherman&apos;s wharf, Scoma&apos;s was where he really wanted to go.

Luckily, there was a restaurant week-esque deal happening so we got a fairly &quot;good&quot; deal on oysters Rockefeller (though it was rich, it was really good -- surprisingly my favorite!), Caesar salad, and lazy make cioppino. We also ordered a side of calamari which ended up being lightly breaded/slightly mediocre and a little too much food for us.

The Caesar salad was actually really delicious -- lemony and creamy. The cioppino was a little watery to me; slightly on the band side.

However, the SERVICE is what stood out to me. I had no problem leaving a generous tip because the waitress here are clearly lifers. They go above and beyond to take care of you. As it&apos;s still COVID times, we elected to dinevoutdoors. We got a &quot;city view&quot; which was slightly too sunny for my liking. After one of the other diners left, they were able to get us an outdoor lawn umbrella to provide us some relief from the sun.

Bathrooms are super clean and though the food was typical tourist/seafood pricey, I wouldn&apos;t mind coming back here if push came to shove!"
4,"It had been over six months since I had had a meal at a restaurant or made a reservation. With the sun shining, the idea of enjoying a cold crab salad overlooking the water appealed to me. Plus it&apos;s a nice image thinking of Al Scoma creating a family business 50+ years ago and having a pier named after him. Could such a story unfold for a scrappy go-getter these days?

We were a few minutes early for our lunch reservation, so we took the time to enjoy the view of the water and the mosaic ode to the city outside. Definitely easy to appreciate on a warm day. A few minutes later, we were seated at a picnic style table and received sourdough bread and whipped butter, and glasses of ice water. 

Unfortunately, one of the glasses had remnants of red lipstick on it. We brought it to our server&apos;s attention, and later on, he replaced our water. Without a word, he took the glass and walked away. I couldn&apos;t help thinking it would have been nice if he had shown some sign of remorse. I understand that dishwashers can leave behind residue, but given these especially germaphobic times, a little sign of concern for the patrons from the staff goes a long way. 

$13 Crab Bisque Bowl:
This orange bowl had a creamy tomato flavor with chunks of crab meat, topped with chives and cracked pepper. 

$21 Scoma&apos;s Dungeness Crab Cake:
A pair of lightly battered and fried crab medallions were served with a small portion of arugula salad on the side and some creamy dipping salad. The crab was still chunky, which was definitely a plus, because that definitely beats crab cakes with pulverized crab mush.

$47 Scoma&apos;s Crab Louis Salad &quot;Classic&quot; 1/2 lb:
I knew the Crab Louis was going to be a large portion, even with the smaller &quot;Classic&quot; sized portion, but when I saw the plate set down in front of me, I knew we would have leftovers. The pile of crab meat sat on top of shredded lettuce, decked out with juicy heirloom tomatoes, cucumber slices, a boiled egg, bell peppers, carrots, olives, lemon wedges, and a ramekin overflowing with Louis dressing. It was cool and refreshing, not to mention the crab and the accoutrements were sweet and satisfying. My only complaint was I would have preferred if the carrot were peeled, because the outer layers looked a touch hairy. 
I happily packed up the leftovers and looked forward to digging into it for my next meal. Our server joked that we did a good effort, but ate too much of the salad, haha.

I thoroughly enjoyed the food, and I probably would have enjoyed it even more if I had the opportunity to witness seeing the &apos;Pier to Plate&apos; process unfold. I would rate my experience a 7/10, and would be more of a solid 4/5 had it not been for the dirty glasses. I wish I could say that I will save myself the money and make my own Crab Louis, but I sure do appreciate someone else shelling all that crab."
5,Heather was wonderful! Everyone was very kind and attentive. All of the employees were very aware of keeping their distances and we truly enjoyed our evening!
5,"Love this place!! Before I start, this place is definitely on the more pricey side but it&apos;s worth the cost. I ordered the clam chowder and an old fashioned Manhattan. This place has the best tasting clam chowder that I have ever had before. The fish is fresh and the broth is great, very flavorful. My Manhattan was strong, they do not skimp out on the alcohol here. Customer service was great, our waiter was very attentive. This place has a 1920s ambiance, you can pick the room you want to eat in. We sat in the Hollywood room, we had a great view of the bay. Overall great food and great experience."
4,"Enjoyed a nice late lunch / early dinner here last weekend. It was our first time here, but we have heard great things about this place prior to visiting. 

We made reservations online and waiting about 15 minutes to be seated. I definitely recommend making reservations rather than walking in. The parking can be a pain, but what else is new in SF. There are tables set up in the front and back of the restaurant. The tables in the front had heaters, while the tables in the back did not. Towards the end of the meal, it got really chilly so I think all the tables should have the heaters nearby. 

To share we got the calamari, mussels and claim chowder. Everything, along with the complimentary bread was fresh and delicious. The calamari was lightly breaded which was nice. The clam chowder was hot, creamy and super fresh. For my main dish I got the cioppino and my bf got the mixed grill. Both were delicious and the broth of the cioppino was yums! Only complaint was that my soda was flat. 

Service overall was good. I would definitely recommend to other and will be back again."
5,"What a cute spot! Glad we made a reservation and got to pay them a visit. It&apos;s down a quiet pier which was nice and surprisingly quiet despite being so close to the bustling Fisherman&apos;s Wharf just down the road. The staff was lovely and the soups were great! Chowder was tastier than the bisque, in our opinion. The bisque was good but very rich and we could&apos;ve done with just a cup of it instead of the bowl."
5,"This is San Francisco&apos;s finest fresh seafood fine dining restaurant!

Best Best roasted garlic crab different from Crustaceans  got its own unique groove. Really good!

I also got the Diplomatica forgot to get pictures it&apos;s an off the menu pasta in white sauce with some crab meat and scallops! Helllla Good!"
3,"We were deciding where to go for brunch on a Sunday morning, so my friend found this place on yelp and we decided to head there!

The actual place is pretty large, but we decided to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather. We ordered a bowl of the clam chowder (really good!) and I ordered the Eggs Benedict. The egg sat on top of a crab cake type concoction which was a bit too salty for my taste. Then a couple times we had asked our waiter for a water (we never got water, but only our morning cocktails), but he kept forgetting. Finally the person that was bring out the food and bread went to go grab it after we had asked him once! 

Then came the awkward part... We were paying for our tab, and the waiter asked us if a 20% tip was OK. Everything was on a little computer device, so we just sort of rolled with it. I mean I understand because of Covid, they probably would not want us to touch the device, but to automatically assume 20% is a bit much. 

If you want to eat somewhere by the water, this place is decent. With all the other options that&apos;s available in SF, I&apos;m not sure I would visit this place again."
5,"Some beautiful outside seating here. What a view! Enjoyed a bottle of Albirino from Spain. Crisp white light wine. Perfect for a warm day. We shared calamari, crab cakes, beet salad and clams on garlic toast    Every item was delicious. And our server this sweet native of France was so delightful."
5,Scoma&apos;s has been a family favorite of ours for YEARS. Tim is amazing. The food is fantastic. The atmosphere is welcoming. You will have a great time here. I can&apos;t wait to go back
5,Came back again and we were not disappointed. Nice outdoor seating. Everything was delish and outshined the $200 meal we had last night and was less costly. Make a reservation and go enjoy yourself.
5,"I&apos;m so glad we came here for dinner. Made last minute reservations for a party of 4. I really wanted the open out side seating area but it was full so we decided to sit inside. I was really happy of how they gave ample space for each party. 

The servers were great! Very attentive and explained each dish that was served. Not too many places do that now a days. I would definitely come again for lunch/dinner . Everything was delicious!"
