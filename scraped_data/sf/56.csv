5,"First time back since the March shutdown. We took down pretty much everything on the menu including the pulpo, ceviche mixto, califlor, bone marrow, chorizo (2), and the skirt steak... killed some palomas and other great cocktails as well.

Pamela. Pamela. Pamela. Thank you so much!!! The best server and took great care of us. What a nice person. 

We&apos;ll be back as soon as you guys reopen to do it again. Thank you!!"
5,"This is a long overdue review! We decided to try this place because of its good reviews on Yelp and  because of recommendations from friends. We made reservations to dine in (pre-covid-19). The restaurant was dark, but lively. The staff were friendly and attentive. The water glasses were dirty, so I didn&apos;t drink from them. The food, however, was awesome! 

We ordered a few items to try. We ordered: bife de chorizo, pollo a la vara, empanadas de carne, and provoleta. Everything we ordered was delicious!! They were cooked to perfection and tasted so flavorful! My favorites were the steak and chicken. The meat was so tender, juicy, and delicious! I definitely recommend this place for a fun dinner out! I also can&apos;t wait to to go back and try other items on their menu."
5,"**During Covid/SIP** Offering pickup/delivery now

Note - not stated on their Lolinda website, but pickup is at a different location (Barvale on divis). 

Still love the food and excited they&apos;re back, but don&apos;t make the mistake of picking up at the Lolinda restaurant like we did and having your food get cold!"
4,"If you love meat, you&apos;ve got to try it the Argentinian way. Lolinda brings Argentinian flavors with meats cooked over their wood-fired asador grill, and also serves other Latin American specialties. I came here for two separate celebrations - once for my birthday before COVID-19, and then recently for a COVID-19 Father&apos;s Day take home feast. If you are out celebrating something, I&apos;d definitely consider putting Lolinda on your list to visit once dining in opens again!

One thing to consider is that when dining in, it&apos;s pretty dark inside. Lolinda is one of the least camera-friendly places I&apos;ve been to - good for a romantic atmosphere, but very bad for food pictures.

For my birthday, we had a variety of small dishes to share. We were started off with the empanadas de carne, which contains a mixture of ground beef, raisins, egg, potato, and olives with a side of chimichurri. The filling is mostly beef! There was a fruity sweetness from the raisins, and tasted so good drenched in the oily herbs of the chimichurri. It was pleasantly crispy, and while I&apos;ve had cheaper and better empanadas, these were still good.

We also had the pulpo, which was a bunch of tasty and tender octopus and potato pieces under a bunch of fresh frisee. It&apos;s really good, but wish I had more pieces!

The vigoron, which comes with a few big slabs of pork belly and fried yuca, topped with a vinegary cabbage slaw. The pork belly was quite soft and crispy, though mostly from the super char! I naturally dislike pork belly so could have done without, otherwise it&apos;s pretty tasty pork.

The hueso asado was my personal favorite pequeno dish - there&apos;s so much marrow on the bone! It&apos;s so flavorful by itself even without the chile de arbol jelly. Yummy with the crispy crostini, and I guess the jicama is there to clean the palate after all the meaty fat!

The ceviche mixto is a zesty good ol&apos; ceviche with fried corn crunchies, but kind of small. It&apos;s good, but the cooked meats outshine this.

We ordered the asado mixto to try a variety of meats. It included chorizo, morcilla, flap loin, short rib, potatoes, and peppers. The platter was pretty cool, but potatoes and shishito peppers took up a lot of space. The interesting items were the sweet chorizo sausage and the soft blood sausage, though I wouldn&apos;t order them alone. The other meats were a little overdone, but saved by the charred taste. A slice of hard bread is included as well as chimichurri.

We also tried the ojo de bife, the ribeye steak (18oz). This was really good, and although it looks a bit too charred, it&apos;s heavenly meat! The buttery herb sauce they put on it did wonders, and chimichurri was also there to make every bite amazing.

To celebrate my birthday, Lolinda provided a complimentary coffee cake with a dollop of sour cream on top and a candle! It&apos;s a lovely rich end to a meaty meal.

Besides my past birthday celebration, Lolinda offered a Father&apos;s Day prime rib feast for four as takeout during COVID-19. Included was chimichurri-crusted prime rib, mashed potatoes, esquite with chili and cotija cheese, hearts of palm salad, and tres leches cake. The prime rib was delicious, though not much different than what you can make yourself from Costco. The rub was pretty salty, and did not have much chimichurri essence, unfortunately! I wish they just gave a tub of chimichurri for us to drown it in. They provided a whipped horseradish concoction that was airy and light, and did have hints of chimichurri herbs. The mash was extremely buttery and smooth. The esquite was lightly spiced and mixed with creamy cotija cheese and bits of sweetened tomato. The hearts of palm salad was quite fresh and zesty with a lime vinaigrette. Finally, the tres leches cake was a sponge-like cake soaked in heavy cream, topped with a sweet sour cream frosting. This was a good package for $160 and I&apos;d love to partake in future takeout meal sets like this! Be sure to confirm what location you are picking up from, though, as they use kitchens in more than one location in San Francisco.

It&apos;s rare to find Argentine focused cooking here. If you&apos;re looking for a unique steakhouse, Lolinda is one of the best contenders that will give you great steaks with a different flavor and experience."
4,"If you&apos;re searching for delicious, authentic (and slightly high end) Argentinian food, then search no further. The meat is so true to Argentina (and I lived there for 6 months), and the wine is divine! I recommend getting the octopus to start and the bone marrow dish too. delicious! however, i am giving 4 stars because i think the menu is over priced for the portion size. youll definitely pay more than you think is fair. but what can i say, the food is bomb!"
5,"So this is probably one of the first 5 star ratings I&apos;ve given here on yelp and I&apos;ll break it on down as to why! 
1. Service was great
2. Food was simply amazing
3. Drinks outstanding 
4. Ambiance insanely gorgeous

I&apos;m in love with Lolinda! The food, atmosphere and everything pairs well with the tone and vibe of the place. I went with a group of coworkers and we had a blast. For appetizers we ordered the best potato croquettes (soft fried potatoes A MUST TRY) pork belly and proveleta ( cheesy chimichurri dish topped with bacon marmalade and a side of bread). For our main entrees we ordered a few Ribeyes and NY strips yet they offer a variety of steaks such as NY strip, Ribeye, Skirt, Flat iron, Short rib, and Porkchops. The Ribeye was awesome!!!!  Perfectly cooked, seasoned and grilled then topped with a butter sauce. The potatoes where drizzled and tossed in a chimichurri sauce. The pork belly was lightly fried over a bed of coleslaw.  Every appetizer was amazing and main course meals awesome! It isn&apos;t too pricey either depends on what you&apos;re going for. Overall everything was delicious!!!"
5,"My husband and I were in San Fran visiting some good friends. One of the places they suggested was Lolinda. They made reservations for 4 people at 5:30 pm right when they opened.

When we showed up, we were a couple of minutes early and waited outside. There was a couple of people who came to wait as well. At 5:30 PM, they let us in and showed us to our table immediately. When we got inside, it was gorgeous, with lots of dark wood, and like you just transported into a completely different world. I loved it. 

We had another dinner reservations for much later, so we decided to just a get a couple of plates to share. The menu is mainly made out for sharing a bunch of plates. We decided on the croquetas, the chorizo, the octopus, the pork belly, and the bone marrow. We didn&apos;t wait too long for the first couple of dishes to show up. The corquetas were delicious, steaming hot and perfectly cooked. The aioli it came with was a good addition to it. The bone marrow was AMAZING. It was fatty and just delicious. The pork belly also had the perfect amount of fat and was cooked very well. The chorizo was well spiced and not dry. I really enjoyed everything here. The service was great, our waiter was attentive, but not overbearing. 

The ambiance was nice. A little loud, but normal for such a popular restaurant. It was dark with romantic/moody lightning. I really enjoyed our time there. The place was packed by the time we left, and I highly recommend reservations."
5,"Staycation in SF for our anniversary and this place was highly recommended by many. They stay open till midnight which was awesome! We had an 11pm reservation and when we walked in, immediate greeted by a friendly face and beautiful decor. 

The host wished us a happy anniversary and guided us over to the main dining area, still packed despite it being the last hour.

The concept of Lolinda is like a family style espetus. The focus is high quality, bold flavored meat!!  We ordered a hot appetizer, a plate/ entree, and a meat only dish. WAY more than we anticipated for 2 people. 

Bone Marrow (pequeno- hot). As a lover of bone marrow, Lolita did this right. The marrow was salted to perfection, roasted with the juices oozing out, but lightly charred on top to give it a crunchy texture, which balanced out the fatty marrow. It honestly felt like a heartattack with each bite, but in a good way? 

Tira (Platos) - braised chili short rib over veggies. SUPER RICH. It was like a twist to the mole. Fall off the bone, melt in your mouth short ribs, smothered in this thick creamy (spicy) chili sauce. I love this dish, but I caution if you order this dish it will fill you up and quite possibly need to be rolled to your car/Uber. 

Everything from food to service was beyond. I now recommend this place to any one asking for recs in SF and I hope to come back here again soon!"
5,"As we continued our birthday weekend, and after drinks at El Techo, we came here for dinner since it was recommended.  Since we didn&apos;t have a reservation, the friendly hostess said we could sit anywhere in the bar.  We also said Hi to the guy who wanted to take our photo at El Techo, so we knew this was where we were suppose to be.  Bartender took great care of us!

We started with a bottle of Rose of Malbec....very very good! We also ordered a carne empanada and a pollo empanada to share.  Oh so good!  We also shared the Entrana...grilled skirt steak, another delicious dish!  We also ordered two desserts, the flourless chocolate cake and the cheesecake, both ended our evening on a high note.

Now here is where it becomes magical.  Talking with the bartender, we find out that a Mano, El Techo, and Lolinda are all owned by Back of the House restaurant group.  We had no idea so over the course of a day, we hit up three of their best!  I love when things happen like that!  I also passed on a little of the magic and paid for a couple&apos;s dinner, that&apos;s how wonderful the day had been."
4,"After hearing great things about this place, the girlfriend and I got a chance to dine at Lolinda for the first time tonight after spending the day in wine country.  Came right at opening and was able to snag a open seating table no problem. Great first impression of the restaurant; very large, spacious spot, loved the dim lighting, really gives off the upscale steakhouse vibes.
For food, we ordered tira asada, entrana, camaron, &amp; papas. 

Camaron- the grilled shrimp were good, &amp; the salsa criolla w/red onion really made this dish! Wish there were more/larger shrimp
Tira Asada (short rib)/ Entrana (skirt steak)- meat was grilled perfectly, very juicy and tender; skirt steak came out perfect medium rare! Chimichurri side was good but nothing memorable (too much oil vs chopped ingredients in it). Despite how good it was, was bummed at the size of the skirt steak, for $18 the cut was extremely small
Papas- for simple roasted yukon potatoes, these were prepared very well and was a great compliment as a side to the meats

Overall, great, well-prepared food, but the common theme for me for this place was that portion sizes did not match up to what you pay for (small portions, expensive $$$ food). I probably won&apos;t be back for a while due in large to that fact. Oh well, at least the food was delicious"
5,"***4.5 stars***


Celebrated my birthday dinner at the lovely Lolinda, an Argentinian steakhouse located in the Mission. Lolinda is known for their grilled fired meats, tapas and handcrafted cocktails. The space was very dimly lit and not great for taking photos but overall I loved the ambience. It&apos;s dark, a little sexy, extra loud and Latin gaucho chic, is that a thing? 

My husband made an early reservation but we chose to sit at the bar instead since it was Happy Hour and I prefer the more casual vibe of a bar setting anyway. Happy Hour cocktails are ($7), 7 days a week, until 7:00 p.m. Clever ;) 

We ordered 2 empanadas, the chicken and the beef off the HH menu ($3 ea.) They both had a nice crispy crust and savory fillings and came with 2 dipping sauces- aji amarillo for the chicken and some kind of au jus for the beef. These might&apos;ve been the best empanadas I&apos;ve ever had! Try these! 

I ordered the gin highball ($7) elderflower, grapefruit bitters, tonic and soda. It was simple and delicious. My husband ordered a Stem cider ($8)

Everything comes a la carte and we shared all of our dishes. We ordered the Chuleta, an on the bone 15 oz. pork chop. ($27) This dish was recommended to us by the nice bloke over at Myriad. It was incredible and the highlight of our meal. The pork chop was perfectly marinated and so tender I couldn&apos;t believe it was pork, since it&apos;s a meat that&apos;s so easy to overcook. I&apos;ve never had anything like the Chuleta, try this! 

We also ordered the Ojo de Bife, an 18 oz. ribeye steak ($45) medium rare. This was also outstanding, however the steak came out rare rather than medium rare. We ended up taking it home as it would&apos;ve been too much of a hassle to have them cook it more and it come out wrong a second time which was a previous experience we had at another restaurant a few weeks ago. So to avoid that, we had a few bites on the outer edges of the steak which was delicious and very nicely seasoned and set the rest aside as it was too rare for us both. Anyhow, I&apos;m a self proclaimed &quot;master reheater&quot;- the ribeye held up nicely and was a perfect medium rare the next day. 

We had an order of the yuca fries ($8) these were interesting, about the size of steak fries- nice and crispy on the outside with a creamy texture on the inside. We also ordered the Hongos, mushrooms sautéed in red wine and herb butter.($8) Both sides were fantastic, I would order them both again, but would definitely want to try new side dishes as well.

We ended with dessert and were torn between the Churros with a dulce de leche and chocolate dipping sauce and the lemon bar (I think it was) and we ended up getting the Churros. They were okay, probably my least favorite thing we ordered as they were a little dense for churros, but they were still good. 

Our bartenders/servers were extremely charming and engaging in conversation. Service was fast and went smoothly. Even with bar seating, the setting still felt intimate, must be that lighting. I had such a great overall experience at Lolinda, I&apos;m really looking forward to going back!"
4,"Lolinda is one of those fancy restaurants in the Mission that is always busy on a Friday and Saturday night, probably because the food is quite nice and the atmosphere is what a lot of people (re: rich techie types)) are looking for in their weekend dining out experiences.

The service is very good and I loved the flavors in the food. We got the pork belly appetizer and asado mixto to share. Plus one drink each and our bill was $120 after tip. I felt pretty satisfied so I would say the value was good, but it was definitely pricier than I would usually want to pay for what I think was a pretty standard meat plate. Everything was lovely but for almost $50 I think they were a little heavy on the peppers and potatoes when we may have wanted a teeny bit more meat. 

Overall, I think Lolinda is a great little spot but somewhat overhyped in my opinion. I think the flavors of the dishes at Alma Cocina were more interesting and memorable where here they felt very much how I would expect it to be. Nothing more, but certainly nothing less either.

I am lactose intolerant but I still have a sweet tooth so I always like to take a quick glance at the dessert menus to see if there&apos;s anything I can eat. Possibly the coconut flan, but I don&apos;t really care for flan. Would have loved to try the churros but I definitely don&apos;t think I could have eaten that. As it was, I was pushIng it with the sautéed mushrooms which were definitely cooked in butter."
5,"Place with balls and bulls! Last bastion of authentic Gaucho cooking in SF. One of few places in SF to use real wood instead of ironing their steaks. Been here over 100 (ONE HUNDRED) times. Date nights, client meetings, international guests....spectacular every time. We even named the bulls. 

DO NOT deviate from the following meal plan:

Cocktails: 4 Lessons or Emotional Rescue or a good old Old Fashioned. 

Appetizer: corn fritters, shishito peppers, grilled artichoke.

Mid-meal: pulpo + cauliflower 

Main: flat iron steak + vegetal screwer.

Desert: cookies with milk (and bourbon). 

Let Dustin and Pamela take 5* care of you and ...If you hate it, walk upstairs and console yourself with guacamole and chips."
5,"One of my alltime favorite restaurants!

Lolinda is a great steakhouse located in the Mission. Lolinda is always busy so I highly recomend making a reservation in advance. *Do note that if your whole party is not present they will not seat you.

The staff is very nice and frinedly. The last time I was there our waiter was great- he offered a lot of recomendations to our group and had a lovely conversation with us.

I highly recomend trying the ceviche, skewers and the churros. Honeslty, anything and everything on the menu is good here."
5,"We just had one of their Family Meals To-Go &amp; it was OUTSTANDING. Short ribs braised in malbec; creamy polenta; roasted veggies; quinoa salad &amp; a &quot;chocotorta&quot; that was truly to die for (think it had creme fraiche, which cut the sweetness but made it even more decadent - wish this was on the regular menu). Added an order of their yummy empanadas. Large portion sizes &amp; very good value, especially for the quality."
5,This place was AMAZING with wonderful views. Mathew was our server but everyone was very nice and friendly. We ordered the tacos and a meal that had beef and some sort of spinach tortilla as can&apos;t remember the name of the dish. The views of San Francisco were incredible.
5,This place is the ultimate date spot. Can get crowded pretty quickly so best to reserve a table ahead of time. The architecture and decor is that Spanish baller vibes you see in Narcos Mexico. The ambience along with the great service is what really makes this a great place to bring the ol lady or the big fella. Be prepared to break bread because it is expensive but worth it. Asado Mixto and the empanadas are the way to go. The asado mixto is a meat sampler for two which allows you to try the delectable steaks and sausages without committing to one. The empanadas were absolutely delicious. Like so good I would go back just to eat them. Especially the veggie ones. Overall this place is great for any celebrations or simply to have a wonderful mean. 10/10 would recommend
4,"I&apos;ve bookmarked Lolinda for about 3 years now. A former colleague recommended it to me. When my birthday rolled around, I&apos;ve decided to settle for something that  
wasn&apos;t omakase for once. Reservations were made and our party of four strolled in on a weekend. Unfortunately for us, the week we went was the same week as Dreamforce and all the techbros decided  to have HH as well. Thus, the atmosphere was quite loud. My hope for an intimate evening evaporated as soon as we were seated. 

Food- extremely small portions. Very flavorful, although I wouldn&apos;t recommend coming here for dinner. This is more a tapas styled place. If you had the drunkchies or want to  have a light meal and fuel up on booze--this is the place for you. 

Service- we brought our own cake and the restaurant was aware of this. I think they even charged a cake fee, or something to that effect. Lo and behold, I think the check came and my cake was not brought out. Um hello? Any SF native would know a cake from Schubert&apos;s would not be forgotten (insert eye roll). 

Anyway, bottom line is that this place is good for HH. Afaik, you&apos;d prob fare better elsewhere for a dinner."
4,"The space here is cute and is larger than expected as there is upstairs seating. It is a big loud in here so expect to yell quite a bit. 

Food:
Cauliflower - very good 
Broccolini - very good
Octopus - decent"
4,"Lolinda is a great dinner spot in San Francisco&apos;s Mission District!

I made plans to have dinner here with no reservation. We were told tables wouldn&apos;t be open for hours, but that the high tables would be first-come-first-serve. We were lucky there was one personal table open immediately! I didn&apos;t think the high tables were so bad, still had a great dining experience.

Here&apos;s what I think about what we got: 

Pistelero - Mezcal- and Gin-based cocktail, kind of like non-traditional negroni. Definitely spiritous, but still a well-balanced drink. 

Easy Rider - Sweet with a bit of heat, much easier to sip on. 

Ceviche Mixto - Juicy and delicious, really enjoyed the little corn fritters that accented the dish as well. 

Hueso Asado - Bone marrow? Say no more. DELICIOUS!! I would order this again. 

Ojo de Bife - Ribeye steak. Super juicy, loved the chimichurri sauce this was served with.

Overall, great experience. While we lucked out on getting seats, I&apos;d recommend making a reservation ahead of time to avoid a potential nightmare."
