5,"I got the fisherman&apos;s Benedict. I&apos;ve heard so much about surisan. I made reservations and recommend that you reserve more than 24 hours in advance if you want to dine on the weekends. There was even a long line of people who wanted to dine-in without reservations. They have a lot of outdoor seating. Brunch is quite busy.

The fisherman&apos;s Benedict was delicious! There was a plentiful amount of crab. The potatoes were perfection and crispy. 

I need to come back to try out other dishes, especially the dishes on their dinner menu. Their brunch menu is pretty standard with some Korean fusion."
5,"Amazinggg breakfast spot with great outdoor seating vibes! Get the:
1- blueberry stuffed French toast - it&apos;s crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with the perfect amount of crunch.
2 - The millionaire&apos;s bacon was also worth a try, although I think two pieces is more than enough to split between two people. It tastes candied, with a good blend of sweet and salty.
3 - bibimbap (dol sat) - I don&apos;t usually order this at restaurants but since our server recommended it, we ended up giving it a try and we were absolutely floored by how delicious the meat was mixed in with rice mushrooms, etc...
4 - matcha mojito was too sweet for my liking but worth a try"
5,"Our daughter chose this place because she was craving Korean food. She and her bf have been here before so they ordered all the food.

I ordered tofu soup because, yummmm! Everything was delicious. The staff was very attentive. The restaurant was following covid protocol and we will definitely be back when we visit next year!"
5,"Came here on a Sunday Brunch around 11:30am! We put our name on the Yelp Waitlist which was nice! It was about a 40 minute wait and 18th in line. It was pretty busy. Parking was not too bad, there are meters close by. 

Service was quick and received our waters. I ordered the Lychee-JU Soju on their Morning Cocktail Menu and my friend ordered the Mimosa. Great cocktails to start the morning! 

Two of us ordered the Bulgogi Beef Fried Rice, in addition, Bibimbap Tofu Bowl, the Dolsot Bibimbap Spicy Pork and another of the same dish with Bulgogi Beef! Everything was delicious! If you like Korean dishes for brunch this is the place to try! 

Thank you Surisan for the great service we will be back soon!"
3,"We made a reservation for Sunday brunch a week in advanced as it gets booked up pretty quickly here! There&apos;s a cute outdoor seating area with bistro lights that&apos;s in the shade. We opted to sit in the area closer to the sidewalk in the sun. Service was attentive and quick. On to the food...

Fried chicken appetizer 3/5: We were excited to try this based on reviews but these definitely were not the best batch of Korean fried chicken we&apos;ve had. The outer coat was pretty dense and crunchy, but not crispy. The soy garlic sauce was just okay. At least the chicken wasn&apos;t dry. 

Blueberry stuffed crunch French toast 4/5: this dish was delicious! I love the texture of the crunchy outer part of the French toast and the sauce it&apos;s served with just completes the dish. We also added millionaire&apos;s bacon and eggs for an extra $9. The millionaire&apos;s bacon was a hit! Tender, sweet, and thick. 

Soufflegg 2/5: this dish was pretty bland and not worth the $22 at all. It literally just taste&apos;s like eggs that I make at home, topped with a couple pieces of shrimp, potatoes, and veggies. Don&apos;t get me wrong, the eggs were cooked well, are soft and fluffy, but that&apos;s it. There&apos;s absolutely no depth to this dish. The potatoes had a charred taste and the bread got super soggy since this dish is pretty watery and the bread is served in the dish rather than on the side. Would not recommend this dish at all. 

Overall I wasn&apos;t very impressed and was let down because I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for the longest time. Plus it was a hefty bill of $83 for brunch."
5,"Came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and fortunately we were able to get seated before lunch ended (s/o to the nice host for keeping me on the waitlist even when we had the slightest chance of being seated and were going to come by dinner time instead). 

- Blueberry stuffed crunch French toast: YES. SO. GOOD. Def reminded me of the crunchy French toast in SoCal at blue jam cafe. 

- Millionaire&apos;s bacon flight: yummy sweet and salty bacon! Our fav was the rosemary and orange flavors. 

- KFC (sweet and spicy): had a nice crispy texture and flavor was good. 

- Country KFC benedict: the potato&apos;s were tasty and the Benedict was good. The sauce/gravy could have more flavor to it though. 

- Matcha mojito: it tasted more sour/tart which I wasn&apos;t expecting, but it was still good. 

Service was awesome and fast! Def check this place out if you&apos;re in the mood for a Korean American fusion. Will be back!"
5,"Join the Yelp waitlist at Surisan cause trust me when I say it&apos;ll be worth the wait! Korean brunch, where have you been my whole life?!

Next time I come here I hope to come with a large group considering the vast menu options and how good it all looks. When I went here I got the ramyun cup on the brunch menu (comes with the so very famous billionaire bacon) and the ricotta crunchy French toast. Both were so fantastic, however I could definitely use some hot sauce for my noodles and some syrup (comes with caramel instead) for my French toast but all in all great food and great service."
3,"3.5/5 stars

I recommend utilizing the Yelp waitlist if you aren&apos;t able to get a reservation here!

There is a lot of hype around this place so expectations are understandably higher. However, I do think this is one of those instagrammable places where they upcharge simple okay dishes because they know people come for the pics. I, myself, love going to an aesthetic place for pics too. But this review is based on the food.

The tteobokki came in weird long skinny pieces. It was more udon like. The texture was okay but not as chewy. It was also pretty plain served on its own in a sauce that wasn&apos;t very spicy. 

I was most disappointed in the bulgogi fried rice. It&apos;s not a bad fried rice at all. Its just not a $20 korean fried rice. Their dishes are fairly one toned. It was savory with the bulgogi but thats about it. It was missing some layers. I took the leftovers home, added some sesame oil, onions and kimchi and it was soo much better.

Ultimately I would say its okay food that&apos;s worth it for the check-in and pics but not if you&apos;re looking for good korean food worth the price."
5,"Never a disappointment at Surisan! Food is excellent! I had brunch at 12:45pm and made an appointment two days prior through Yelp! Was seated right away when I got there!

I ordered the spicy pork bap, blueberry stuffed crunch French toast and flight of millionaire&apos;s bacon. 

Spicy Pork Bap ($18): The spicy pork in this dish was excellent! Would&apos;ve been nice if they added more pork since everything else was plain. It came with a side of hot sauce and I thought it was gochujang but unfortunately it was not... it was just a side of sriracha. Note to restaurant: please use gochujang instead of sriracha!

Blueberry stuffed crunch French toast ($16): this was my absolute favorite dish out of the three! I love how fluffy the French toast was and the outside was light and crunchy to perfection! The best part was the blueberry and cream stuffing! Creamy and refreshing! It came with a caramel sauce but I also asked for a side a syrup as well and it was the perfect sweetness with both sauces combined.

Flight of Millionaire&apos;s Bacon ($20): it came with 4 flavors of the millionaire&apos;s bacon: Citron, original, cinnamon and rosemary. All are good, but my favorites are the original and cinnamon! 

Parking: metered parking only but highly recommend taking Lyft or Uber if you can. Parking can be tough or expensive at the parking garages."
4,"The service was good, fast, attentive.

The food
KFC: doesn&apos;t feel fresh, seem like re-fry and not crispy.
Pancakes: soft, fluffy, tasty
Pimped up ramyun : taste good but the noodle too soft, seem overcooked"
4,"The food was absolutely amazing. Every time I&apos;m in SF I want to come back to this place. We booked reservations for brunch on a Saturday a few days in advance and it was already getting full so book ahead. The drinks were so aesthetic and delicious. Highly recommend the banana latte and the strawberry matcha. As for the food, we all went for the Korean brunch options and were not disappointed. Everything came on a steaming hot plate filled with veggies. The spicy pork was my fav--definitely order it! 

Also, they&apos;re limiting the time to 75 minutes and are really strict about it."
3,"I&apos;ve ordered three times during SIP and have had mixed experiences with the flavor and quality. I like the concept - twist on Korean classics for brunch - but I find that execution is inconsistent. Perhaps the experience is better in person, because the food stays warmer and is more flavorful?  

My favorite dish is the Boosted Jook, which is the perfect comfort food for a dreary weekend morning. I&apos;ve had mediocre experience with other dishes though 

Spicy Pork BAP - Flavor was way too sweet
Fries - A little soggy and flavor was not as rich as I would have liked  
Belly Bap (pork belly with rice) - I found the pork belly to be pretty dry"
4,"Such a cute spot right down the street from Pier 39! They make outdoor dining magical with all of their decorative lights and plants! 

I spontaneously stumbled upon Surisan with a group of 5 people including myself. We ended up lucking out because we were able to get a table without any reservations right before the dinner rush! 

Note: Yelp does offer the option to make a reservation with Surisan. I highly recommend doing this! 

Bulgogi Bap: 4/5 
I ordered the Bulgogi Bap which was really delicious! The Bulgogi was very flavorful and the kimchi was the right amount of spicy for me. It was $17 for the dish which is about average for SF prices. I do wish it came with a little bit more meat and kimchi because I was still a slightly hungry later. 

Pimped up Ramyun: 5/5
My friends ordered the Ramyun which came with the Millionaires Bacon. If you haven&apos;t tried the Millionaires Bacon I highly recommend it! If you are a bacon fan, you absolutely have to try it! It&apos;s such a thick and juicy cut with a mouth watering seasoning. It also has the perfect crunch which pairs very well with ramen. This dish was $18. Similar to the Bulgogi Bap I do wish it came with a little more in the serving. 

Loco Moco: 3/5
I&apos;m used to the Hawaiian style Loco Moco so this was a very different taste than what I&apos;m used to. It&apos;s not that it wasn&apos;t good, it was just very different from what I was expecting. I wouldn&apos;t recommend ordering it if you&apos;re expecting a Hawaiian style Loco Moco."
4,"Dine in during Covid-19
Overall: 7.5/10
A pretty enjoyable meal which brighten my day up! 

Bulgogi Fried Rice: 8/10
The first bite wasn&apos;t that good when it was hot. However, it tasted soo good when it got a little less hot later. How weird but so enjoyable. It&apos;s like they use beef broth to cook the rice instead of water so you have that beef flavor in every bite of the rice (not sure if this is how they actually cook it).

Korean Fried Chicken- Soy and Garlic: 7.5/10

Korean Fried Chicken- Sweet and Spicy: 7.5/10"
5,Amazing food- came for brunch on a Saturday. Service was phenomenal and food was delicious. Their outdoor was very cute also. My favorite was the soy wings!!!! A must! Bulgogi rice was also yum
4,"Been here several times and I love their brunch menu (both sweet and savory) with a Asian-twist. I normally like ordering a few items to share (since the portions are quite large, and I&apos;m indecisive of what I like). The food here is flavorful and good -- some items do taste better than others but overall, they&apos;re pretty consistent. 

They also have mimosas (bottomless or cocktails) to heighten your brunch experience. I&apos;d recommend putting yourself on the waitlist before heading to the restaurant to avoid the wait. However, if you arrive there earlier, the restaurant is walkable to Fisherman Pier and Ghirardelli square. Give this place a try if you&apos;re looking for a nice and unique brunch-spot in SF."
4,"First of all, this restaurant is so pretty and cute! Me and my boyfriend were only here for outdoor dining but Can&apos;t wait to come back here once COVID is all over..so my total meal was about $80 Bc I wanted to try almost everything on the menu. Here&apos;s what I got:

Belly Bap (3/5): this really didn&apos;t live up to what we were expecting, it tasted almost as if it was just a simple Japanese dish rather than bibimbap. Like cha siu with unagi sauce I&apos;d say. So I think next time we would go with the other one they have on the menu ! 

French toast (5/5): omg this was SOOO good. I was scared it would be too sweet but it wasn&apos;t! And the caramel like sauce that came with it was the perfect addition to the whole dish. 

Lemon ricotta pancakes (5/5): this was so good too! They were light and unique. I ordered this as a side bc I had too many other things ordered haha

Matcha mojito (5/5): I surprisingly really liked this drink! It wasn&apos;t too strong and had that matcha taste. It almost tasted like a matcha lemonade, but it actually was one of my favorites! 

Jelly sake (4/5): this drink was pretty good as well but just super small! I loved the fresh fruits that came with it. 

Millionaires bacon (3.5/5): this was good, but I feel like I&apos;ve had better bacon elsewhere like kitchen story! 

Overall it can get pricey here, but the food is pretty good so I&apos;d say it&apos;s okay to splurge once in awhile. My favorites were def the lemon ricotta pancake and blueberry. I like that they have their own unique twist to everything. I haven&apos;t tried the egg Benedict&apos;s yet which will be on order for next time!"
5,"Overall, just soooo delicious.

Came here on a Friday for brunch. The cool thing is they have a yelp waitlist which is so helpful. You can add yourself as you&apos;re one your way there. When we came here, there was no wait and we got seated right away.

It was cold but they were super prepared! They had heaters next to all the tables and it made it so much nicer to eat outside. The outdoor seating is also very well done. The decor is really aesthetic and I was just overall impressed by everything.

For brunch, we ordered the Chicken cup bap fried rice, the blueberry crunch stuffed French toast, and the matcha latte. The latte isn&apos;t actually on the menu but the waitress was super sweet and made it for us. The food was phenomenal. I highly recommend the fried rice as it has their famous KFC (Korean fried chicken) in it.

Overall, great food, great vibes, and great service. I&apos;ll be back post-covid!"
4,"TLDR: Open for outdoor dining and great for brunch! It&apos;s a solid spot for Asian fusion brunch, especially with the properly socially distanced tables. I&apos;d recommend the pimped out ramen and millionaire&apos;s bacon if you haven&apos;t had a chance to check it out!

Food: 7/10
The food here is delicious! It definitely reminds me of Berkeley Social Club, down to the server&apos;s trademark Millionaire&apos;s Bacon tshirts. I got the pimped out ramen, which was definitely worth the photo and a tasty twist on shin ramen. 

Price &amp; Portions: 7/10
It&apos;s on the pricier end, but the portions are generous. 

Ambience: 8/10
A very cute spot that&apos;s all outdoors and pretty socially distanced! All employees were wearing masks and the tables were 6 feet apart.

Service: 8/10
The servers were friendly and came around a good number of times to refill our water. I&apos;d suggest a reservation if you want a spot for brunch (looks like they&apos;re generally at capacity for weekend brunches)."
5,Made reservations. Large patio. Very close to a lot of tourist spots - but still a very local vibe. Street parking. Great flavors. The overall stars they have speak for themself. Will come back for more of the Korean dishes next time. Thank you.
