5,"Tonight we ordered from here! Was Amazing. Everything was delicious- just as good as when we&apos;d eat there in person!

We had the Fish Tacos, chips and guacamole, rice and beans!  They have the best fish tacos! 
All that was missing was one of their perfectly balanced margaritas.

Truly a wonderful and special dinner. Fresh, beautiful ingredients- packaged perfectly so everything arrived warm and in-tact. And, packaging was minimal and mostly compostable, which is a big plus for me."
5,"I received wonderful service from Elvis, his recommendations were excellent- you must try the margarita with mezcal and fish tacos were fresh and light, not greasy. 
I love their outside dining creativity during COVID - overturned (new) metal trash cans covered with colorful chili peppered cloths. So creative, retaining their individuality, Elvis told me this is Lorena&apos;s work and she designed the inside (that I loved pre-Covid). 
So worth your time."
5,"I just want to start off with saying I&apos;m from Mexico and my biggest issue with eating Latin food is that it&apos;s never up to par. Some restaurants try to make it too fancy and take away the flavor and some go the complete opposite and it&apos;s not cooked properly or they add ingredients that just aren&apos;t part of the dish. Loló is the first restaurant in the US that is true to the food I remember. Everything on their menu gives you the comfort from real Latin food. Not to mention that the service is spectacular even during the pandemic. They have a bit of a wait, but it&apos;s worth it. Latin food has the rep that it&apos;s street food, which is partly true, but real Latin food is comfort food and I couldn&apos;t stop enjoying every bite. I&apos;m excited to go back"
5,"Lolo is one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco. My partner and I have eaten here countless times, at least 50 times - we used to frequent a lot in 2013-2016. One of San Francisco&apos;s Top 10 Restaurants for sure. 

From the infamous Taco Tropical to the Ceviche to the delicious Panko Avocado Tacos and  Lolo is a special place with unique, legit Mexican flavor. 

What else to order for dinner:
Guacamole
Tuna Tacon
Shishito Peppers
Carnitas
Refried Black Beans


They have a history of changing out the cocktail menu. We highly recommended trying a few while they are available. Sangria or a Margarita is always a great call here.

Right now brunch is closed but we recommend: 
Huevos Rancheros
Huevos Bravos
Chilaquiles
Chile Verde
Ceviche
Shishito Peppers
Guacamole
Panko Avocado Tacos"
5,"A perfect day: tacos at lolo, window shop down Valencia, and then head to dolores. Both the drinks and food here are phenomenal and the service was nice. The tacos all have quite a lot of sauce and are super worth it. Much better than some other overpriced taco places in SF."
5,No wonder this spot is always so busy - the tapas is delicious. Worth the wait. Best way to do it is family style so you get more variety. The fish tacos and beef quesadillas were so yummy. Plates were aesthetic and unique.
5,The pulled pork nachos and fried fish tacos hit the spot every time!
5,Omg where do I even begin. BEST TAPAS IN SF!!! This spot is always busy and it&apos;s because their food is amazing!!!
4,"Was excited to try the menu after hearing great things about it. Had sopas, fried avocado tacos, fish taco, and ceviche. Everything was good but not exceptional. Fish tacos were just alright. Avocado taco was good but lacked something. They just needed a little more. Maybe beans? I don&apos;t know. Sopas were great and were the highlight of my meal. Oh also I love dessert and the flan was exceptional. Would go there again but I&apos;d try some other dishes. The drink menu is also very creative and has some great cocktails."
4,"A very aesthetic Mexican restaurant located in the Mission.  I loved the interior of this place and a modern take on the food!  Out of all the dishes tried, I enjoyed the fish tacos the most.  The batter, sauce, and seasoning made it great.  A decent place to grab tapas! 
Ordered: fish tacos, pork belly tostadas, fried brussel sprouts, chips &amp; guac"
4,"We had a random adventure in SF and that&apos;s how I found this gem. Can I just say WOW? I didn&apos;t expect the food to be this good, atmosphere was very unique, and service was on point. We went during some time in October so the decorations looked like it was based on &quot;Día de los Muertos&quot; or the day of the dead. Which I really enjoyed.

The food that we ordered: 
-Ceviche (THE BEST CEVICHE EVER) - shrimp and rock fish citrus roasted pepper sauce and salted corn
- Huevos Bravos - horizo, serrano peppers, mexican style cream, spicy roasted potatoes
- Heirloom Tomato Toast (I honestly thought it was going to be a basic avocado toast, but it was so much better than I expected)  - sun-dried tomato, chive-infused olive oil, balsamic reduction over pressed sourdough bread
- Flan - Creme caramel
- Bunuelos (I would have given them 5 stars but this dessert was the only one we didn&apos;t like at all...It was kind of disappointing to end our food journey with this)- Fried dough strips, topped with cinnamon sugar and mexican vanilla ice cream, dulce de leche

Drinks we ordered:
-Perfect Stranger (our server recommended this and it was so good that we ordered another one and I usually don&apos;t like gin) - Ford&apos;s gin, lo-fi dry vermouth, oloroso sherry, lemon, jalapeño brine (clarified with goat&apos;s milk)
- 2 Birds 1 Stone - San Juan Del Rio mezcal, carrot juice, parsley, celery bitters, kaffir lime salt rim, served on the rocks

Our server was this short petite lady who was amazing from start until the end. Super attentive and her recommendations were on point. She also looks like Lucy Hale who played Aria from Pretty Little Liars! 

All in all, I definitely want to come back to try more things here, especially their cocktails!"
4,"Very interesting decor, there&apos;s a wall full of chihuahuas... Attentive service. They take the time to explain all the dishes if you ask. Looks like a great place for drinks, alot of people were just standing, crowded along the bar area. Seems like a fun spot to go for drinks on a date.

I heard this place gets super packed, and we didn&apos;t have a reservation, so I showed up a little before open for dinner and was promptly seated. 

Drinks are okay, but strong!

Diabla shrimp- not really spicy, but it was delicious! the texture was kinda gooey with the rice, but it worked out really well! the rice soaks up the flavors and everything melds nicely.

Ceviche- was pretty standard, and yummy! fresh ingredients.

Pork Tostada- I had to ask my friend to remind me what I had taken a picture of, so I guess this dish wasn&apos;t too memorable for me? Or maybe I was just too buzzed....It is an interesting take on a tostada, made to be shareable

At the suggestion of our server, we ordered the bunuelos (fried dough strips/ice cream) as our desert and it was not great. the ice cream itself was good, but its just vanilla. nothing special here. Maybe skip dessert when you come here!

Everything is plated beautifully here and its definitely a cool spot to take anyone you want to impress!"
4,"My friends and I were trying to decide on a place for brunch in the Mission, and when I found that Loló had been in my bookmarks for a while and also took reservations for brunch, it was an option I couldn&apos;t wait to suggest. Luckily everyone in the group agreed so I happily reserved a table for a Sunday brunch!

Food:
- Taco Tropical--$11
The panko and spice-dusted shrimp were so plump, tender, and hearty. The crispy exterior was paired well with the creamy and smooth spicy aioli. Another added complement was the subtle sweetness and freshness from tropical relish. I was intrigued by the use of a thinly sliced jicama for the tortilla, which added a crunchy texture and refreshing flavor. 
- Huevos Rancheros--$16
The blue corn tortillas were the perfect vessel for all of the other ingredients in the dish. The eggs can be cooked to whatever style you like, and the Oaxaca cheese sprinkled on top melted into the eggs making them even more delicious. The black beans were mashed so they were super smooth and creamy, and the avocado also added decadence and creaminess to the dish.

Tips:
- Make a reservation beforehand on Yelp!
- They have complimentary chips and salsa which they bring out before your meal."
4,"My husband really wanted to come here after seeing a ton of reviews about the Tuna Tacon. We asked our server and unfortunately it&apos;s only available for dinner!! We were pretty bummed but that just means we&apos;ll have to come back again at dinner time. However, it didn&apos;t ruin our first experience at lunch time. We tried the fish tacos and the panko avocado tacos. Both were AMAZING! The fish tacos had this delicious creamy spicy sauce on the side. That sauce with the flaky and soft cod fish was a match made in heaven. I especially loved the panko avocado tacos though. I&apos;m more of a fan of the flour tortillas. The avocado was perfectly ripened and creamy, and the pickled onions were a great addition of crunch and acidity. 

Service was okay, nothing spectacular aside from the very friendly hostess. It took a while for us to get our check until we flagged someone down who had to grab our server. 

It is on the pricier side, for $12 per 2 tacos, but the ingredients were fresh and you have to consider you&apos;re eating these in the middle of the city too on a very popular street. It&apos;s a smaller place too so the tables are super close to each other. We were just lucky that the table on our right was leaving right as we were seated, and the table on our left got moved into a bigger group so they were scooted closer to the wall away from us. 

These are probably some of the best tacos we&apos;ve ever had, so I&apos;m glad that we stayed here despite not being able to order the tuna tacon."
3,"Our group of three were first in line (no reservations) around the holidays to snag a table for dinner. Worked out for us and would recommend this tactic, as they&apos;re pretty popular! We each ordered drinks - margarita, one with strawberry rhubarb, and an incredibly smoky one. All were... fine? Nothing to rave about, but totally OK.

We definitely over ordered for three hungry girls:
All orders come with two tacos, so we asked to add a third, which came at the equivalent cost per taco. 

-Taco tropical (THE BEST. Shrimp and mango and all wrapped in jicama)
-Ceviche (literally three tiny shrimp and some really terribly fishy smelling white fish... might have been an off night but would not recommend)
-Tuna tacon (second favorite item, so clean and fresh and perfect!)
-Grillos Tostadas (the crickets were fun and the first bite of crickets and queso fresco was delicious but it was overall too salty and overwhelming)
-Special of the day, a fried chicken taco (well done but overall WAY too massive for us since it came at the end)

The portions are typically small - except for that fried chicken taco we got - and everything is a little more expensive than you might think.

The space is super cute and fun so it&apos;s definitely a prime date night spot. We probably won&apos;t return for dinner, but could see this place working out great for brunch."
5,"after all the amazing things i&apos;ve heard about this place, i decided to grab a bite to eat and was definitely not disappointed. the interior has so much personality and vibrancy with all the quirky and also cultural interior. there&apos;s plenty of seating and a unique layout and vibe. 

additionally, the menu has a nice range of cool dishes all that sound so delicious. the food here isn&apos;t something you can just get anywhere. i highly recommend getting the shishito peppers as an appetizer as they are tasty and 1 in 10 are spicy making it exciting. 

i loved the panko avocado tacos i got. they were incredible and the plating of the food is beautiful. i recommend getting a few dishes and sharing them. it is a bit pricey but not too crazy and definitely worth it!! it is usually pretty busy so expect a wait if you come during peak brunch or dinner time

the service was so friendly and i overall enjoyed my experience here and would recommend to all who are in the Mission District area!!"
5,Amazing cocktails and tacos. The tomato soup with meatballs is to die for! Great brunch spot!
3,"Food was good, server was really nice - 3 stars though for getting seated next to the trash"
3,"This place is just okay. Honestly not sure why all the glory reviews. Partially might be because we came for brunch and honestly it is surprisingly empty for a Saturday brunch place in Mission District that has 2000+ reviews so maybe this is a better spot for dinner. 

We ordered Taco Tropical (5/5) which is phenomenal. It is funny how much they are trying to fit on a tiny little wrap. My friend dropped like 1/3 of the stuffings when eating it. But the flavor is bomb! However, not enough to carry the rest of the disappointing dishes. 

Other things we ordered which I don&apos;t recommend are Chilaquiles (3.5/5) and Panko Avocado Tacos (3/5) and a cocktail which is like 2/5. 

This place has a fun vibe with a very interesting deco. But have to say I don&apos;t think I will ever come back to pay $30 per person for mediocre but over priced food."
5,"I&apos;ve been to LoLo a zillion times. I think the reason I come back is because of their camarones a la diabla. 

They put a modern twist to Latin American food and I really enjoy it. I&apos;ve had their tacos, meat or fish. I&apos;ve also had their tequila drinks that are to die for.

My biggest tip is to make a reservation because it is hard to get a table as it gets booked Asap!!!"
