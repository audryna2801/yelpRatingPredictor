5,"Located in the Outer Richmond neighborhood, Lands End Trail is a beautiful loop trail that has gorgeous views of the famous Golden Gate Bridge, features mother nature&apos;s wild flowers and is perfect walkers, hikers and is also dog friendly (leashed dogs welcomed).

Lands End Trail explores the historic Sutro Baths. Sutro Baths was one of the largest indoor swimming pool complex in the world that was once own by Adolph Sutro (former mayor of San Francisco and a very wealthy gentleman at that, who had once owned most of the land in San Francisco). The Sutro Baths had opened in 1890 and was meant for the working people of the city who were able to take a train to the ocean for a fun play day and enjoy the pools. Then explore the museum and eat at the restaurants on sight. Unfortunately, the Sutro Baths closed in 1966 and was burn in a fire in June of that year.

In 1980, the National Park Service ended up purchasing the land (but was originally planned to be developed into housing and a shopping center). There are free tours that you can check out if you would like to find out more information (and yes still going on during the pandemic, https://sfcityguides.org/tour/lands-end-sutro-heights/).

Anyways, Lands End Trail is a cliff top walk that is partially shaded and generally a dirt path (which was muddy on our visit). The trail does break off in different areas that you can explore that includes the Sutro Baths mentioned above, Eagle Point Overook (another place you see the Golden Gate Bridge), Mile Rock Beach and Land&apos;s End Point. You can easily spend a few hours here walking around the whole trail (~3.5 - 4 miles).

Lands End Trail is free, including parking. If you are an avid hiker and/ or photographer (armature or professional), you definitely want to make a visit. I came here with my husband and our little girl dog on a Thursday around noon. There was still plenty of parking, even though there were a good amount of people walking the trail. Other people did seem good about keeping their distance from others for the most part (although we did see several people did let their dogs walk off leash in front of behind them). We came here after spending a little over an hour at Ocean Beach, which is just down the street (also dog friendly and free parking available). Figured I would mention that in case you want to make a full day out of your visit here to this part of San Francisco.

Please note that the visitor center at Lands End Trail and restrooms are currently closed because of the pandemic (please also note that there are only a few restrooms at Ocean Beach so do plan accordingly for your visit)."
5,"Feels weird reviewing a trail for service, but dang, this trail is beautiful. 

Clean, spacious, and everyone on the trail (except for a few runners who were pushing it REALLY hard) wore a mask. 

There are some really great views here, and I had no trouble finding a parking spot nearby (no tickets, either). 

This is a great trail for those new to the area or visiting - there are some amazing views of the GG and the bay.  The trail is not overly challenging, though if you have some challenges with elevation (stairs, slopes, etc.), you might find some sections a bit tougher than others.  I definitely noticed my hams a bit worked the next few days.

After the trail, head down to the overlook for some great views especially round sunset."
5,"This place will always be a classic for me. The scenery, environment, and low difficulty of the trail will always make Lands End trail a top recommendation of places to try for tourists and friends. Bonus if you love doggos of all shapes and sizes because you will probably see one every couple of minutes of walking :)

Connecting Sutro Baths and the Seacliff area, I recommend starting off at Sutro Baths where you can take pictures and enjoy the scenery first. Then hike up the land ends trail, enjoying dogs, scenes of the Golden Gate Bridhe, and sounds of nature, and once you reach the end, you can take the 38 bus through the Richmond and stop anywhere to eat some good food to recharge your batteries. A great way to spend half a day in beautiful SF."
5,"I was told that Lands End was a pretty easy walk and it was for the most part except for all the stairs! This is pretty much a straight trail along the water with some turnout points with really great views of the Golden Gate Bridge! I got lucky and came on a really nice day so the water and the bridge were looking good in pictures! 

The nice thing about this trail is there&apos;s a lot of things to look at along the way like the sutro baths, the water of course, bridge, labriynth and all the different trees that put shade over the path. 

The paths are kind of of the narrow side so I would go earlier to avoid the crowds because it started having more people around 10:30am on the weekends."
5,"Absolutely love this trail and the views. It&apos;s a great hike, steep one and you will find some really nice rock work and art on your way to different trails and viewpoints 

We did this trail first time due to the Cotopaxi race and I still remember we forgot the time ticking for the race and just sat down to relax and enjoy those gorgeous views. 

The parking around this place is never a problem! Pack your snack, the closest cafe is closing soon too!"
5,When you want quiet and a fun area of the City!
5,"10/10 would recommend a sunset picnic or walk over at Land&apos;s End. I have grown up in the Bay and was so surprised that I had never come here at sunset to enjoy with friends and family. Located up around Sea cliff, this hidden gem is honestly one of the cutest places to enjoy incredible views. There is so much space and countless lookout points making it convenient to walk along the trail and see different views along the way. 

I came here with my cousin who lives a few blocks inland of Land&apos;s End. We had a nice stroll over before the sun set and then walked along and snapped photos as we went. My favorite thing about this place is how you can easily see both the sunset on one end and the GG bridge on the other end. Slowly as the sun goes down, pink hues fill the sky and shift over to the bridge...such a beautiful sight. 

I am definitely going to bring friends to come hang here when they come to visit in the future because man it really shows off the Bay!

If you drive into the city, this place has a big parking lot so don&apos;t worry about parking. Also, if you have more time, I have heard great things about the Labyrinth that can be reached with a short walk from the general walking trails. 

Because there are so many people (especially with COVID given leisure activities are more limited), make sure to bring a mask and keep it on! I saw a number of groups hanging out at the lookouts with large parties (families and kids) where the kids and adults were unmasked because they weren&apos;t walking. I understand the want to unmask but also be aware that others are also sharing the lookout points. 

Please please check this place out if you live in the Bay and have not done so already. Such a wonderful memory and glad I was able to capture some awesome pictures to remember it!"
5,"&quot;A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality&quot; - Lennon 

I&apos;m always up for adventures - be it half a world away or in my backyard and Lands End Trail never gets old. I&apos;ve wandered these pre-colonial paths many times in this lifetime and in previous lifetimes too. Ansel Adams was inspired here and so were the poets, artists, believers and dreamers of the San Francisco Renaissance. 

Lands End Trail is located on the coast of San Francisco. There&apos;s many starting and ending points, so I won&apos;t confuse you. Many tourists and locals tend to forget about it or simply don&apos;t know about this stunning hike. Yet, here she sits open to all to enjoy her stunning natural beauty just miles away from all the skyscrapers. Great for a stroll or take it up a notch and connect to other trails and keep going to sunset.

The history here sets it apart from your typical hike. The Yelamu Ohlone tribe called Lands End home before Spanish genocide began in 1776. These Native Americans thrived on hunting, fishing and gathering. The ruins of Sutro Baths and the memorial to the USS San Francisco can be discovered here too. 

On my journeys to Lands End Trail I love the scenic views of the Bay. The Golden Gate Bridge at a distance and the Marin Headlands as a backdrop - breathtaking! 
Pack a lunch and enjoy the chaotic beauty of the Pacific. Mother Nature at her finest! Don&apos;t forget to visit the Labyrinth by Eduardo Aguilera and dream the day away! 

In the end, I highly recommend Lands End Trail in Northern California. Great for families, lovers, and daydreamers! It&apos;s safe for a beginner (where you can stop and turn around at any point), yet endless enough to keep the more advanced hikers happy too. I can&apos;t wait to visit her beauty again and dream away..."
5,"A beautiful hike with ample parking and fantastic views! This is a must see place if you have visitors coming from elsewhere and it&apos;s a clear day! The hikes aren&apos;t bad at all and you can go as far or short as you want. 

The trail connects the Legion of Honor all the way to the Sutro Baths with many little sites, beaches, and trails in between. My only warning during COVID is that a lot of people go on a nice day so just remember your mask and social distancing!"
5,"aMAZEing views

Aside from the obvious tourist attractions, this tops the short list of must-sees in the city, especially considering it is unaffected by the pandemic and the only poop you&apos;ll see is inhuman and the only needles are falling from trees. 

The rock maze is not really that amazing, but it seems to delight and engage all ages as a quirky detour along the nicest coastal hike in the city.  With views of the Golden Gate in the background, the circular maze is a cool little photo OP.  Especially for dishonest and very short Instagram influencers who can claim they&apos;re at  Stonehenge. 

To find the labyrinth, exit the lot toward the trees and follow the signs to Mile Rock Beach.  After the first set of stairs down, go right instead of taking the second set of stairs, watch your step, and find your way down  to the other side of the Lion Kingish rock hill obscures the view of the labyrinth. 

PS. For more information and photos, search Lands End Labyrinth or Point Lobos Trail...it appears on Yelp under different names. 

Lands End Rocks!"
5,Oh what I never reviewed this trail? One time I actually saw whales in the distance. You can all the way back into town and enjoy it while you walk. It&apos;s gorgeous! Nature is amazing.
5,A must see part of San Francisco.  It&apos;s a nice walk along the coast with magnificent views of the Golden Gate Bridge and the coast line.  It&apos;s a little steep at parts and there are some stairs but it&apos;s a good 1.5 mile or so walk.  It&apos;s free and there are numerous places to park.  Near the golf course is good and a parking lot is at the other end near the cliff house restaurant.
5,Very nice area in San Francisco with gorgeous views of the bridge. We started at sutro baths and wandered all the way to the Palace of Fine arts traversing this trail and some sidewalks at the presidio. There were also many stairs that allowed you to go all the way down to the rocky beach that was well kept. The trail itself was not too much physical labor (only about 3 miles) but if you do all the &quot;side quests&quot; it can turn out to be quite a hike. My legs definitely hurt from climbing so many stairs at the end of the day. There&apos;s also some areas of the trail where you are less shielded from the wind so definitely remember to bring a windbreaker!
5,"Beautiful scenery!!!!! I was impressed how clean the park is and there is  ample parking available.  Not enough trash bins.  The bins needs to be changed out. But overall a very clean and beautiful location to visit for locals and tourists. 
Very kid and pet friendly.  Saw plenty of families enjoying the time out and wearing their face masks."
5,"First time today - great coastal scenery and a tree-lined dirt/sand trail.
Went to see the Labyrinthe (see the pic).
   **Note:   There were quite a few wooden/packed sand stairs, got quite a workout ascending them on the return trip.  But it was worth it!
   Trail on the right:  rocky, be careful w your footing.
   Trail on the left:  easier, has wooden/packed sand stairs and also leads down to Mile Rock beach.

Decided to turn around before the steps to Eagle&apos;s Point.

Parking:  the lot just past the Cliff House on the west
side of the Great Highway was filled when we returned at 11:00 a.m.  But there was a lot across the street.
  By history this location has had lotsa car break-ins, as the sign warns visitors, but I didn&apos;t see any trouble today (a Wednesday, Nov. 11, 2020).
Restrooms:  the visitor center was closed and no porta-potties.
Water:  bring your own.
Footwear:  wore running shoes but hiking boots would&apos;ve helped on the rocky path to the Labyrinthe.
Dogs:  They&apos;re allowed!  I saw only one person who didn&apos;t have their dog leashed.
Masks/Covid:  most hikers were masked but there were more than a few who feel it&apos;s a hassle for them. Keep your vapor cloud to yourself!!!

Worked up an appetite, so went to Tartine bakery and La Taqueria afterwards.  Long wait outside at Tartine, only a 10 min wait at La Taq for the best burrito and quesadilla in town."
5,"Being a lifelong bay area resident due to Covid, I&apos;m discovering a lot of places I never knew existed. We came here on a Sunday and there was lots of parking available. (I gather during the summer/tourist months, non-covid that wouldnt be the case). The walk was a combination of paved and dirt trails. There were also some stairs. Most people were wearing masks but you will walk by lots of people. Some runners as well. We came on a clear mild day and the views were spectacular. If I entertain out of town guests, I would bring them here."
5,"What a beautiful trail! Hiked this at the end of June and was expecting the weather to be warmer. The views are supposed to be amazing on a clear, sunny day. When we went, it was chilly and extremely windy (apparently, those are the conditions most of the time, so bring a jacket.)

The hike is fairly easy and the entire loop is about 3.5 miles. My favorite part was taking the stairs down to the beach."
5,"Fun trail and it wasn&apos;t too windy :) be careful of not putting things in your car since there&apos;s a sign that says break ins are common.

The trail wasn&apos;t too hard and there&apos;s quite a bit of stairs so if you don&apos;t like stairs, this probably isn&apos;t the place for you. Most people on the trail was wearing masks and the view was great :) it was foggy so the golden gate was mostly covered but still super relaxing and great place to check out :) there was also this little cute heart shaped rock :)"
5,"A classic, must-do hike in SF! Short and easy with incredible views of the coastline and bridge. I&apos;d plan on spending at least an hour so you can soak in the views and take some photos. It gets very windy, so bring layers.

It gets pretty busy here, so I&apos;d recommend coming during non-peak times."
5,"We meant to go to the Lands End Labyrinth, but instead we had a lovely walk on the trail here. It was gorgeous just taking in the scenery, and it was empty being a Tuesday afternoon. Especially during the pandemic, it was just refreshing to take in the beautiful nature and fresh air! Plenty of parking at different points which is great for SF!"
