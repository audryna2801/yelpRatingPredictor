5,"I have been here only twice with a decade between the visits, and it does not disappoint! 

This is written during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Yet the bright ice cream spot with its bright bluish paint shone bright like a gem amidst the tumultuous sea. We had just weathered a storm with flash floods, mountainous landslides, and felled trees, but today was a sunny day - perfect for ice cream. People were enjoying the sun at the iconic Dolores park on Dolores St, people were mostly safely social distancing, people were dancing or doing yoga to loud music, and police were roaming sundry londs and offering masks to boost public safety. 

I highly recommend the Ricanelas flavor! Orange cardamom was really strong-smelling too! Tis&apos; seasonal though.

Oh, this is one of the very very very few establishments to reach 10,000 Yelp reviews - legit. So for future reference: mine is around #9654 or #9655!"
5,"COME HERE!!!

I got a flight with a waffle bowl/cone $10 

honey lavender 8/10
- sweet floral with hints of mint 
- one of my favorite ice cream flavors

creme brulee 10/10
- wow amazing!
- THIS IS MY ALL TIME FAV HERE
- creamy and smooth with toasted sugar bits in it (just like a real creme brulee!)

black sesame 10/10
- creamy, nutty, roasted flavor 
- the second best flavor here
- tastes like a black seasame tangyuan in ice cream form!

brown sugar 9/10
- Didn&apos;t really taste the brown sugar but still creamy and delicious!
- for those who are wondering, no...it doesn&apos;t like the the brown sugar boba ice cream bars at the Asian market 


Overall, this might be my most favorite ice cream place in SF! Definitely worth a try! Will be coming back in the future! 

As for COVID, they allow one guest inside at a time and you line up 6 ft apart outside the store."
5,"Believe the hype, Bi-Rite Creamery is worth the visit for ice cream! 

I only come here for their salted caramel because it&apos;s just that good! I&apos;ve been visiting this location every time I&apos;m in SF and on my recent visit, my boyfriend and I didn&apos;t have much time to explore, but I knew I had to stop by one place to make my trip well worth it, and that was getting ice cream at Bi-Rite Creamery!

Parking
Just like anywhere in SF, parking is a pain and it will be the same situation when coming here. My advice, be patient, drive around the area and you&apos;ll be lucky if you can find a spot in 30 minutes, but if not, it&apos;s okay, just have patience :) 

Covid Safety Precaution
Currently, they are not offering indoor seating. It is always crowded here so there will be a line out the door. The line moves pretty fast. You&apos;re required to wear a mask once you enter the store and all the staff members are wearing masks, as well.

Shop Vibes
The inside shop is really cute with random things you can buy such as books, t-shirts and pins with their logos. The shop isn&apos;t very big and with half their store closed, space can be pretty tight but they do limit a certain amount of people inside the store so it won&apos;t feel crowded.

Flavor
Unfortunately, I&apos;ve only tried the Salted Caramel so I can&apos;t judge the other flavors. But for the Salted Caramel, I give it a 10/10. Just trust me and try that flavor at least once."
5,"One of the BEST ice cream places ever. Whenever in the city, it is a definitely must try. Cold or hot day, try it! If I could give them more stars, I would. 

All the ice cream flavors are very creamy and really pack a punch of flavor. Consistent with every bite, and it might even get better and better with each. My friends and I shared the honey lavender, earl grey, and black sesame. To be honest, even when the flavors melted together--the flavors were still really good. 

Counting the days until I got back! So delicious!!"
3,"Someone has to explain this to me because I really didn&apos;t get it. 
One of our guests had to have this for Thanksgiving so I drove to the mission to pick up a few quarts of the salted caramel. The butterfat content is so high since it&apos;s made from buffalo milk so it never freezes all the way which was off-putting for me. I love ice cream more than anything and the flavor was great but the melted texture made it so unappealing. I worked in India over a long span of time and LOVE buffalo milk, so I thought this was going to be something I would like. 
It seems like a popular hot spot so it must be a favorite to a lot of people. 
I&apos;ll give it another try again sometime."
5,"Bi-Rite Creamery is nothing less than fabulous! 

This is a family favorite and a must, every time we are in San Francisco. Originally, the ice cream was a small part of the market which is located across the street, and has done so well, that the creamery was opened many moons ago.

Prepare yourself for excellence. The creamery offers well over a dozen different ice cream flavors at any one time. This isn&apos;t your run-of-the-mill creamery either. There is a reason that there is always a line to get into the recently refurbished store. Be patient, it&apos;s so worth the wait!

The house made chocolate with infused olive oil over it, is one of my favorites.  Yes, you read that correctly. Infused olive oil. It&apos;s a must try, and if you are a foodie like I am, don&apos;t pass this by.

They always carry some of their basic popular flavors, but they do have seasonal changes, and the creamery uses locally sourced products for their creations. You can order ice cream scoops, ice cream in cones, sundaes, and even ice cream cakes.  Generally, the ice cream cakes are pre-ordered, and great for any celebratory occasion. 

Salted caramel, crème brûlée, Orange cardamom, Blue bottle coffee, Roasted banana fudge, Meyer lemon, Earl Grey, honey lavender... And so much more. This is just a small list of some of the amazing flavors, and all worth trying!! 

If you love ice cream, this is an absolute must! If you are a foodie, this is an absolute must! If you love trying new things, this is an absolute must!  You will thank me later..."
5,"This place is legendary!! High quality ice cream and one of the best in the nation. The vanilla, salted caramel, mint chip just top notch. Cannot go wrong here. The hot fudge sundae is one of the best around!"
4,"Service was excellent,  super friendly and nice people. 
Many ice cream favors choices
We got sm cup $5 - honey lavender &amp; malted vanilla,  I like the lavender, and malted vanilla has nuts in there that. It&apos;s not expecting. 

Also got a soft serve $5 with waffle cone, super creamy and rich and I love it, I love love their waffle cone, its crispy and yum, not overly almond favor.  One of the best I had in a long time. I highly recommend , and all ice cream suppose to made with Buffalo milk 

What I don&apos;t like was, the line is right next to the outdoor dinning area, which u are standing next to a group of ppl wearing no mask eating ice cream next to me, make me very uncomfortable and feeling very unsafe waiting in line."
5,"I don&apos;t know why I haven&apos;t even reviewed this, but as you can see, it&apos;s a must try. Their ice cream is perfect for a cold and sunny day! They have a variety of flavors and some have great texture if you&apos;re into that. If you get the small, you can get up to 2 flavors if you&apos;re feeling bold and beautiful. I do suggest getting two flavors just to have options lol. But this place is always a must when I&apos;m in the city."
4,"Take Out during Covid-19
Overall: 7.5/10
Wanted to eat milky ice cream so badly and some people said this is a must try in SF. It is not bad but not the creamy ice cream I want. They got an option of a pre packaged pint for 10 dollars or small cup for 5 dollars and they do taste the same.

Earl Gray flavor: 8/10
Wow try this!

Salted Caramel Falvor: 7.5/10
Unique but not my favorite falvor.

Black Sesame flavor: 7.5/10
I prefer those Japanese black sesame flavor in Japan town over this one. Probably because I have an Asian taste."
5,"Finally got a chance to visit one of the most famous ice cream shops in SF. We went on a weekday and I was the only customer at the time. Ordered a make your own sundae with two scoops and two toppings. I selected the pumpkin cheesecake and I really don&apos;t remember the other one, and hot fudge and caramel iced banana as topping. Also bought a pack of cake cone and the salted caramel pint cup.

The flavor of pumpkin cheesecake was heavenly and took up most of the flavor of the sundae. Loved the toppings with the ice cream scoop, along with whipping cream. I expected the scoop to be a bit more though.

I ate the salted caramel ice cream with the cake cone. The cake cone is small size and a good choice for people who like small serving size. Salted caramel is yummy and has a coffee taste. The one thing I noticed is the texture, which is really good!"
5,"One of my husband&apos;s favorite places in SF and possibly on earth!!! I think he had ice cream there for breakfast and lunch!!!!  I don&apos;t get how he can have two meals a day at an ice cream shop but their salted caramel is always on point. We have been there about a dozen times now. (I am sure that you figured it out if you did the math when you were reading the review, twice a day x5-7 days for a typical week long trip:P Luckily for me, he does not do this when we are not traveling and we do not keep any ice cream in the freezer.) 
I had black sesame seed icecream that they have sometimes but not all the time but it was very good for me to crave. Havint Bi-Rite Creamery to visit is a definitely a plus when we are planning on a trip to SF."
4,"I like to go there this place to get ice cream . Been here lots of times and I finally remember to review it. It&apos;s a great place to get unique flavored ice cream in 
San Francisco. It is a good way to expand your horizons on different flavored ice cream. Good to grab some and enjoy at Dolores Park."
5,"I came here many moons ago and the salted caramel + honey lavender didn&apos;t impress me so I haven&apos;t been back since.  After all these years I decided to give bi-rite another shot and I have no regrets.  There were so many flavors I wanted to try and was even considering getting a flight for myself but ended up playing it safe and got a single of the peanut butter swirl + roasted banana. Both flavors were excellent. I love peanut butter in general but the chocolate pieces inside really added nice texture. I also love natural banana flavor, not that artificial stuff, and the roasted banana delivered on that.  Eating a bite of both flavors together was just a match made in heaven.  In retrospect I should&apos;ve gotten a medium to add the birthday cake but I guess I&apos;ll just have to make a trip back!"
5,"Great ice cream spot with fun flavors! I love that you can try 2 flavors even if you order a small. I tried the orange cardamom and earl grey seasonal flavors. The flavors were well-balanced and not overpowering, and the ice cream was nice and smooth. The staff was very upbeat and friendly too!! Next time I&apos;m going all out and ordering a flight.

There was a line on a Saturday afternoon, but it moved quickly. We grabbed our ice creams and sat in Dolores park to enjoy them. A perfect afternoon!"
5,"This creamery is worth the hype! We&apos;ve visited Bi-Rite twice now and loved the service and ice cream both times. 

The ice cream is really well made. It&apos;s very creamy and packed with flavor. This time around I got chocolate caramel crunch and mint chip. My boyfriend got birthday cake and all the ice cream was great! It&apos;s also reasonably priced, too. 

Pro tip: if you&apos;re thinking about getting a waffle cone/bowl, GET IT! I got a waffle bowl with my ice cream and I can&apos;t even tell you how fresh and crunchy and actually tasty it was! 

Due to covid, only a few customers can enter the shop at once, so there is a small line that forms outside. The nice part is that they have a small outdoor seating area which is perfect for a cute quick spot to enjoy your ice cream right near Dolores Park. 

We usually visit Salt and Straw when we visit the city, but their lines are very long. We&apos;ll definitely come back to Bi-Rite because we&apos;ve had great experiences each time! :)"
4,"This ice cream is good, it&apos;s my go to when I&apos;m feeling a bit boho/hippie and one with nature. Lavender Honey to be exact."
4,"Tried their infamous balsamic strawberry flavor and I gotta say it was surprisingly good! I don&apos;t usually like fruity or acidic flavor (sorbet) when it comes to ice cream, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one and I do get where the hype comes from. However, I feel as though the texture of all bi-rite ice creams is not as dense as I wish. But this shop still remains as one of my go-to ice cream spots when I&apos;m in the Mission neighborhood!"
5,"Who doesn&apos;t enjoy ice cream in the winter? Okay, maybe just me. There are social distancing markers on the floor. Only a few people inside at a time. No sampling because of Covid-19, boo! Staff was helpful helping me pick flavors that would go together. I ordered the chai tea latte with black sesame in waffle bowl. Both delicious! Support small businesses!"
5,"I havent been to Bi-Rite in YEARS. We are often in the area early in the day for a morning bun from Tartine. But with this latest trip back home to the city during a heat wave, Bi-Rite was most certainly the answer. 

Known for probably the finest salted caramel ice cream known to man, we decided to go there since we were in the area and the weather was heating up for the day. Shorts weather in the city in Sept?? We luckily found parking a few steps away and we got in line (socially distanced with markings on the floor). I hadnt had lunch yet so I was looking for lighter flavors, maybe even a sorbet. I was about to try the balsamic strawberry until I saw a handwritten sign on the glass that said POPSICLES. Whatt?!? It was perfect popsicle weather. The sign was highlighting a Bronx Grape popsicle and I was sold. As soon as I ordered it, the guys that were scooping ice cream were stoked and pointing to the cashier saying she dipped them by hand herself. How awesome! I knew I picked the right flavor even before tasting.... 

Once I did, I was like WOWW.... It was so good. Perfectly sweet grape flavor, perfect ice crush texture, perfectly refreshing, perfect for the heatwave that was going on at the moment. I know it seems like such a reach to say that a popsicle was great but it truly was. It was the spot-on cold treat I needed at that moment. My only regret was not getting 2. I contemplated getting in line again for another one (the line was much longer now) but relented. We were going to try and make it the next day before our flight out but we never did.... So bummed. That popsicle was so good.

Thanks for never letting me down Bi-Rite... In that 90 degree (SF!?) heat, you were the bees knees. Be back, be home soon."
