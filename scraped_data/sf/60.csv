5,"Nice cafe and place to buy beer, wine and snacks.  The coffee is very good.  I had the Turkish style and tried the pistachio baklava.  All very good.  A wide variety of beer and wine. Staff was friendly.  

This business is safe and clean about social distancing."
5,"Friendly staff, great Turkish coffee (mmm), and a solid place for me to quickly grab a fresh bag of coffee beans. Open for the greater part of the day, with sanitizer for folks coming in front and an amazing selection of snacks, drinks, and wares (think pasta, ramen, canned goods, milk, butter) in the back. All of my favorite specialty beers are available here too!

It&apos;s only a half block from me, so I&apos;m tempted to go back often. You know what - I think I will. Their drinks are well priced and they have some pretty amazing baklava."
5,Great wine and beer selections for  COVID conscious--hand sanitizer around every corner.
5,"I was visiting UCSF and desperately needed a cup of coffee that wasn&apos;t crappy hospital or hotel coffee. A simple search here on Yelp showed that this place was the obvious choice. The person working there highly recommended trying the Turkish coffee. I was a little skeptical because I usually like my coffee loaded with syrup but was pleasantly surprised by the rich flavor of a Turkish coffee. Plus the amount of caffeine in it was a huge bonus. Food was decent too!
Now I&apos;m a little obsessed with Turkish coffee and have been trying to find some in the Fresno area with no luck. If anyone has a suggestion throw it my way! 
Anyways. 5/5 stars easily. Pleasant staff, great coffee and deserts, and a cute reading nook for when they open the inside."
4,This cafe has lots of reviews. The store owner took over and he works at the shop everyday. They have a special Turkish coffee. I got the iced Turkish coffee and it was fun and pretty good. They have hot chocolate. The menu is neat and it has a small grocery section. It&apos;s a neat cafe near UCSF and it&apos;s hidden but clean and organized.
4,"When my boyfriend and I came in, seems like we missed Sam! Sam definitely seems like a very nice man and I would&apos;ve loved if I got some life advice from Sam.

Anyways, my boyfriend and I were in the area after an event at the Golden Gate Park. My boyfriend yelped a coffee shop and Golden Bear Trading Company popped up with lots of great reviews! We had to try it.

I ordered an Iced Chai Latte with soy milk, while my boyfriend ordered the Iced Turkish Coffee. Mmmmm! We both enjoyed both drinks! The only downside is that the cups are pretty small and pricey. However, we both enjoyed the drinks, the customer service, ambiance, and what the store had to offer! The store sold bottled drinks and wines as well. 

My boyfriend and I need to come back to try their baked goods. I kind of regret not trying the Baklava. Oh well, until next time!"
4,"Great spot for quality middle eastern desserts and coffees, with a huge wine and beer collection. &quot;The secret to my success is me!...No liars thieves and gold diggers! I back it up with 100% quality and cleaning.&quot; Says the owner with gusto. It has been here in his family name since 1913! Best local place around here, be prepared to try the family recipes whether you come in here wanting to or not!"
5,"I&apos;m the cookie monster when it comes to Baklava, so when I saw their window sign saying &quot;Best baklava around&quot; I had no choice but to slide in to see what the hype was about! Fantastic turkish style coffee, great hot or iced!! And yes, the baklava is as bomb as they say!! I come here at least once a week to enjoy a coffee n baklava to go along with my afternoon at Golden Gate Park, friendly staff and also great selection of wines, stop by next time you find yourself at the park!"
5,"I have been going to golden bear for a year now. I always have an amazing interaction with the staff, and get there delicious Turkish blend of coffee. I still come back to the sunset after moving away just to hit this spot. Its a classic!"
4,"One of those mom and pop shops that rarely exists in a city like this any more.

If you want a quiet coffee or wine moment to yourself this is not the place for you.  The owner is a charismatic and brash character that defines this space.  This comes from a place of pride in his establishment and old-world hospitality mixed with your uncle giving you a hard time.  So expect to feel welcomed but also hassled a little bit.  It&apos;s like experiential theater in your coffee shop experience.

There are plenty of options to choose from so take your time with the menu, but he will certainly try to help you along with suggestions or advice.

I had a Mexican hot chocolate and met a friend for a chat before dinner.  Perfect spot for window people watching on the street and enjoying the afternoon.

Please come support these rare and amazing one of a kind local businesses when you can.  This is a primarily cash establishment."
5,"Honey Bear is so yummy! We came in today for some eggs, cocktail mixer and sweets. Ed is a nice guy and you can tell he takes a lot of pride and attention to his store. The new grocery section is really handy w flour, garlic, pasta, sauces, ramen and salted butter!"
5,"Amazing service and coffee! Had both the Turkish brew method and turkey red sea pour over. Both were  flavorful and delicious. Baklava was delicious too, not overly sweet."
5,"Go see Sam for life advice. Literally gave me the best advice compared to my therapist. &quot;Have it Sam&apos;s way if you don&apos;t like it fuck you all! :)&quot;

Also the coffee is good :)"
5,"One of the few treasures in the US is Sam at the Golden Bear trading Company. Sam stokes a fire of positivity in his customers&apos; day by providing sassy and certain points.

And the coffee is good too"
1,"Pros: ??? Still thinking about it.

Cons: 
-Overpriced
-Rude weird owner
-Coffee WAS good but NOT ANYMORE!

DON&apos;T WASTE YOUR TIME! EVEN IF ITS YOUR LAST RESORT. It&apos;s not worth it.

I have tried this place a handful amount of times. Only because at one point the coffee was good, even though having to brave it up to walk in there. I say that because the &quot;owner&quot; Sam is very pushy and rude and thinks he is funny with his side comments and noises he makes. 

And now his coffee SUCKS!! i don&apos;t know what or why he changed things up. but its no good. First they downsized the serving of coffee, when asked to fill it to the top as usual he had something to say. &quot;its quality over quantity!&quot; I mean I&apos;m a paying customer?? Fill it to the top! and second all the coffee grounds is sitting at the bottom of my cup and floats around, it sure didn&apos;t have the same quality as before! And not to mention i ordered 3 coffees. His comments and his way of being is just so pushy. To top it off I paid $14. for 3 less then 4oz coffees! wait i mean 3oz of coffee and 1oz of coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup!!

Its just so disappointing! I will for sure not be returning and encourage the rest to not waste time and money."
5,"What a wonderful experience! Best coffee I have ever had! Try the a Turkish coffee! Ed the owner was kind enough to give me a taste of the iced Turkish coffee, out of this world! The regular house brew is also excellent! The baklava is great, I love the free samples !!"
4,"I&apos;ve never had Turkish coffee before today and I&apos;m glad I tried something new. It was very malty and different from other coffees I&apos;ve had. Also, met and talked with the owner who is friendly and knows coffee! Cute little spot too. They have a little area where you can borrow a book and or even drop one off."
5,"Heaven starts here, with this man! Amazing Brazilian mocha

I have been coming here since 2007 and this place will always have a place in my heart. No other coffee shop can compare. SF original."
1,"Somehow my review from ~ 1 year ago got deleted from Yelp, so I am reposting. I&apos;d been here several times before and it was ok: good coffee but curmudgeony service. Came here with my friend - who was having some family issues - for coffee &amp; a chat. She ordered a latte, I ordered a Turkish coffee.  The owner Sam suggested she try a Turkish coffee too. She said &apos;no thanks, I would like a latte&apos;. We paid &amp; sat outside.  He brought 2 Turkish coffees. I thought he gave a Turkish coffee to try for free. She asked when her latte was coming.  He insisted she&apos;d ordered Turkish coffee - which she did not. He started yelling at her, she started yelling back through tears. He was still yelling as we left. Why am I reposting it a year later? We just had coffee again. Every time we have coffee in the Inner Sunset she mentions our terrible experience at Golden Bear and we laugh."
2,"I&apos;ve come here for a coffee or two and found the experience just okay. When I walk by I often find it&apos;s empty or with one patron. Prices are higher for what is essentially simple fare, such as a cup of coffee. Owner can come off opinionated and seems like a proud person. At times they have a much older lady serving."
