5,"Really reminiscing about Burma Superstar on this rainy day because nothing is better than some Chili Lamb or Chicken Curry Daal on a cold day. 

With the pandemic I haven&apos;t been lucky enough to catch outdoor dining at Burma which kills me because my boyfriend and I come here at least twice a month normally! It&apos;s a serious neighborhood gem and there is 100% always a wait. We developed a Burma Superstar super seating strategy! Check Yelp within the 1 1/2 hour before we wanted to eat dinner and then add to waitlist accordingly. This food is so good it&apos;s worth the wait. I&apos;m almost hesitant to say how good it is because I don&apos;t want to make my wait for a table even longer when they&apos;re allowed to open! 

For your takeout meal right now I recommend their samosa, the tea leaf salad, the chicken curry daal, the chili lamb, the walnut shrimp and the coconut rice! 

While it&apos;s been awhile since I&apos;ve been able to dine in or take out I&apos;ve been trying to stay connected to my Burma family with their official Burma Superstar cookbook! Only $20 and helps bring a little taste into your own kitchen. 

Fondly waiting to be back on a foggy San Francisco night!

I should mention: they have two other Burma Superstar locations! One in Oakland and one in Alameda. We&apos;ve hit the trifecta and our definitive ranking of Burma Superstar&apos;s is as follows:

(1) San Francisco
(2) Alameda
(3) Oakland"
5,"One of my favorite restaurants in SF and a place I find myself returning to every time I come home. During the pandemic they have been a consistent option for takeout and we are never disappointed. Our favorites on the menu include: tea leaf salad, rainbow salad, sesame tofu, garlic chili shrimp and the coconut rice (a MUST get with any entree)! We usually get some other dishes to supplement our faves, but always come back to these. An absolute SF gem!"
5,"I highly recommend going early right when they open for lunch or dinner to get served quickly OR ordering online to pick it up! We ordered the garlic noodles, fiery chicken and vegetables, garlic and chili shrimp, tea salad. Don&apos;t  forget to order a side of rice if you need rice with your meals like I do. Everything came out fast, service was great and COVID safe, and food was so flavorful, saucy, and delicious!"
1,"Absolutely CRIMINAL.

Their meal was one of the most expensive options out of all the available meals, in all the available restaurants, and for $17.50 I got a plastic pint container with 6 shrimp and a hand full of walnuts plus another pint full of rice. 

They also made sure to put the Mayo sauce container INSIDE the pint to further take up space.

EIGHTEEN DOLLARS 
Screw you, you bunch of CROOKS."
2,"I am still not sure why this place is so popular. I have been to this place only twice and both times It wasn&apos;t what I expected. The tea leaf salad did not feel fresh and wasn&apos;t as tasty as some other places I have tried.  The wait time was okay but it was quite a bit of time before the food showed up.

The mint chicken did not have a lot of mint in it and the sesame chicken was a bit sour. The roti seemed to be deep fried and the dip was pretty mild tasting with no chicken in it.

After reaching home, my stomach kept me up till late with a lot of gurgling noises. There was urgency to use the restroom the next morning. My friend had a harder time with upset stomach the next day.

Never coming back here! There are other much nicer Burmese restaurants in the city!"
1,"We have been going to Burma for years.  We love it.  Tonight&apos;s meal was inedible and it was such a disappointment.  The sauce on the Pratha and the coconut curry actually tasted like fish and flour and we couldn&apos;t even eat it.  That was after we waited 55 minutes.  When we arrived for pick up they hadn&apos;t even made our order yet...and when we tried to call them, they wouldn&apos;t pick up the phone.

GROSS disappointment!"
4,"Burma Superstar is definitely good...but to me, it&apos;s not the best Burmese restaurant in the city. Maybe I&apos;m just bitter about how hard it is to get a table and how expensive it is haha

I&apos;ve tried their tea leaf salad, rainbow salad, nan pia dok, fiery chicken, and curry, and my two favorites are the rainbow salad and beef curry. Most recently when I ordered online, I actually ordered the rainbow salad but was given the tea leaf salad and didn&apos;t even realize until I had gotten home. Regardless, my friends and I enjoyed the meal and even had some leftovers.

Great option if you&apos;ve never had Burmese food before!"
4,"Not bad!

Tea Leaf Salad 8/10
$15
- the vegetable to nuts/fermented tea leaf ratio was off in my opinion 
- there was almost no nuts and beans in mine 
- really little fermented tea leaf and it was mostly lettuce and cabbage 
- flavors were there tho! 
- doesn&apos;t taste super authentic like what my parents would make but this is probably the closest I&apos;ll get without going back to burma! 

Eggplant tofu curry 7/10 
$17
- I thought they would use the chickpea (yellow bean) tofu but it was bean curd cake !
- flavors were good
- tastes like sweet sardines!
- really flavorful and worth a try 


Chili lamb 7.5/10
$23
- can&apos;t adjust spice level but not very spicy (I&apos;d place it at a mild to medium) 
- lamb was soft and flavorful 
- flavors were all there and stir fried well 

Overall, they need another cashier at the front because it was hard to place orders in person (or you can place them online and pick it up -- I didn&apos;t know till I got there). The lady at the front was really busy. They followed all COVID protocols and even sanitized the credit card before using it! This place is pretty good but like most places, it is definitely westernized. I would still come back though!"
4,"Burma Superstar is a staple of the San Francisco restaurant scene. Famously know in the past for the massive waiting lines to enjoy their tea leaf salad and other Burmese food, it was worth the wait (for the patient ones).

With Covid things changed a bit and it is now fairly easy to eat here. They had an outside seat area (which now is again temporarily closed but hopefully opens again), and you can also order and pick it up to go.

My favorite dishes are:
1. Tea lead salad (you just must..)
2. Basil Chili Pork Belly
3. Chili Lamb

Enjoy!"
5,"I&apos;ve never had Burmese food before coming here, but I&apos;m so glad this was the first place I tried because it set the bar so high! 

My go-to&apos;s every time I go:
- Mango chicken (with coconut rice): sweet, savory, and spicy. The chicken is tender and juicy and it&apos;s absolute perfection with coconut rice. Would highly recommend this!
- Eggplant with garlic: soft and tender eggplant cooked in a garlic sauce- what more could you ask for
- Nan gyi dok: noodles bathed in a sauce that&apos;s both refreshing (from the lime) and savory from the curry"
4,Samusas are like Indian samosas. It&apos;s a crispy shell with potato filling and some spices. This is the Burmese version of samosas. I want to try tea leaf salad and maybe a noodle dish sometime. People like this restaurant. Maybe it&apos;s a bit overrated for Asian food.
2,"Every time my fiance and I visit the Bay Area, it is a tradition of ours to have at least one meal at Burma Superstar, and we kept the tradition even during the 2020 pandemic times. Since this is one of our favorite spots to visit, I really wanted to provide some feedback so the restaurant can continue to improve and adapt to Covid times. 

We visited on October 16, 2020 for the Tea Leaf Salad and Nan Gyi Dok takeout, and the in-person ordering process was smooth. They have plastic draps inside that keep the staff and customers at a safe distance. For a weekend, the restaurant is quite busy, so do anticipate a 30-minute wait-time, take a stroll around the neighborhood to checkout other local businesses to support on your next visit. 

My feedback is mostly for the pick-up process. Although there are signs posted on the walls on where to go depending on the type of pick-up order (ie: phone-in, walk-in, UberEats, Door Dash, Grub Hub, Postmates, etc.) at night the signs are quite difficult to see and makes it confusing to patrons where to stand to wait for a table, place or pickup an order. I noticed when some customers inquired where they were supposed to be standing, the stressed-out staff gave a hasty answer, which could come across as impatience and may make the customers feel like they are a nuisance. I would recommend maybe assigning takeout orders a number, and when the order is ready the business can text the person what time and which window to pickup. 

Lastly, as for the food, I felt the portions are a bit smaller compared to dining in, which is understandable as businesses have to absorb the packaging costs now. The Tea Leaf Salad was a bit more oily than we remembered, and one of the nuts, either the the fried yellow beans, sesame seeds or peanuts seemed to be over-fried and had a overpowering bitterness with each bite. The business also never asked if we needed utensils, so we had to go back and ask for some, as we were eating our meal in the car for social distancing. 

Overall, the pandemic takeout process for me in October 2020 was not as smooth as I hoped for and I feel has room for improvement. But I can tell the staff are busy and working hard to keep the business running."
4,"Only snagged a couple blurry pictures since I was starving  

Got the beef curry, garlic noodles, tan tan noodles, pumpkin curry, etc etc...

The garlic noods were bomb! The tan tan was okay, I prefer a little more bite to my noodles. My favorite part was actually the platha and dip! Was so dank, I could just eat a plate of that tbh."
3,"Firstly, they&apos;re handling covid great. Even sanitized my credit card when paying. 
Overall, I have to say- a little bit overrated. I&apos;ve heard so much hype around this place but it definitely was just like any other Burmese place in the city.
The lamb chilli, and the tea leaf salad were pretty good in my opinion. Lamb was cooked well and had a good flavor to it. The tea leaf salad had a great balance of nuts, veggies and dressing! Yummy dressing (not too strong on the tea flavor which I liked)
The garlic noodles were meh okay. Didn&apos;t really taste any garlic. 
The paratha and dip is an absolute NO. The platha was so so oily, we felt a little gross after eating it. The dip was pretty plain compared to some of the other coconut dips we&apos;ve had."
5,"Our favorite south asian restaurant in the SF Bay Area. Well run, kind staff, delicious dishes made with fresh ingredients and much care."
5,"I literally haven&apos;t stopped thinking about Burma Superstar since I ate here last night for dinner. As an LA local, I&apos;m confused and grief stricken as to why they don&apos;t have a Burma Superstar down south??!

This restaurant doesn&apos;t take reservations so if you&apos;re dining in, be prepared to wait a bit (unless you show up before they open). Service was pretty good, they&apos;re super busy so make sure to be patient with the employees. Food was phenomenal! The dishes were a mix of familiar flavors but so unique at the same time. This was my first time having Burmese food and it seriously blew me away. 

Tea Leaves Salad (L): So flavorful and fresh! Leafy veggies were all super crunchy and the tea leaves made for such a unique and savory flavor profile. Loved all the crunchy toppings as well, the juxtaposition of all the different textures made this salad so addicting. 10/10

Firecracker cauliflower (S): Think orange chicken, but cauliflower instead, and 200x better. Breading was so flavorful and crispy even though it was covered in a delicious sweet and sour sauce. So simple but SO good. This dish blew my mind. 10/10

Fiery Vegetables with Tofu (L): Spicy stir friend veggies with chewy slices of tofu. Loved the tofu, so bouncy and delicious. Everything was super flavorful and cooked perfectly. 9/10

Eggplant with garlic sauce (L): I always love when eggplant is cooked super soft, so delicious. The garlic sauce was delicious as well but I wish this dish was a little spicy. 8/10

Coconut Rice: The little essence of coconut in the rice makes such a delicious difference. The fried onion/shallots on top are a great addition as well. Rice is also a little softer than normal rice, almost slightly mushy? It works though! 10/10


We also got drinks: thai tea, singha beer, and three flowers tea. Paired perfectly with all the food. I&apos;m so sad that I have to go back to LA today, definitely dropping by again when I&apos;m back in the Bay Area. 100% recommend this spot for a unique and delicious fusion of flavors."
5,"Ordered food for takeout ! 
Personal recommendations include 
1. Veg samosa 
2. Tea leaf salad 
3. Garlic noodles 

Pick up experience was really smooth (contactless) with all necessary guidelines"
5,"I could survive on their coconut soup alone. I actually think I ordered it three days in a row, but for the sake of science (and supporting local) I&apos;d be willing to go seven for seven. 

It&apos;s the Oh Noh and it&apos;s a delicious chicken, coconut, sweet affair that&apos;s warm, comforting, filling, and incredibly more-ish. One bowl is always more than enough but I do love the coconut rice so much I normally pig out on that too. We&apos;re in stressful times so the extra calories help. 

I keep getting chided by friends to try the tea leaf salad so my December action plan is to make my way through the menu. If I can put a pause on the soup... go enjoy this place is amazing!"
4,"The wait here is cuhhhrazy always. It&apos;s a tiny restaurant, but amazing for Burmese food. I&apos;ve experienced both dine-in and to-go here. 

I believe you can put yourself on the Yelp waitlist (pre-COVID) so you don&apos;t have to wait outside too long. This is nice because you can stroll around the area and avoid having to wait outside in the cold.

My favorite things are the mango chicken, tea leaf salad, and coconut rice. Tea leaf salad is a MUST at any Burmese restaurant. Add the shrimp paste too! They typically mix all the ingredients in front of you which is nice. I&apos;d also get the nan gyi dok (my fave noodles to get at any Burmese restaurant) when I have more of an appetite.

Burmese food is great! You gotta try it if you already haven&apos;t!"
5,"This is my go-to place for Burmese food in SF! You can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu. My favorite dishes are the Nan Gyi Dok and the Tea Leaf Salad.

During COVID they offer take-out and you can order on Uber Eats/ Doordash. The pick up experience is fast and easy."
