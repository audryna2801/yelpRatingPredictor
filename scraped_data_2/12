5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.

Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."

4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed.

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."

5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered.

5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."

My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.

5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."

Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."

The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."

5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."

I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."

5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting.

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus.

The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."

The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one.

The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."

4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.

Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."

4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed.

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."

5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered.

5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."

My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.

5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."

Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."

The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."

5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."

I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."

5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting.

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus.

The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."

The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one.

The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."

4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.

Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."

4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed.

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."

5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered.

5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."

My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.

5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."

Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."

The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."

5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."

I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."

5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting.

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus.

The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."

The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one.

The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."

4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.

Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."

4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed.

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."

5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered.

5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."

My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.

5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."

Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."

The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."

5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."

I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
5,"Omg. So good. 
Got the jumbo Portillo and cheese fries. I would go again and again if I lived near by. It was perfect, fresh good flavors. Fries were perfect texture &amp; flavor. Cheese wasn&apos;t too thick or runny. Just get it. They are very covid safe, extremely spaced out seating."
4,"When I was passing through Chicago I stopped here because it got great reviews.

At first the place looks amazing because of the cool decorations inside. It is very orderly with the structure of the line where you enter, exit, and where to pick up your food. The place is so big you also had a separate section to pick up your call ahead orders. I can imagine this place gets packed during weekends, holidays, and busy nights.

I should&apos;ve glanced at the menu before I went because there was a lot to take in. However, I was here strictly for the hotdog. The lady helping me asked me if I wanted fries and I thought, I can&apos;t think of five reasons why not! So I ordered fries as well.

There were social distancing policies in place everywhere so I felt safe. Markers on the floor sanitizer by the exit and condiments and proper instructions as well as people helping, if you wanted to or not, so no one could mess up this set up.

I stood to the left of where I ordered and there&apos;s a rope separating where you order from where you pick up the food. It took about five minutes so I thought that was relatively quick. When they called my name I showed them my receipt and picked up my order. On my way out I grabbed the condiments I needed (ketchup for the fries and napkins) because they didn&apos;t give that to me. I think the operation is set up real well because they seem to be efficient.

Food review:
The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and hot and soft in the middle. They were seasoned well but not over seasoned. You could tell there was a hint of salt. They were crinkle cut so that&apos;s always fun.

The hotdog was pretty good. I must say if you don&apos;t like the snappy Ness of the skin and hotdogs being boiled you probably wouldn&apos;t like this one. I honestly went in not knowing what to expect. I think what makes a &quot;Chicago hotdog&quot; so special is the toppings and the bun that they use. The bun was poppyseed and it came with the following toppings: a long pickle, mini hot peppers, mustard, onions, and 2 slices of tomato. It was appetizing and went well together.

Next time I go I want to try the beef and cheddar, the jumbo hot dog, or the sausage. I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re in the area."
5,"Always a good spot to hit up when we are hungry in the city and want a quick cheap meal. 
The way they had the lines and air to wait for your food spaced out for social distancing due to COVID was a plus. 
As always we enjoyed their hotdogs and Italian beefs.. and didn&apos;t skip the chocolate cake shake!"
4,"Consistent food w. the Skokie location (my personal OG Portillo&apos;s locale). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been inside this one. I utilized the drive-thru twice the past couple weeks and it was a fine oiled machine. 

All workers had masks on and I had mine on in my car as well when interacting. 

They keep the car line pretty organized so it was decently fast both times even though the line was like 10 cars deep. 

I usually get the hot dog w everything on it and chicken tenders w honey mustard - those are my go-tos! Sometimes I&apos;ll add a cheese fry order or a cake shake or a chocolate cake. 

I did get the fish sammich as well one of the times. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ordered that in years. I think I&apos;m going to just order it without bread next time and turn it into a fish and chips situation."
2,"I&apos;d give them 4 stars for just the chocolate cake shake, but they delivered it without the requested straw.

Also. They don&apos;t have veggie dogs and as a special f you to those who want that option, they serve a bun with just toppings. 

I can picture some grumpy old man owner just not ready to include vegetarians in his customer base. That&apos;s okay brother. You&apos;ll come around."
3,"Ah is it bad to say I thought Portillo&apos;s was alright?? I feel terrible saying that as I know it&apos;s a classic to Chicago. Maybe it was the fact that I hyped it up in my head that I ended up a little disappointed. The main components of the hot dog were the pickle and the radish on it. 

I do think that my dislike for pickles also played a big factor in my judgment. Overall, it felt like an average hot dog to me, but I can see this spot being poppin during non-COVID times and late night Fridays/Saturdays when everyone had the drunchies"
5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."

5,"I have a love for this place, I can&apos;t review on anything beef or pork related as I don&apos;t eat either, but they rest of foods I&apos;ve tasted is delicious. Also, I love their beer selection and the fact that all their beers are served in frosted glasses."
3,"When I was visiting Chicago, I knew I had to try Portillo&apos;s since it is famous for their hot dogs. However, after having the hot dog and the cake, I&apos;d definitely say it&apos;s just a mediocre fast food chain. Nothing too special but more of a tourist spot if you just wanted to try it. I definitely liked the chocolate cake though because it was not overly sweet, which I really like. Other than that, I&apos;d only recommend this if you were more of a tourist."
1,"Terrible customer service they always forget items
 Of my orders. I&apos;ve been here for 3 days in a row and each day there is always something missing !! When you call they just hang up on you!!!!!"
5,"Service was great, and they are super fast. I tried their chopped salad and it was delicious. Everything Tasted fresh, live the bread that comes with the salad. What I liked about this location is that they also make pasta dishes."
4,"Best hot dogs I&apos;ve had in life. Only thing I would say negativity which I way I docked a star is the drive thru line. The push yiu through.  So make sure you know what you want when they get there, they arent to friendly. 
As for the food!!!! I got a Chicago style, and a onion and cheese hot dog, Chocolate cake milk shake. The hot dogs were amazing, the combined the ingremadw me nervous im glad I got it. So good. The milkshake was good to. It was made with choice cream and chocolate cake blended in. I loved tasting the accake in the shake."
4,"When in chicago, I had to try some unique foods of chicago. I read about this place and had to grab an Italian beef sandwich and the chicago style hot dog. 

Beef sandwich: it was pure bread and beef, if you want toppings/fillings, you have to pay extra. The beef was super juicy that if you don&apos;t eat the sandwich right away, the bread gets mushy. However, the flavor was spot on, definitely a heavy sandwich.

Hot dog: I like this a lot. I love the combo of relish, tomato and all the other fillings that was in it. I can see myself eating this daily.

Price was reasonable and service was pretty quick. We were in and out within 3-5 minutes after placing our order"
3,"What can I say ? This place is classic and has everything under the sun you&apos;d want to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. Only problem is due to COVID precautions there wasn&apos;t any indoor seating or seating in general (all Togo). So by the time we got home to eat it the bun was sopping wet. Other than that everything was tasty. Also got the chocolate cake shake. It wasn&apos;t very good. They didn&apos;t blend the cake enough so it was literally a milk shake with large chunks of cake in it lol. Didn&apos;t know what else to expect. I thought it&apos;d be smoother."
5,Love this place since I was a kid. I think it&apos;s a good spot for tourists to try a piece of Chicago without having to venture off into the inner city.
5,"Visiting from California, we aimed to try some quintessentially Chicago cuisine. Portillo&apos;s is the place! We ordered the Chicago Hot Dog, the Polish dog, and the  Italian Beef sandwich. They were all delicious. My personal favorite was the Beef sandwich, which was so juicy that the roll was quickly soaked (making it even better, if that is possible.) My teenage son loved the Chicago style hot dog most. The toppings were crisp and fresh, perfectly complementing the beef hot dog. We definitely recommend Portillo&apos;s when you are in Chicago."
5,"A whole slice of cake in a shake? Yea .. 

Any establishment that can stuff a cake inside of a shake gets 5 stars in my book. The shake is absolutely delicious. Do not come here if you&apos;re not willing to indulge."
5,I usually don&apos;t throw 5 stars around too easy especially at a place where I was just expecting to be a tourist destination but it delivered. I went for the regular beef (it was lunch and I would have needed a few naps if I are the big one) a cheese cup and the fries. Fries were nothing to ride home about but the sandwich was delicious. Juicy and super tasty! Good to the last bite basically and was perfect size. I&apos;m glad I live nowhere near this place bc I would eat it too much
5,"First time visiting this spot in Chicago but the Maxwell was on point. Juicy, well done and soft bun. The onions and mustard were great compliments to the sausage. Will definitely come back to try the chicago dog. If your in the Chi-town area and in need of a good dog/sausage fix, portillo&apos;s it is."
3,"Why is there so much hype about this place? I walked 25 minutes to get here, to build an appetite. And oh boy, did I. I was actually recommended to come here for the hot dogs and the beef sandwich. I ordered a chili cheese dog, beef sandwich with peppers, and a coke. 

You guys... Have you ever had store packaged sausage? It&apos;s the same. Nothing spectacular. The chili was okay, but there was barely any cheese. The bread was soggy also. I was not impressed. 

Moving onto the beef sandwich. Yes, there&apos;s a heaping amount of beef, but there was barely any flavor. Bland ... The peppers helped quite a bit, but my bread was so soggy, the texture is like dipping bread into water for 20 minutes. What&apos;s the deal with that???

It was okay. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t come here again. Service lacked, but there was plenty of tables in distance and the place was very spacious."
4,If you&apos;re in Chicago and just craving some fast food and when I say fast I mean fast then this place is right for you! They make food really fast but also their hot dogs are one of my favourite. Soft bread with tasty sausage or beef or anything you like. They also serve salads btw. Last time I took Char-Grilled Italian and it was yummy as before. It didn&apos;t even changed. Don&apos;t expect something extraordinary from this place it&apos;s very good for a fast bite nothing more but as a fast and tasty hot dog spot it works very and very well.
