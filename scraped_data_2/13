5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

Check out my review on my foodblog: https://bit.ly/38Pa89u"
5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"

4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

Check out my review on my foodblog: https://bit.ly/38Pa89u"
5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside.

Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

Check out my review on my foodblog: https://bit.ly/38Pa89u"
5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff.

We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful.

They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

Check out my review on my foodblog: https://bit.ly/38Pa89u"
5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.

5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.

5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

Check out my review on my foodblog: https://bit.ly/38Pa89u"
5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"

My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier.

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"

The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

Check out my review on my foodblog: https://bit.ly/38Pa89u"
5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it.

Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

Check out my review on my foodblog: https://bit.ly/38Pa89u"
5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush.

I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!

We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

Check out my review on my foodblog: https://bit.ly/38Pa89u"
5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."

They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

Check out my review on my foodblog: https://bit.ly/38Pa89u"
5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal.

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

Check out my review on my foodblog: https://bit.ly/38Pa89u"
5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.

5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.

5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

Check out my review on my foodblog: https://bit.ly/38Pa89u"
5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"

My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier.

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"

The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

Check out my review on my foodblog: https://bit.ly/38Pa89u"
5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it.

Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

Check out my review on my foodblog: https://bit.ly/38Pa89u"
5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush.

I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!

We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

Check out my review on my foodblog: https://bit.ly/38Pa89u"
5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."

They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

Check out my review on my foodblog: https://bit.ly/38Pa89u"
5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal.

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

Check out my review on my foodblog: https://bit.ly/38Pa89u"
5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.

5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.

5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

Check out my review on my foodblog: https://bit.ly/38Pa89u"
5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"

My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
5,"Got the dinner for 2 takeout special. Everything was fantastic! Awesome deal-appetizer, salad, 2 pastas and a dessert for $55. Very generous portions and so delicious."
5,"I ordered the &quot;Deluxe dinner for two&quot; to go for date night at home, and let&apos;s just say this will not be the last time the deliciousness of Sapori Trattoria will be gracing my table...what a deal!  Only $55 for one appetizer, a salad, two pastas, and a dessert. The pasta choices come from their main menu, and are full sized, so this is a great deal considering most of their pastas are between $20 and $28 each. 
My bf ordered the gamberoni e broccoli (shrimp with linguine, broccoli, and veggies) and I had the pasta contanido (shells with Italian sausage, rapini, onion, and cream sauce). I did not try the gamberoni (I&apos;m not a big fan of seafood in pasta), but my bf said it was excellent. My pasta was amazing!! It was the perfect amount of creamy- just a really delightful pasta. Both of these dishes were easily a pound each! I will have lunch for at least 2 more days. We chose bruschetta as the appetizer, and this was the only part that was underwhelming. The tomatoes were watery and the crostini were soggy.  However, the meal also came with a lovely warm fresh loaf of bread along with some Parmesan cheese, so we threw some olive oil and balsamic on a plate with the cheese and went to town with the bread, and it was delightful. We also chose the rustica salad- Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, avocado, cranberries, and an avocado ranch dressing. I really enjoyed this salad too, it was very tasty. 
Finally, the bread pudding for dessert! I stuck this in the oven on the &quot;keep warm&quot; setting when we got home, so it was the perfect temp when we were ready to eat it. It came with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce, and was a great cap to a delicious meal. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this takeout and will definitely order again to try some other pastas. The way everything was packaged made it super easy to set up and eat at home. One of my favorite takeouts of this pandemic so far!"
5,"We were fans of Sapori before COVID and not surprised that our dinner at home was fantastic! 
Seriously for what people spend on delivery anyway, just order from here. We got the dinner for 2
Caprese
Caesar Salad
Chicken Alfredo
Rigatoni Bolognese
Tiramisu 
With a bottle of wine.


Probably the best dinner we&apos;ve had delivered in all our years of dining at home.
Can&apos;t wait to try more!

Seriously Chef Anthony this was delicious! Keep up with those fun videos!"
5,"I have not had the opportunity to dine in, but we ordered delivery from their website and it was a breeze. They have a $55 deluxe dinner for 2. It&apos;s worth it, considering most of their pastas are at least $20. The portions were quite generous!

Our selections: Insalata Rustica Salad, Roasted Tomato Caprese, Pennette Cardinale, Gamberoni e Broccoli, Homemade Tiramisu

We were a bit disappointed they forget the chicken in the Pennette Cardinale, but there was an abundance of shrimp in the Gamberoni e Broccoli. The shrimps were so big and juicy, tasted like lobster!! Both pastas were great, and we had enough to make 3 meals out of them.

The salad and caprese were fresh, and the homemade tiramisu was so moist and not too sweet. I can&apos;t wait to try other items off the menu!"
4,"It was such a treat to dine here with an old friend in August on a Friday evening last August 2020. I heard SO much about this place since I started living in Chicago so I was super excited. We were able to get parking easily! The staff were so kind upon arrival, and they sat us next to an open window and gave us recommendations. 10/10 on ambience and staff! 

We chose the lobster ravioli and the penne cardinale. This is where I dock just one star because the pasta was good but not drool-worthy. However, the serving size was amazing for the price you paid, I ended up having leftovers for two more dinners! 

I&apos;d still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Italian outing!"
5,"&quot;When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...&quot; It&apos;s amore!  

Sapori Trattoria is buono, delicious. Sapori is an upscale yet casual neighborhood restaurant that serves traditional Italian dishes and comfort food. This was my first time dining here and after my experience it will not be my last!

5,"This was probably our favorite delivery that we have ordered during COVID so far. We got the Deluxe Dinner for two and it was fantastic. We chose the Roasted Tomato Caprese, Stella Salad, Gnocchi Pesto Brivido, Bucatini Carbonara, and Panna Cotta. I was a little worried about how a carbonara style pasta would travel, but that was the highlight of the meal for me. The gnocchi were delicious as well and the pesto sauce is quite good without being too heavy. The dressing on the stella salad was great, and some bread came with the meal as well. Perhaps the only let down was caprese salad, so I might rather choose a different appetizer next time. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again and if the weather cooperates perhaps it will be on their patio beneath a heat lamp!"
5,"I had the best dining experience of my life here, especially during COVID. They came with bottled water, individual olive oil and Parmesan packets with the bread which is so thoughtful and added so much to the dinning experience. There is also a bunch of outdoor seating and it&apos;s really cute! 

After many suggestions from the best waiter, Omar, I decided to make my own dish with their homemade vodka sauce, penne, spinach, and crumbled sausage. It was the best pasta I&apos;ve ever had, I can&apos;t wait to come back. 

While we were eating, it rained lightly (which didn&apos;t bother us because the food was so good we were distracted), they gave us 2 free desserts and extra warm, fresh bread to take home. I&apos;ll be thinking about this experience for weeks"
5,"The Zuppa is my absolute favorite dish and a must try if you love seafood, red sauce and fresh pasta. They offer in a half portion but who says no to leftovers when it&apos;s this delicious? The amount of seafood you get is seriously unreal. My husband likes the chicken ternana and always finishes his plate clean. The warm complimentary bread is a great start too!"
5,Got the burrata puliese for an appetizer and the pasta contadino for a main. The pasta dishes were so big you could even share! Our waiter Tony was the best. So sweet and did an amazing job. They even brought us out an amazing dessert after our meal. 10/10 would come again.
5,"Great food, friendly staff, the our door seating is quite nice, feels very summery and almost make you forget this whole pandemic. 

Each person gets their own bottled water, very nice, and their own pack of olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

Fried calamari is light, tender, cripy on the outside. Add a touch of lemon juice with their in house marinara sauce, i literally couldn&apos;t stop 

Food is very well portioned, very hearty. My friend had the meat ball and sausage pasta which she had spaghetti replaced with their homemade pasta. Both meats are juicy, tender, well seasoned and very delicious. It has that meaty flavor that satisfies any meat lover when you bite into it. 

Lasagna is so well put together, it forms a small pouch sealing the ingredients in; keeping everything moist. Also helps everything stay in place when you cut into it. The seasoning is the right amount for me which is on the lighter side. It really brings out the flavor from the ingredients. The sweetness from the tomato, with that little bit of tang and the savoriness of the meat. The creaminess from the cheese and if you want a little more saltiness I recommend a bit parmesan on top. Definitely one of the best lasagna I&apos;ve ever had. 

One thing tho, the side walk is slanted at an angle. So the tables are slightly tilted. Doesn&apos;t effect the dining experience but if you prefer tables flat then sit inside. 

They also told my friend and I that they don&apos;t accept groupons till next phase when I called. But they accepted it from the table next to us... so some clarification on groupon would be appreciated."
4,"I have visited this italian cuisine restaurant with a couple of my friends recently I did like their Covid precautions, public was distanced from each other and all the staff were wearing masks. Tables seemed very much clean, I also hope that they sanitize them after each customer. The most thing I liked was Carbonara. The sauce was mild with buttery  taste. Tiramisu was pretty trivial, sometimes I take such from a supermarket"
4,"We went here on the last day before indoor dining was closed and it was quite hectic. Not sure if it&apos;s the norm, but we waited 45 mins after our reservation time.

Once seated, our waiter was very attentive despite the busy night so that was a plus. He brought us extra bread when we asked for it, and the bread was warm and tasty.

My guest said his mussel and scallop pasta was very good, and was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of scallops. 

My meal was less flavorful but we both had very large portions- definitely enough to take home.

I tried the French martini, and it was pretty strong in my opinion but tasted okay."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Sapori before but this strictly for Restaurant Week. I felt this was worth the experience because the menu was $36 for an alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree. 

During Covid they have a phenomenal take out deal dinner for two. You get an app, dessert and two entrees for an amazing price. I recommend the lasagna, the serving is enough for two or for one and then some leftovers. This is my go to spot for Italian."
5,"I&apos;ve been going here for years and have determined this is the best italian in Chicago, yes I said it BEST. It&apos;s not often I repeat restaurants but this is the type of place you bring all your friends and family, because it&apos;s that consistently good. Whatever you get on the menu is A+ but my go to is lasagna, ossobuco, and stella salad. Do not miss this place!!"
3,"2.5 stars. I don&apos;t understand the hype around this place. It was slightly awkward when I walked in. The host stared at me for a couple seconds before asking if I had a reservation and then went &quot;uh...okay how many in your party?&quot; It felt uncomfortable and unwelcoming. My friend and I shared the Bucatini Carbonara and the Rigatoni Caprese. I liked the bucatini more because it had more flavor and aroma, and was cooked well. The rigatoni to me lacked flavor, it just tasted like some sauce was watered down and glazed over. The pasta itself was cooked nicely, not too soft, and the cheese wasn&apos;t overwhelming. The food was decent. 

Several times, the servers tried to take our plates away when we weren&apos;t even finished. They took the salt and pepper, or whatever else was on the table away before we were even finished with our meal. It felt like they just wanted us out of there. Well, no problem I won&apos;t be returning."
5,"I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. My partner and I ate NYE dinner here in their outdoor pods with gas heaters and were celebrating our anniversary. Firstly, the host was incredibly polite and patient and had us seated very quickly although they were very busy with their carry out dinner rush. Our pod was outside but the heater inside of it was very powerful so much so that we were able to take out coats off and even at a certain point we had to unzip the pod to let some cold air in. Our waitress (was a dark haired woman - we forgot her name) and the gentlemen who brought us the wine were both doing an amazing job. Our meal was incredible, we had the fried calamari (super fresh and crunchy), the carbonara (delicious and creamy), and a chicken dish with mixed vegetables in a creamy, flavorful sauce. They gave us dessert on the house which was their panna cotta and my partner and I had never had it before but very much enjoyed it.

I&apos;m very happy that even with Covid, we felt safe and isolated from other customers and the staff. Their staff will not enter the bubble unless absolutely necessary and when they do they&apos;ll never step inside but rather reach in with your food or to clean off the table. They all had masks on the entire time.

Our waitress was so hospitable, pleasant, and kind. I&apos;m very impressed by the quality of service and the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back here!!! Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
5,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this restaurant. They stay up to date with the covid restrictions and do whatever they can to make the outdoor dining experience more enjoyable. They currently have igloos outside, which are so fun and warm! Most recently we started with the fried calamari and it was perfectly salty. I have tried a few of their pasta dishes and so far my favorites are pasta contadino and the pennette cardinale. The portions are also huge! I got the chicken parmesan to take out a few weeks ago and I made 3 meals out of it. This place is definitely a neighborhood charm."
5,Amazing food both in the restaurant and takeout/delivery! The carbonara is outstanding.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants now in the city!

Came with my girlfriend for a date night/to participate in their restaurant week. It was my first time but she recommended it to me so we gave it a go! 

To first timers who dine Sunday - Thursday&apos;s, there&apos;s free validated parking at the Home Depot parking lot! Just make sure to tell your waitress/waiter at the end of your meal for the ticket. I believe it&apos;s valet Friday&apos;s and Saturday&apos;s. 

Greeted and seated instantly (we had a reservation but still very prompt). We were given the menu and started off with a lemon drop martini and a beer.
They give you a bread basket (always a plus) with a dish of cheese and will refill if they see it empty/upon request!

As a part of their restaurant week, we ordered:
 - mussels in a white sauce and fried calamari as first course
- linguini alle Vongole (linguini and clams) and the spaghetti allo Scoglio (seafood spaghetti) as second course
- tiramisu and the hazelnut panna cotta as our third course

Everything was honestly amazing. I wish I remembered our waiter&apos;s name because he was really nice and tentative even as the night got busier. 

We will definitely be back! They give you little comment cards to fill out at the end and my girlfriend has received some paper coupons in the mail that will definitely get put to use. Can&apos;t wait for another visit!"
