5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."

We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."

5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes

4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"

- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error.

4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that.

5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"

I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich.

- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again!

I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that.

5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."

4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"

5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."

It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that.

5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick.

The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce.

While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood.

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that.

5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"

The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."

Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that.

5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."

We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."

5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes

4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"

- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error.

4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that.

5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"

I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich.

- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again!

I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that.

5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."

4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"

5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."

It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that.

5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick.

The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce.

While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood.

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that.

5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"

The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."

Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that.

5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."

We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."

5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes

4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"

- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error.

4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that.

5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"

I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich.

- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again!

I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that.

5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."

4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"

5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."

It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that.

5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick.

The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce.

While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood.

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that.

5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"

The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."

Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that. 
Jackée"
5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that.

5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
4,Great mexican food. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had. Short rib tacos were fantastic! The service was amazing. But I don&apos;t know if they are currently open or closed. Anyway you will not be disappointed by their menu.
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
5,The spicy churro sandwich is a must and also loved the Tortilla soup! Waitress was very friendly
5,They are following all cdc guidelines. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered to go and got it super fast. The outdoor seating is super cute too. I ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. It was insanely delicious. What a great idea and combination 12/10 would order this again. It was indeed spicy too.
4,"I picked up 3 tortas and 3 churros to-go after a day at Erikson Institute, just down the block. 4 pm on a Friday was a good time to come as there was only one person in line. Counter person and host were friendly and efficient. 

The waiting area is awkwardly placed by the door, so I had to keep moving while guests came in and squeezed past me into the dining area, but I didn&apos;t have to wait too long. 

$48 for my tortas take-away, without sides, is steep so I doubt I&apos;d return, unless it&apos;s a special occasion, but I&apos;m guessing $12-$13 a sandwich is the going rate in the city for a fresh, handmade sandwich. Too steep for me though, especially with no sides, as my teen eats a lot and one sandwich wasn&apos;t enough. My family enjoyed their sandwiches though. My son ate two tortas and my husband ate one. I&apos;m gluten-free and vegetarian, so I didn&apos;t order anything for myself. 

Xoco is a cool and unique place for a quick meal. It&apos;s out of my regular budget, but if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend a visit."
5,"We were here recently for lunch. We got the chicken and short rib tacos, a Xoco salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was good."
5,"Doesn&apos;t look like much when you pass this place maybe because you have so many cool restaurants near by or next to it. But if you don&apos;t want to try anything sophisticated and like tacos, this is the place you need to go to when you&apos;re in this neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood and always keep trying new restaurants or places to hangout around. 

On a Saturday night, if you try to get into any restaurant here, you will find a long waiting to get a table. While we were bar hopping in this area, we wanted to grab something quick to eat and didn&apos;t want to spend too much time in long queues to get a table, we found this place and it looked like we can get food quickly here which was true as their service was pretty fast.

While looking at the menu the manager showed us couple of good vegetarian options which we ordered including one vegetarian taco plate which had like four tacos in it and a vegetarian eggplant sandwich sandwich which was so good compared to any other place I have tried earlier. We also got their special margaritas and loved it too. Two of my friends eat chicken so they ordered chicken tacos and a chicken sandwich and they gave a very good review to me because they loved it.

Their food was full of flavor specially the sandwiches. It&apos;s very difficult to find a sandwich which has less flavor of the bread and more of the content inside. We loved it totally.

I am so glad that I found this Mexican place near my house and I would love to go there at any time now to have their tacos for dinner."
5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!
