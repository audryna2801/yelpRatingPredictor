5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"

4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."

5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on.

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"

There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers.

We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."

Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."

2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on.

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"

There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers.

We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."

Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."

2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on.

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"

There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers.

We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."

Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."

2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on.

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"

There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers.

We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."

Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."

2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on.

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"

There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers.

We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."

Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."

2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on.

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"

There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers.

We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."

Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."

2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
5,"So glad I stopped in for a nightcap after dinner. Or umm a few nightcaps lol. 

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."

Wasn&apos;t sure what kind of experience I was in for after arriving to a not obvious entrance, waited in a small line to be seated, and carefully placed at a particular spot along the bar top. I was pleasantly surprised. Both bartenders were so great! Approachable, educated, friendly and attentive, given how busy they were constantly making drinks! Small lists of snack options. I had the duck spring roll. SO delicious and perfect if you are looking for a little protein but not a large amount to eat. The atmosphere is nice; dimly lit, well chosen music, and not a pretentious vibe to be had. Cocktails I had each hit the spot. &quot;What She&apos;s Having&quot;, &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and an off the menu choice made for me by one of the bartenders, &quot;The Art of Choke.&quot; My experience at the Violet Hour was one to remember and I would absolutely visit again if I was in the area!"
2,"I was able to re-arrange my plans when Violet hour changed my reservations that i had to put a $100 deposit on-  I get it Covid. The service was awful. We couldn&apos;t get water. We couldnt get any answers about the menu. If your terrified to interact with people wearing masks you should probably come up with a different business model. 4 people ordered drinks via my phone because apparently you no longer get a waitress -  but only 2 drinks came out.....  covid aside, you should be ashamed of charging a 23% surcharge for someone dropping off drinks i order on my my phone with no human interaction or feedback. 
During covid I&apos;m awar of spending my $ local to support my community but this was an awful experience- simple awful. Please get your shit together"
5,"The Violet Hour is my favorite speakeasy in Chicago with its hipster vibe, cool murals, dim-lit ambiance, and delicious cocktails! I love how the murals change every month, always keeps me on my toes for what&apos;s next! 

The fruity Goosey Goosey Gander martini with bourbon, grapefruit, and orange blossom water Aqua de Fior was refreshing! All of my favorite ingredients that paired well together. I also enjoyed the bubbly Love That About You cocktail with vodka, grapefruit, lavender, and Cava. My hubby liked the Manhattan and Old Fashioned (they give a little extra pour!). 

The service was great and very knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great place to impress a date!"
5,"Looked for some speakeasies while in Chicago and glad we came here located in Wicker Park!

I won&apos;t ruin it for you but the inside vibe is amazing. You&apos;ll be surprised at how well they pull off the speakeasy scene. The line was long but we got in within 20 minutes.

If you&apos;re in Chicago, 100% check out Wicker Park and 100% check out The Violet Hour for the quintessential speakeasy experience!"
2,"I receive at gift , which include a Violet Hour Olde Fashion Mix and a stirer, and a shot measuring cup and a canvas bag. I was excited to use the Violet Hour mix for Olde Fashions but the cap was loose and there was no indication that they took any precautions against tampering. Not knowing if this is their SOP or I actually received a tampered bottle I tried to contact them, over 7 times! I emailed them 5 times and called them twice. No one had the decency to get back to me, which does not inspire confidence in their attention to detail. So here sits the bottle of spices to make an Olde Fashion in my fridge, which I will end up discarding because I don&apos;t know if the ingredients are safe to consume. I was hard  press to write this negative review but I have never been ignored by a seller before. I want to cut them some slack because of the pandemic, but how hard id it to answer an email?
Would never buy from them ."
4,"Lucrative speakeasy in the heart of wicker park. I came by on a Friday night and I was not surprised to find a line trailing behind a mural with a doorknob. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before finally being taken away to this secret speakeasy.

Inside, the place is dimly lit. The seats have tall backs and each table has a carafe of water. The drink menu was very extensive! I appreciated the variety of cocktails that violet hour has to offer. There is something for everyone! 

I ordered the part and parcel which tasted like a refreshing grapefruit lychee vodka drink. My friends ordered the old fashioned which had a glistening huge spherical ice cube in it. One friend ordered the golden age which was AMAZING. it tasted like a dreamsicle because of the egg yolk. I know having egg yolk in your drink seems weird.. but hear me out. It&apos;s well worth it for the creaminess that it adds to the drink. 

Overall, I&apos;d come back to get a golden age for myself and think this is a great place to grab drinks with friends"
5,"Came to the Violet Hour twice - once on a Tuesday night for a cocktail and came back on Sunday for their cocktail class. When I visited on Tuesday night of course no wait - they do not take reservations. Parking is pretty easy in the blocks around - I parked by the 7-11 lot and walked a block, also extremely easy to access by major CTA lines. Entrance is hidden under the light and the door is in the mural (which rotates every 6-8 weeks and is painted based on submissions to the Violet Hour team!). Drinks are fantastic, staff has extreme pride in what they do and extremely knowledgeable in all things cocktails. Juice is squeezed fresh every single day, ice is made by hand by the bar backs and drinks are made with craft, thought and attention. Menu changes seasonally as do their classes. Loved both times I was here and wish I lived in Chicago to take more people here."
5,"My favorite cocktail bar that we visited duribf our recent trip to Chicago. After going to Aviary and being disappointed, we were all holding our breath when entering the Violet Hour. However, it surpassed our expectations! The interior was a lot more spacious than. I had anticipated. There were a few bars we passed on our way to the back of the building towards where there are several seating areas. Everything from the entryway, to the interior, the drink menu and the snack menu were incredible. Our waiter was also really friendly and helpful. 

We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of their summer menu release and we were not disappointed by the drinks. I had two drinks, both vodka based and they were great. I wish I could remember the names of them, but since I didn&apos;t take a picture of the menu and this summer&apos;s menu photos haven&apos;t been posted yet I&apos;m SOL. All the sips I tried from my friends drinks were excellent and they even made a special drink for one of my friends after he told them he was from Guyana! We also ordered some bites for the table, the fries were deliciously thick and crispy. The duck confit spring rolls were pleasantly crispy and didn&apos;t taste like duck. Lastly, the tuna tartare was also light and delicious.

Overall, a great find and worth checking out! The cocktails are really well balanced, unique flavors and reasonably priced for a big city."
5,"We decided to make New Year&apos;s Eve more festive with to-go cocktails from The Violet Hour, and boy did it work! Besides the cocktails being excellent, TVH did an awesome job with pickup logistics. That put them over the top to a five star review in my book. 

I made the to-go order on Tock for an afternoon pickup on NYE, and when I arrived there was a pretty lengthy line outside with customers six feet apart, spacing aided by both sidewalk markers and cones. I expected to have to go inside for pickup due to the Tock instructions, but TVH clearly understood that with so many pickups for NYE this needed to be done outside to be safe and manageable. A gentleman from TVH was going down the line asking for customer names, then radioing them back to staff inside - then a staff member would run them out to the customers. There were four or five people in front of me when I arrived, but I only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. Very efficient and safe, which I greatly appreciated! 

The cocktails came in what looked like beer bottles, with bottle caps sealed on top. We ordered two 2-serving cocktails: the Rose Garden and Fingers Crossed. They were delicious and strong, at least for us infrequent drinkers! We thought the quantities were generous for 2 and surprisingly reasonable price wise. The labels on each bottle listed the components, which was helpful to consult since we found the flavors to be nicely complex. 

The Rose Garden was my favorite of the two. A vodka-based cocktail, it was both citrusy and herbal, lightened nicely by sparkling wine. It had a lovely pink color thanks to the Ramazzotti Rosato liqueur. Fingers Crossed was also very tasty, but a little heavier with rum and banana creme liqueur and different fruit juices. It was like a sophisticated tiki drink, which I mean as a compliment!

I would definitely do take out from TVH again. It would be nice to have a couple snack options for takeout as well (which I remember fondly from in person visits years ago), but I&apos;d chose their cocktails over others any day!"
5,"My husband took me here for drinks after our first date and I loved it! I love the feel of it being in wicker park in a place where you would not imagine a bar being. It is great when you want to get drinks and have a conversation with someone, it&apos;s great for a place where you want to just see each other and not other people because of the seating arrangements. I love the drinks they&apos;re awesome, I was on my way to try all of them but with Covid that became a problem. If you are looking for cool, new, flavorful drinks this is definitely the place to go!"
2,"While I&apos;m always hesitant to write a negative review because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end, I have to say my first visit went way worse than I&apos;d hoped for. 

I know that things are weird with covid regulations since I myself am industry, but if it&apos;s going to affect service then management should consider wether or not they are truly ready to re open. My fiancée had been telling me for months how much he wanted to take me here since I am new to Chicago and when he heard the news that they were reopening he immediately signed us up for a 3 drink tasting. I was super excited to check it!

Once we were seated and had been sitting for about 15 minutes we started to notice that we were not the only table that had not been greeted. The more we looked around the more unhappy guests we started to pick up on. 

Several guests were waiving down servers... and we soon got the attention of someone on staff ourselves. They explained that it usually took time for someone to come by and they were sorry that they didn&apos;t explain that, we understood. 

While I do understand.. I hate to be that person who says &quot;I&apos;m in the industry&quot; but servers typically have time to say hi or acknowledge your presence before getting to you.

Whatever, we said ok and continued to wait. At this point 30 minutes had passed- sometimes angry guests say I&apos;ve been waiting 30 minutes and the server is thinking I watched you sit down 2 minutes ago nice try... but we had actually been sitting for 30 minutes. The servers personality was the only redeeming quality and I wish I had grabbed their name- they seemed genuinely frazzled and apologetic. 

So we wait another 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive, mind you that the table time limit is 90 minutes in Chicago due to covid regulations. We are an hour into a 3 drink tasting with 30 minutes to slam our drinks.. by the time they came back to ask if we were ready for the 2nd drink we had 10 minutes left. By the time the second drink comes out we are past our time limit and we have been warned by the staff that they will only give us 30 more minutes. 

We ask the server for the 3rd drink and it comes out with 10 minutes left to spare, but it&apos;s not the drink (absinthe) that was on the tasting menu and it may have very well been the worst one I&apos;ve ever had.. so the server comes back by and we ask what we are drinking because we were under the impression that it was supposed to be absinthe and they say that no one liked it the night before so they changed it. 

This is the reason I&apos;m leaving 2 stars instead of 1- they took the bad drinks and brought us absinthe with the quickest turn around time of the night and it&apos;s the only reason that we would come back- the staff actually seemed to care. 

The drinks were underwhelming, but that&apos;s not why I&apos;m leaving the review. Again, management- come on. You were working with a fully booked reservation schedule with no time for turning tables (cleaning, re setting, etc) and you still let it happen with like 5 people staffed in the building. We watched multiple tables leave without finishing the tasting. I use &quot;they&quot; in the review because I don&apos;t want to single anyone from the staff out.. 

The new regulations suck.. its hard to make sure everything is implemented when you&apos;re busy, but they are there for a reason. Your staff was haphazardly attempting to clean tables to flip them. Protocols were being missed. Everyone needs money and they have the right to get back to work- but don&apos;t throw them to the wolves... that&apos;s what annoyed me most. Your staff was getting trampled.

We will give it another try once the pandemic has actually calmed down and things are relatively normal but I&apos;d advise others that right now they are better off making a cocktail at home."
2,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to spend Halloween here. It cost us around $180 dollars for a 3-course cocktail flight and light snacks (olives and spicy dried chickpeas).  Our expectation of this experience was high because the website description sounded fabulous. All in all, the experience we got was disappointing. 

On google, it said that they close at 10:30 pm, but the reservation options were available until 10:30 pm. To avoid getting a rushed service, we called in and asked if it&apos;s ok for us to reserve a table at 10 pm. They said it was fine and that they will not start clearing the patio until midnight.

When we arrived at 10 pm, the whole set up was very underwhelming. 
By 10:30 pm the servers had already put away the outside set-up and our table was the only one in the middle of the sidewalk. Not only that, the servers were nowhere to be found for about 20 minutes around the time we left (11:20 ish). 

We felt unwelcome and the service felt rushed. The drinks kept coming when we haven&apos;t even finished drinking the prior ones. The servers just handed us the drinks with a piece of paper that contained the history of the drink and basically, we had to do the reading. 

Only on the very last (3rd) drink delivery, the bartender himself came out to talk about the history of the cocktail. Needless to say, the third drink came out when my boyfriend and I haven&apos;t even finished drinking our second drinks yet. I was still working on my first drink. The guy was very nice and made us feel a bit more comfortable. I guess that was the kind of experience we hoped that we paid for. It&apos;s just disappointing that this was the only pleasant experience of the entire evening. 

Overall, the experience was underwhelming and rushed. I&apos;d say that it is definitely not worth the $180."
4,"The Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago&apos;s best gems! It deserves all the hype. The lines are the worst and since this is a place where people like to stay for a while, the wait does not move fast. However, in my experience, the bouncers and hostesses are very professional and do a good job of maintaining order. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll find yourself in a elegantly decorated room with a menu full of fancy-named drinks and ingredients you&apos;ve never heard of before. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything to us and we ended up with a couple rounds of drinks that we all loved. In my opinion, $14 price tag is totally worth it and the experience here is unique. By the way, the house rules aren&apos;t really enforced, obviously, everyone had their phones out.

My only gripe was that I couldn&apos;t find any place to hang up my coat so I had to hold it in my lap the whole time. I saw several others doing the same..."
4,"My husband and I sought out this speakeasy during our weekend away in Chicago. My goal was to visit as many speakeasies as we could, and as this gem popped into our radar, we decided to check it out.

The door is unassuming, but right on a Main Street, which I appreciate in a speakeasy. Part of the fun is hunting them out.

Inside, the feel is classy and swanky, dim lighting, nooks created with a high-backed chairs create an optimal environment for intimate conversations. I also greatly appreciated that the music was kept low, allowing the conversations to happen at a normal volume.

We were seated at the bar. I do wish we had been given the option to sit at a small table or a booth. While not my first choice, sitting at the bar did work out well for us. Our bartender, Ruby, was amazing! She whipped up some drinks for my husband and I -- a fruity drink for him (Baby Steps) and a rum old fashioned on special for me. They were gorgeous and delicious. We drank and talked, and then grabbed a second drink. This time, I talked with Ruby telling her what I liked. She let me say a few things -- not too sweet, I like a flash of fire, a bit fruity, smoky, adventurous. Next thing I know the absolute perfect cocktail is sitting in front of me. My husband got another fruity drink, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.

The only things I would change are making the location more of a challenge to find and giving us the option to sit at a small table instead of at the bar.

All in all we had a great time. Service and drinks were stellar. I would absolutely come here again and bring all my friends."
4,"I&apos;ve been dying to try this place for ages! Then hubby and I happened to be staying in Wicker Park on the spur of the moment. We had no plans... so I said we were going here.
We got the 15 minutes before opening. It was a cold Saturday night. We were about the 12 to 15th people in line. So we got in right away. 
We sat at the bar and had a nice friendly bartender... Although, it seems like they were all nice and friendly. 
Hubby and I ended up trying two drinks each and the bar snacks. The drinks are fantastic. Using unusual ingredients and they all work together. The bar snacks are a perfect combo of spicy, sweet, salty, and a bit of fat (the rinds were so light and melt in your mouth good!)

The only downside of all this phenomenal atmosphere, service, and quality is that they have no olives. It&apos;s something about the fact that olives were not a cocktail thing in the prohibition era. So to be true to the era, the owners don&apos;t serve them. 
Hmmm... well, this is 100 years later. I would have loved to try a dirty martini from such competent bartenders.  Oh well, I&apos;d still go back."
4,"Updating my review - I was able to sit inside in their truly beautiful and romantic space on probably the last day they were allowed to be open :-( All of the cocktails were excellent, their cocktail list is huge, and the ambiance is perfect. You can order via your phone which is great during covid. Would come back, I hope they make it through this!"
5,"Every time my boyfriend is in town, it is our fave place to go and have a few drinks. I love this speakeasy! They play awesome music and the ambience is incredible. All the servers that I&apos;ve had are always so nice and knowledgable. Drinks are a bit pricey but they do the job so it&apos;s definitely worth it."
4,"I really loved it here! Great cocktail bar with good service. At the moment, it&apos;s 100% contactless ordering through Tock (used to make my reservation), so the only time we interacted with the staff was upon checkin and when drinks were dropped at our table. The drinks were very good but I do feel that the flavors could&apos;ve been a little more dimensional. Otherwise, the place has a great ambiance and nice music! It was realllly cold last night though because the door was open and we were seated closest to it. This makes sense but after sitting for a while, the temperature became a little unpleasant. Overall, I&apos;d go back!"
2,"My birthday is 9/11, so my expectations are usually very low for celebrations. Just left the Violet Hour and I&apos;m disappointed in the general experience. This is probably my 10th time here, first time during this crazy COVID era. 

Firstly, the service is fine (same as always-- they make complicated drinks and it takes a moment, but they get there in time and servers are good at anticipating needs). Secondly, the outdoor seating is cute, well-spaced, etc. 

Please be aware that there is a 90 min limit for a table and a 25$ per person deposit when booking-- I was, and was happy to prepay in order to ensure a spot; in regular times, it can be a long wait for a table! After 2 rounds of drinks in 90 mins, an unfamiliar server or maybe manager dropped our check, which again was expected. We had just ordered a third round before it was dropped, and when we told her that, she said it would be on the check when we paid via mobile (it was). We got our drinks 10 min after that, and our next staff interaction was after we&apos;d finished those up 30 min later when the same woman told us &quot;it&apos;s like, literally illegal to have you sitting here for more than two hours so you do need to leave.&quot; 

We were *literally* minutes from leaving, so we obviously did. Two important notes: 1) we were one of two occupied tables at 7 PM on a Friday, so there was no one waiting; 2) *literally* one of the ruder interactions I&apos;ve had since March. My friend went to use the bathroom as I left and she also apologized for inadvertently staying too long to the woman who&apos;d spoken to us but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge her. I guess maybe we shouldn&apos;t have ordered that last round of drinks but...we did, and we wouldn&apos;t have if we knew it would be an issue.

It&apos;s fine. We&apos;re all doing our best and I know Chicago COVID regulations are strict. But for $180 for three rounds of drinks, there are plenty of other options in the city right now where your patronage is likely to be more appreciated. I kind of regret choosing to come for whatever a &quot;special occasion&quot; is in 2020. Caveat emptor."
5,"I love the cocktails here and they are worth every penny of that $14 price tag. I&apos;ve never ordered food though because I usually come before eating at Big Star. My favorite cocktail is called the Juliet &amp; Romeo, and my husband likes the Blue Ridge Manhattan. I&apos;m sure I would come here all the time if I lived in the Wicker Park area. 

Tip: get here early on weekends if you want to avoid a very long wait."
