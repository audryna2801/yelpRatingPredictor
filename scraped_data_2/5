5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."

5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."

They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz.

My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.

The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."

If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order.

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque.

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.

Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"

Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.

The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork

3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."

I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."

They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz.

My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.

The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."

If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order.

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque.

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.

Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"

Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.

The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork

3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."

I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."

They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz.

My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.

The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."

If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order.

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque.

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.

Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"

Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.

The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork

3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."

I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."

They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz.

My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.

The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it&apos;s always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw.

BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.

Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I&apos;d give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband&apos;s full slab was fine.

Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage.

Sauce - 3 - It was a little too &quot;Carolina&quot; (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I&apos;m not sure if they have other kinds, but I&apos;ll add that as a request the next time we order meats.

Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  

Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they&apos;d follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they&apos;ve done that by now.

Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we&apos;re all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
4,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can&apos;t believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I&apos;m a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem&apos;s. Although I&apos;m partial to Lem&apos;s and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ.

Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It&apos;s incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn&apos;t overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.

They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they&apos;re meatier. 

Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn&apos;t for you. Otherwise I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth a special trip if you&apos;re on the Northside."
5,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
4,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork
5,"Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! 

All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 

Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
5,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides.

I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!

Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
5,"Prior to the Governor&apos;s shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I&apos;d have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don&apos;t carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it&apos;s a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
4,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they&apos;re open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It&apos;s pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
3,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. 

I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I&apos;m originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. 

Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  

The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. 
Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I&apos;m from kansas city and used to KC BBQ.

Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for &apos;our-GO-TO&apos; bbq place here in Chicago."
5,"I haven&apos;t been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. 

Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. 

BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don&apos;t do it often, but I&apos;m going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
4,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that&apos;s good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn&apos;t the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I&apos;d go again."
5,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!

My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!

Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won&apos;t want to)!

Can&apos;t wait to order it again!"
5,"I am a huge fan of this place and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still going during the pandemic. 

I&apos;ve been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it&apos;s a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned.

The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don&apos;t remember getting a single bad thing there."
5,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
5,"Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don&apos;t accept cash, only card at the window. 

I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac &amp; cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. 
First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn&apos;t need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I&apos;m usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque&apos;s is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don&apos;t use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac &amp; cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. 
They do make sure that your food doesn&apos;t spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 

Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can&apos;t wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
1,"So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. 
The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I don&apos;t mine paying for &quot;good food!&quot; Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. 
I really expected more."
5,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I&apos;d highly recommend the brisket!

We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I&apos;d definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn&apos;t as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. 

For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can&apos;t go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn&apos;t tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I&apos;d choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
5,"After reading raving reviews I had high expectations and this place didn&apos;t disappoint. A truly great BBQ joint. Not only BBQ, but everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked. Sliced and chipped brisket, baby back ribs, Mac&apos;N&apos;Cheese, cornbread, fries and slaw. Literally everything was so good! Meat was tender, just melts in your mouth, sides were fresh, everything perfectly cooked and combined. Simply the best lunch in a long while and definitely the best bbq I&apos;ve ever try. And forgot to mention their fantastic sauces. My fav was no doubt the Memphis style sauce. But seems like you can&apos;t go wrong with anything here. And the service was great too! It was so nice to have heaters to enjoy this delicious food with comfort.
If you think you&apos;ve tried the best bbq - try this, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
Will definitely be back!"
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!

The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce.

The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!

One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They&apos;re candied pickled jalapeños! There&apos;s a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket.

Cannot wait to try the ribs next!"
5,"Meats-
Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)
Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)
Mac n Cheese: 5
Cornbread: 3 
Baked beans: 4
Fries: 4

Service: 5 
They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  

We&apos;ll venture back..."
4,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try.

Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top.

Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I&apos;ll mention more about that below.

BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.
