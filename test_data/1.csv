5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"
5,"&quot;Live your life without ever having to ask, &apos;What if?&quot;
~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management.

We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."

5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is.

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"
5,"&quot;Live your life without ever having to ask, &apos;What if?&quot;
~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"
5,"&quot;Live your life without ever having to ask, &apos;What if?&quot;
~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way.

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."

Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them.

I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"
5,"&quot;Live your life without ever having to ask, &apos;What if?&quot;
~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."

5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."

In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it.

Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet.

I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner. 

We had reservations to celebrate my birthday, and the entire front of the house staff were completely accommodating and welcoming. The service was impeccable, as our server was extremely knowledgeable of the menu and offered his pro tips in recommendations.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
