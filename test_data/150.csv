5,"Come on admit it...every once in a while you wake up and are like &quot;what&apos;s missing in my life? It must be turkish coffee and baklava&quot;
I was overjoyed that this was not one of restaurants closed during the pandemic . Everyone who goes there is properly spaced. The room is devided by boxes.

If your mom was Turkish she would force you to eat everything you ordered in one sitting. But since that&apos;s not the case unless it is you can eat leftovers for another time.

My friend had the baklava and I had turkish coffee. Apparently you have to tell them if you want it extra hot, strong, more sugary or just a little sugary. I wanted mine just a,little sugary...

They give you this carrot salad that has I think mayonnaise and bread while you wait.

The people next to me come all the time and order Turkish pizza with coffee every few days. It looks razor thin and and has beef in it with no cheese. Something to come back and try.

I had some beef skewers as appetizers with what I thought was a side of taboule...that&apos;s not just a,side ...that&apos;s a portion for paul bunyan...yowza.

I chose the veggie options on the side very carefully because me and spicy dont get along. The baklava is the best in chicago or is on par with the best I&apos;ve ever had. Ironically I came here to prepare for a trip to Turkey in a few months...I think I&apos;m gonna have to prepare more. Awesome food spot that has indoor dining. Yes I put back the mask when they come over and ask us if we want more."
5,"Zizi&apos;s is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Chicago. I order from here 1-3 times a week depending on my schedule. The food is always fresh (even via delivery, and I live in Logan Square these days!), the people are incredibly friendly, and the prices are very reasonable especially considering the serving sizes and quality. Speaking of the serving sizes, most of the platters (chicken doner is my go-to) can easily make 2-3 hearty meals, and keep very well. The salads are also huge, and delicious. I am partial towards the kale and the Turkish feta, but they&apos;re all good. Add meat if that&apos;s your thing. 

Oh, and the bread. Get the bread. It is fresh, usually still warm, and amazing. Their desserts are solid too, especially if you&apos;re a rice pudding fan. Now that I type this, I&apos;m wondering why I didn&apos;t order rice pudding tonight....

Anyways, you can&apos;t go wrong here. Look at the menu, find something that sounds good to you in the moment,  go with it, and thank me later."
5,"Ordered the chicken doner kebab plate for takeout and a side of dolmas.
Every bit of it was delicious and one plate lasts me three meals! The chicken was perfect but best part is the buttery rice it comes with. I could eat this forever."
5,"Killer place: great food, large portion, nice staff, good price. They often throw in a little something too. I&apos;ve had a few gyro places in Chicago, even highly rated ones, and my disappointment was unresolved until going to Zizi&apos;s. 

The beef gyro sandwich, wrap, and fries are amazing. The former is so big that even my constantly overconsuming American ass can&apos;t finish it in one sitting."
5,"Let me start this by saying that I have been eating Mediterranean food since I was a little baby. This is THE BEST I have EVER had. I&apos;m a lentil soup SNOB and this red lentil is not only the best lentil soup I&apos;ve ever had, but the best SOUP I&apos;ve ever had. I can tell that this is a family business that takes great pride in their business and it shows in their food. 10/10, A+, literally amazing amazing food. The dolma is amazing, the chicken platter is amazing (my boyfriend LOVES it). Just amazing job. Thank you!! Will be addicted to this soup for years now."
5,"Excellent place. Ate here sitting out due to the &apos;rona times. 
Menu is simple and easy to get through. 
Had the chicken kabab and the Turkish flat bread with toppings called lahmacun. 
Excellent and flavorful. Also had a salad. 
3 dishes came to approx 40 USD 
Very much a mom (polish) + pop (Turkish) and kids store. 
The free bread was excellent and so was the carrot dip. 
Great value for money 
Would return and I strongly recommend!"
4,"Overall: Arguably the best Turkish food in the area, with great prices to go with it.

The good: We started off with the lahmacun, which was thin, crisp, and flavorful. I&apos;d never had one before and, paired with the amazing and complimentary bread, was a great start to the meal. The bread was warm and soft, I had to contain myself to not eat more. The service was friendly, they have outdoor seating (though the inside&apos;s atmosphere is a nice touch), anad it&apos;s BYOB. Oh, and the prices are right.

The not-so-good: The Adana (lamb) wrap was great but didn&apos;t blow me away, nor did the fries. They were still great, but nothing out of this world.

Food: 8.5/10
Atmosphere: 8.5/10
Service: 8.5/10"
5,"We ordered doner kebab (gyros) platters. Everything tasted so good. We will be coming back here, again and again."
5,"Couldn&apos;t love this place more. Fresh, delicious food, friendly service and a great little outdoor patio. An awesome family run Chicago business!"
5,"Absolutely delicious! We got a chicken wrap, doner sandwich and feta platter, all amazing!! The homemade bread was to die for as well. Great food!"
5,"Zizi&apos;s is such a delight. They have an amazing menu and a cozy atmosphere that makes you feel at home. But if that doesn&apos;t pull you in immediately, the complimentary crispy bread and carrot spread will. 

The first time I came here, my friend and I shared the falafel wrap (which comes with really great fries) and arugula caprese salad. The falafel is wonderful and its texture is on the creamier side. I wasn&apos;t expecting to love the arugula salad as much as I did, because it seemed fairly simple, but they managed to make it taste exceptionally good. I had never tried ratatouille before coming to Zizi&apos;s, but I was intrigued by the Pide with Eggplant Ratatouille so I ordered it the next time I visited -- it was delicious and light, wrapped in thin dough and served pre-sliced so it was easy to share. Zizi&apos;s is BYOB, and needless to say, everything pairs wonderfully with a bottle of wine.

The service is always great and I feel happy just thinking about the food here. Can&apos;t recommend it enough!"
5,"Amazing authentic Turkish halal restaurant. I loved the pies. They have great variety of options.
I would love to come back again"
5,"I love this place. It&apos;s easy, delicious and the price is always good. We&apos;ve only eaten in once a few years ago but otherwise it&apos;s all take out. And everything stays fresh. I highly recommend the platter with all of the dips. It&apos;s seriously it&apos;s own meal!"
4,"Zizi&apos;s is a nice little spot for Turkish cuisine. The owner is very friendly and attentive. They have good selection of different dishes. Sultan platter looked great, however they didn&apos;t ask how well we wanted our meat and it ended up being a little dry."
5,"My boyfriend ordered us food from here. It was so delicious, I ordered it again for myself the very next day. We got the lamb doner, and the chicken schwarma. The roasted veggies that came with these plates were so tasty, and different. Usually when you order Mediterranean, you get a protein, rice, and pita. I LOVE how they include the roasted veggies, it makes my meal feel more well rounded. And the homemade pita bread!!! SO good. This place is definitely on my greatest hits list in the city."
5,"This is going to be my new favorite, after-work snack pick-up spot. I ordered the cheese pide, just because I wanted something small and chill. I got a solid meal and evening snack out of my one order! It was so tasty and something new for me. I look forward to trying other items off of their menu. I ordered takeout because, again pandemic living, and it was easy, smooth, and early. Can&apos;t wait to try more and support local businesses during this wild time!"
5,"This place is open and delivering, they are family owned and their dishes are great ... The trifecta of food!  Their moussaka keeps me coming back. 
Don&apos;t cook dinner tonight, call them directly and order in!!"
4,"One of my favorite places for iskandar kabob. The tomato sauce that they pour over the lamb doner is super tasty. I&apos;m writing this review specially after ordering take out and it was just as good! The quality of the food was the same and the portion size was massive! My two year old really enjoyed the sujuk pide, it was pure cheesy goodness."
5,"I&apos;ve dined in and gotten takeout or delivery from Zizi&apos;s countless times and never had a bad experience. Food and service is consistently solid. Pretty interior with mosaic lamps makes this a fun restaurant to bring guests.

Menu must-haves include their carrot spread (free for dine-in), doner sandwiches, and lamacun or pizmahagun wrap. The true standout is their homemade bread, which comes on their sandwiches and alongside starters. Not quite like a traditional pita, as it&apos;s fluffier and pocketless, but entirely superior. Be sure to order extra to take home!"
5,"Delicious, fresh, and affordable Mediterranean food!  Ordered take out through Grubhub on a Saturday night. The order was ready within 30-40 minutes of ordering. We shared the falafel and the hummus with bread. The falafel was so flavorful and had a fantastic texture that was a little crispy on the outside but very soft and moist on the inside. It came with a nice tahini sauce for dipping. The hummus was very smooth and creamy and the fresh bread was amazing! It had a great texture and was hearty. It complimented the hummus perfectly. I had the chicken kebab entree which was fantastic. The chicken was tender and flavorful as was the wheat couscous that came with the meal.  Loved the variety of roasted veggies as well. It was a large portion and made great leftovers. He had the wrap with ground beef and chicken and said that eat bite got better and better. Also came with fries. We will definitely be back to try more!"

The food is always fresh (even via delivery, and I live in Logan Square these days!), the people are incredibly friendly, and the prices are very reasonable especially considering the serving sizes and quality. Speaking of the serving sizes, most of the platters (chicken doner is my go-to) can easily make 2-3 hearty meals, and keep very well. The salads are also huge, and delicious. I am partial towards the kale and the Turkish feta, but they&apos;re all good. Add meat if that&apos;s your thing. 

Oh, and the bread. Get the bread. It is fresh, usually still warm, and amazing. Their desserts are solid too, especially if you&apos;re a rice pudding fan. Now that I type this, I&apos;m wondering why I didn&apos;t order rice pudding tonight....

Anyways, you can&apos;t go wrong here. Look at the menu, find something that sounds good to you in the moment,  go with it, and thank me later."
5,"Ordered the chicken doner kebab plate for takeout and a side of dolmas.
Every bit of it was delicious and one plate lasts me three meals! The chicken was perfect but best part is the buttery rice it comes with. I could eat this forever."
5,"Killer place: great food, large portion, nice staff, good price. They often throw in a little something too. I&apos;ve had a few gyro places in Chicago, even highly rated ones, and my disappointment was unresolved until going to Zizi&apos;s. 

The beef gyro sandwich, wrap, and fries are amazing. The former is so big that even my constantly overconsuming American ass can&apos;t finish it in one sitting."
5,"Let me start this by saying that I have been eating Mediterranean food since I was a little baby. This is THE BEST I have EVER had. I&apos;m a lentil soup SNOB and this red lentil is not only the best lentil soup I&apos;ve ever had, but the best SOUP I&apos;ve ever had. I can tell that this is a family business that takes great pride in their business and it shows in their food. 10/10, A+, literally amazing amazing food. The dolma is amazing, the chicken platter is amazing (my boyfriend LOVES it). Just amazing job. Thank you!! Will be addicted to this soup for years now."
5,"Excellent place. Ate here sitting out due to the &apos;rona times. 
Menu is simple and easy to get through. 
Had the chicken kabab and the Turkish flat bread with toppings called lahmacun. 
Excellent and flavorful. Also had a salad. 
3 dishes came to approx 40 USD 
Very much a mom (polish) + pop (Turkish) and kids store. 
The free bread was excellent and so was the carrot dip. 
Great value for money 
Would return and I strongly recommend!"
4,"Overall: Arguably the best Turkish food in the area, with great prices to go with it.

The good: We started off with the lahmacun, which was thin, crisp, and flavorful. I&apos;d never had one before and, paired with the amazing and complimentary bread, was a great start to the meal. The bread was warm and soft, I had to contain myself to not eat more. The service was friendly, they have outdoor seating (though the inside&apos;s atmosphere is a nice touch), anad it&apos;s BYOB. Oh, and the prices are right.

The not-so-good: The Adana (lamb) wrap was great but didn&apos;t blow me away, nor did the fries. They were still great, but nothing out of this world.

Food: 8.5/10
Atmosphere: 8.5/10
Service: 8.5/10"
5,"We ordered doner kebab (gyros) platters. Everything tasted so good. We will be coming back here, again and again."
5,"Couldn&apos;t love this place more. Fresh, delicious food, friendly service and a great little outdoor patio. An awesome family run Chicago business!"
5,"Absolutely delicious! We got a chicken wrap, doner sandwich and feta platter, all amazing!! The homemade bread was to die for as well. Great food!"
5,"Zizi&apos;s is such a delight. They have an amazing menu and a cozy atmosphere that makes you feel at home. But if that doesn&apos;t pull you in immediately, the complimentary crispy bread and carrot spread will. 

The first time I came here, my friend and I shared the falafel wrap (which comes with really great fries) and arugula caprese salad. The falafel is wonderful and its texture is on the creamier side. I wasn&apos;t expecting to love the arugula salad as much as I did, because it seemed fairly simple, but they managed to make it taste exceptionally good. I had never tried ratatouille before coming to Zizi&apos;s, but I was intrigued by the Pide with Eggplant Ratatouille so I ordered it the next time I visited -- it was delicious and light, wrapped in thin dough and served pre-sliced so it was easy to share. Zizi&apos;s is BYOB, and needless to say, everything pairs wonderfully with a bottle of wine.

The service is always great and I feel happy just thinking about the food here. Can&apos;t recommend it enough!"
5,"Amazing authentic Turkish halal restaurant. I loved the pies. They have great variety of options.
I would love to come back again"
5,"I love this place. It&apos;s easy, delicious and the price is always good. We&apos;ve only eaten in once a few years ago but otherwise it&apos;s all take out. And everything stays fresh. I highly recommend the platter with all of the dips. It&apos;s seriously it&apos;s own meal!"
4,"Zizi&apos;s is a nice little spot for Turkish cuisine. The owner is very friendly and attentive. They have good selection of different dishes. Sultan platter looked great, however they didn&apos;t ask how well we wanted our meat and it ended up being a little dry."
5,"My boyfriend ordered us food from here. It was so delicious, I ordered it again for myself the very next day. We got the lamb doner, and the chicken schwarma. The roasted veggies that came with these plates were so tasty, and different. Usually when you order Mediterranean, you get a protein, rice, and pita. I LOVE how they include the roasted veggies, it makes my meal feel more well rounded. And the homemade pita bread!!! SO good. This place is definitely on my greatest hits list in the city."
5,"This is going to be my new favorite, after-work snack pick-up spot. I ordered the cheese pide, just because I wanted something small and chill. I got a solid meal and evening snack out of my one order! It was so tasty and something new for me. I look forward to trying other items off of their menu. I ordered takeout because, again pandemic living, and it was easy, smooth, and early. Can&apos;t wait to try more and support local businesses during this wild time!"
5,"This place is open and delivering, they are family owned and their dishes are great ... The trifecta of food!  Their moussaka keeps me coming back. 
Don&apos;t cook dinner tonight, call them directly and order in!!"
4,"One of my favorite places for iskandar kabob. The tomato sauce that they pour over the lamb doner is super tasty. I&apos;m writing this review specially after ordering take out and it was just as good! The quality of the food was the same and the portion size was massive! My two year old really enjoyed the sujuk pide, it was pure cheesy goodness."
5,"I&apos;ve dined in and gotten takeout or delivery from Zizi&apos;s countless times and never had a bad experience. Food and service is consistently solid. Pretty interior with mosaic lamps makes this a fun restaurant to bring guests.

Menu must-haves include their carrot spread (free for dine-in), doner sandwiches, and lamacun or pizmahagun wrap. The true standout is their homemade bread, which comes on their sandwiches and alongside starters. Not quite like a traditional pita, as it&apos;s fluffier and pocketless, but entirely superior. Be sure to order extra to take home!"
5,"Delicious, fresh, and affordable Mediterranean food!  Ordered take out through Grubhub on a Saturday night. The order was ready within 30-40 minutes of ordering. We shared the falafel and the hummus with bread. The falafel was so flavorful and had a fantastic texture that was a little crispy on the outside but very soft and moist on the inside. It came with a nice tahini sauce for dipping. The hummus was very smooth and creamy and the fresh bread was amazing! It had a great texture and was hearty. It complimented the hummus perfectly. I had the chicken kebab entree which was fantastic. The chicken was tender and flavorful as was the wheat couscous that came with the meal.  Loved the variety of roasted veggies as well. It was a large portion and made great leftovers. He had the wrap with ground beef and chicken and said that eat bite got better and better. Also came with fries. We will definitely be back to try more!"
5,"Come on admit it...every once in a while you wake up and are like &quot;what&apos;s missing in my life? It must be turkish coffee and baklava&quot;
I was overjoyed that this was not one of restaurants closed during the pandemic . Everyone who goes there is properly spaced. The room is devided by boxes.

If your mom was Turkish she would force you to eat everything you ordered in one sitting. But since that&apos;s not the case unless it is you can eat leftovers for another time.

My friend had the baklava and I had turkish coffee. Apparently you have to tell them if you want it extra hot, strong, more sugary or just a little sugary. I wanted mine just a,little sugary...

They give you this carrot salad that has I think mayonnaise and bread while you wait.

The people next to me come all the time and order Turkish pizza with coffee every few days. It looks razor thin and and has beef in it with no cheese. Something to come back and try.

I had some beef skewers as appetizers with what I thought was a side of taboule...that&apos;s not just a,side ...that&apos;s a portion for paul bunyan...yowza.

I chose the veggie options on the side very carefully because me and spicy dont get along. The baklava is the best in chicago or is on par with the best I&apos;ve ever had. Ironically I came here to prepare for a trip to Turkey in a few months...I think I&apos;m gonna have to prepare more. Awesome food spot that has indoor dining. Yes I put back the mask when they come over and ask us if we want more."

5,"Let me start this by saying that I have been eating Mediterranean food since I was a little baby. This is THE BEST I have EVER had. I&apos;m a lentil soup SNOB and this red lentil is not only the best lentil soup I&apos;ve ever had, but the best SOUP I&apos;ve ever had. I can tell that this is a family business that takes great pride in their business and it shows in their food. 10/10, A+, literally amazing amazing food. The dolma is amazing, the chicken platter is amazing (my boyfriend LOVES it). Just amazing job. Thank you!! Will be addicted to this soup for years now."
5,"Excellent place. Ate here sitting out due to the &apos;rona times. 
Menu is simple and easy to get through. 
Had the chicken kabab and the Turkish flat bread with toppings called lahmacun. 
Excellent and flavorful. Also had a salad. 
3 dishes came to approx 40 USD 
Very much a mom (polish) + pop (Turkish) and kids store. 
The free bread was excellent and so was the carrot dip. 
Great value for money 
Would return and I strongly recommend!"
4,"Overall: Arguably the best Turkish food in the area, with great prices to go with it.

The good: We started off with the lahmacun, which was thin, crisp, and flavorful. I&apos;d never had one before and, paired with the amazing and complimentary bread, was a great start to the meal. The bread was warm and soft, I had to contain myself to not eat more. The service was friendly, they have outdoor seating (though the inside&apos;s atmosphere is a nice touch), anad it&apos;s BYOB. Oh, and the prices are right.

The not-so-good: The Adana (lamb) wrap was great but didn&apos;t blow me away, nor did the fries. They were still great, but nothing out of this world.

Food: 8.5/10
Atmosphere: 8.5/10
Service: 8.5/10"
5,"We ordered doner kebab (gyros) platters. Everything tasted so good. We will be coming back here, again and again."
5,"Couldn&apos;t love this place more. Fresh, delicious food, friendly service and a great little outdoor patio. An awesome family run Chicago business!"
5,"Absolutely delicious! We got a chicken wrap, doner sandwich and feta platter, all amazing!! The homemade bread was to die for as well. Great food!"
5,"Zizi&apos;s is such a delight. They have an amazing menu and a cozy atmosphere that makes you feel at home. But if that doesn&apos;t pull you in immediately, the complimentary crispy bread and carrot spread will. 

The first time I came here, my friend and I shared the falafel wrap (which comes with really great fries) and arugula caprese salad. The falafel is wonderful and its texture is on the creamier side. I wasn&apos;t expecting to love the arugula salad as much as I did, because it seemed fairly simple, but they managed to make it taste exceptionally good. I had never tried ratatouille before coming to Zizi&apos;s, but I was intrigued by the Pide with Eggplant Ratatouille so I ordered it the next time I visited -- it was delicious and light, wrapped in thin dough and served pre-sliced so it was easy to share. Zizi&apos;s is BYOB, and needless to say, everything pairs wonderfully with a bottle of wine.

The service is always great and I feel happy just thinking about the food here. Can&apos;t recommend it enough!"
5,"Amazing authentic Turkish halal restaurant. I loved the pies. They have great variety of options.
I would love to come back again"
5,"I love this place. It&apos;s easy, delicious and the price is always good. We&apos;ve only eaten in once a few years ago but otherwise it&apos;s all take out. And everything stays fresh. I highly recommend the platter with all of the dips. It&apos;s seriously it&apos;s own meal!"
4,"Zizi&apos;s is a nice little spot for Turkish cuisine. The owner is very friendly and attentive. They have good selection of different dishes. Sultan platter looked great, however they didn&apos;t ask how well we wanted our meat and it ended up being a little dry."
5,"My boyfriend ordered us food from here. It was so delicious, I ordered it again for myself the very next day. We got the lamb doner, and the chicken schwarma. The roasted veggies that came with these plates were so tasty, and different. Usually when you order Mediterranean, you get a protein, rice, and pita. I LOVE how they include the roasted veggies, it makes my meal feel more well rounded. And the homemade pita bread!!! SO good. This place is definitely on my greatest hits list in the city."
5,"This is going to be my new favorite, after-work snack pick-up spot. I ordered the cheese pide, just because I wanted something small and chill. I got a solid meal and evening snack out of my one order! It was so tasty and something new for me. I look forward to trying other items off of their menu. I ordered takeout because, again pandemic living, and it was easy, smooth, and early. Can&apos;t wait to try more and support local businesses during this wild time!"
5,"This place is open and delivering, they are family owned and their dishes are great ... The trifecta of food!  Their moussaka keeps me coming back. 
Don&apos;t cook dinner tonight, call them directly and order in!!"
4,"One of my favorite places for iskandar kabob. The tomato sauce that they pour over the lamb doner is super tasty. I&apos;m writing this review specially after ordering take out and it was just as good! The quality of the food was the same and the portion size was massive! My two year old really enjoyed the sujuk pide, it was pure cheesy goodness."
5,"I&apos;ve dined in and gotten takeout or delivery from Zizi&apos;s countless times and never had a bad experience. Food and service is consistently solid. Pretty interior with mosaic lamps makes this a fun restaurant to bring guests.

Menu must-haves include their carrot spread (free for dine-in), doner sandwiches, and lamacun or pizmahagun wrap. The true standout is their homemade bread, which comes on their sandwiches and alongside starters. Not quite like a traditional pita, as it&apos;s fluffier and pocketless, but entirely superior. Be sure to order extra to take home!"
5,"Delicious, fresh, and affordable Mediterranean food!  Ordered take out through Grubhub on a Saturday night. The order was ready within 30-40 minutes of ordering. We shared the falafel and the hummus with bread. The falafel was so flavorful and had a fantastic texture that was a little crispy on the outside but very soft and moist on the inside. It came with a nice tahini sauce for dipping. The hummus was very smooth and creamy and the fresh bread was amazing! It had a great texture and was hearty. It complimented the hummus perfectly. I had the chicken kebab entree which was fantastic. The chicken was tender and flavorful as was the wheat couscous that came with the meal.  Loved the variety of roasted veggies as well. It was a large portion and made great leftovers. He had the wrap with ground beef and chicken and said that eat bite got better and better. Also came with fries. We will definitely be back to try more!"
5,"Come on admit it...every once in a while you wake up and are like &quot;what&apos;s missing in my life? It must be turkish coffee and baklava&quot;
I was overjoyed that this was not one of restaurants closed during the pandemic . Everyone who goes there is properly spaced. The room is devided by boxes.

If your mom was Turkish she would force you to eat everything you ordered in one sitting. But since that&apos;s not the case unless it is you can eat leftovers for another time.

My friend had the baklava and I had turkish coffee. Apparently you have to tell them if you want it extra hot, strong, more sugary or just a little sugary. I wanted mine just a,little sugary...

They give you this carrot salad that has I think mayonnaise and bread while you wait.

The people next to me come all the time and order Turkish pizza with coffee every few days. It looks razor thin and and has beef in it with no cheese. Something to come back and try.

I had some beef skewers as appetizers with what I thought was a side of taboule...that&apos;s not just a,side ...that&apos;s a portion for paul bunyan...yowza.

I chose the veggie options on the side very carefully because me and spicy dont get along. The baklava is the best in chicago or is on par with the best I&apos;ve ever had. Ironically I came here to prepare for a trip to Turkey in a few months...I think I&apos;m gonna have to prepare more. Awesome food spot that has indoor dining. Yes I put back the mask when they come over and ask us if we want more."
5,"Zizi&apos;s is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Chicago. I order from here 1-3 times a week depending on my schedule. The food is always fresh (even via delivery, and I live in Logan Square these days!), the people are incredibly friendly, and the prices are very reasonable especially considering the serving sizes and quality. Speaking of the serving sizes, most of the platters (chicken doner is my go-to) can easily make 2-3 hearty meals, and keep very well. The salads are also huge, and delicious. I am partial towards the kale and the Turkish feta, but they&apos;re all good. Add meat if that&apos;s your thing. 

Oh, and the bread. Get the bread. It is fresh, usually still warm, and amazing. Their desserts are solid too, especially if you&apos;re a rice pudding fan. Now that I type this, I&apos;m wondering why I didn&apos;t order rice pudding tonight....

Anyways, you can&apos;t go wrong here. Look at the menu, find something that sounds good to you in the moment,  go with it, and thank me later."
5,"Ordered the chicken doner kebab plate for takeout and a side of dolmas.
Every bit of it was delicious and one plate lasts me three meals! The chicken was perfect but best part is the buttery rice it comes with. I could eat this forever."

The good: We started off with the lahmacun, which was thin, crisp, and flavorful. I&apos;d never had one before and, paired with the amazing and complimentary bread, was a great start to the meal. The bread was warm and soft, I had to contain myself to not eat more. The service was friendly, they have outdoor seating (though the inside&apos;s atmosphere is a nice touch), anad it&apos;s BYOB. Oh, and the prices are right.

The not-so-good: The Adana (lamb) wrap was great but didn&apos;t blow me away, nor did the fries. They were still great, but nothing out of this world.

Food: 8.5/10
Atmosphere: 8.5/10
Service: 8.5/10"
5,"We ordered doner kebab (gyros) platters. Everything tasted so good. We will be coming back here, again and again."
5,"Couldn&apos;t love this place more. Fresh, delicious food, friendly service and a great little outdoor patio. An awesome family run Chicago business!"
5,"Absolutely delicious! We got a chicken wrap, doner sandwich and feta platter, all amazing!! The homemade bread was to die for as well. Great food!"
5,"Zizi&apos;s is such a delight. They have an amazing menu and a cozy atmosphere that makes you feel at home. But if that doesn&apos;t pull you in immediately, the complimentary crispy bread and carrot spread will. 

The first time I came here, my friend and I shared the falafel wrap (which comes with really great fries) and arugula caprese salad. The falafel is wonderful and its texture is on the creamier side. I wasn&apos;t expecting to love the arugula salad as much as I did, because it seemed fairly simple, but they managed to make it taste exceptionally good. I had never tried ratatouille before coming to Zizi&apos;s, but I was intrigued by the Pide with Eggplant Ratatouille so I ordered it the next time I visited -- it was delicious and light, wrapped in thin dough and served pre-sliced so it was easy to share. Zizi&apos;s is BYOB, and needless to say, everything pairs wonderfully with a bottle of wine.

The service is always great and I feel happy just thinking about the food here. Can&apos;t recommend it enough!"
5,"Amazing authentic Turkish halal restaurant. I loved the pies. They have great variety of options.
I would love to come back again"
5,"I love this place. It&apos;s easy, delicious and the price is always good. We&apos;ve only eaten in once a few years ago but otherwise it&apos;s all take out. And everything stays fresh. I highly recommend the platter with all of the dips. It&apos;s seriously it&apos;s own meal!"
4,"Zizi&apos;s is a nice little spot for Turkish cuisine. The owner is very friendly and attentive. They have good selection of different dishes. Sultan platter looked great, however they didn&apos;t ask how well we wanted our meat and it ended up being a little dry."
5,"My boyfriend ordered us food from here. It was so delicious, I ordered it again for myself the very next day. We got the lamb doner, and the chicken schwarma. The roasted veggies that came with these plates were so tasty, and different. Usually when you order Mediterranean, you get a protein, rice, and pita. I LOVE how they include the roasted veggies, it makes my meal feel more well rounded. And the homemade pita bread!!! SO good. This place is definitely on my greatest hits list in the city."
5,"This is going to be my new favorite, after-work snack pick-up spot. I ordered the cheese pide, just because I wanted something small and chill. I got a solid meal and evening snack out of my one order! It was so tasty and something new for me. I look forward to trying other items off of their menu. I ordered takeout because, again pandemic living, and it was easy, smooth, and early. Can&apos;t wait to try more and support local businesses during this wild time!"
5,"This place is open and delivering, they are family owned and their dishes are great ... The trifecta of food!  Their moussaka keeps me coming back. 
Don&apos;t cook dinner tonight, call them directly and order in!!"
4,"One of my favorite places for iskandar kabob. The tomato sauce that they pour over the lamb doner is super tasty. I&apos;m writing this review specially after ordering take out and it was just as good! The quality of the food was the same and the portion size was massive! My two year old really enjoyed the sujuk pide, it was pure cheesy goodness."
5,"I&apos;ve dined in and gotten takeout or delivery from Zizi&apos;s countless times and never had a bad experience. Food and service is consistently solid. Pretty interior with mosaic lamps makes this a fun restaurant to bring guests.

Menu must-haves include their carrot spread (free for dine-in), doner sandwiches, and lamacun or pizmahagun wrap. The true standout is their homemade bread, which comes on their sandwiches and alongside starters. Not quite like a traditional pita, as it&apos;s fluffier and pocketless, but entirely superior. Be sure to order extra to take home!"
5,"Delicious, fresh, and affordable Mediterranean food!  Ordered take out through Grubhub on a Saturday night. The order was ready within 30-40 minutes of ordering. We shared the falafel and the hummus with bread. The falafel was so flavorful and had a fantastic texture that was a little crispy on the outside but very soft and moist on the inside. It came with a nice tahini sauce for dipping. The hummus was very smooth and creamy and the fresh bread was amazing! It had a great texture and was hearty. It complimented the hummus perfectly. I had the chicken kebab entree which was fantastic. The chicken was tender and flavorful as was the wheat couscous that came with the meal.  Loved the variety of roasted veggies as well. It was a large portion and made great leftovers. He had the wrap with ground beef and chicken and said that eat bite got better and better. Also came with fries. We will definitely be back to try more!"
5,"Come on admit it...every once in a while you wake up and are like &quot;what&apos;s missing in my life? It must be turkish coffee and baklava&quot;
I was overjoyed that this was not one of restaurants closed during the pandemic . Everyone who goes there is properly spaced. The room is devided by boxes.

If your mom was Turkish she would force you to eat everything you ordered in one sitting. But since that&apos;s not the case unless it is you can eat leftovers for another time.

My friend had the baklava and I had turkish coffee. Apparently you have to tell them if you want it extra hot, strong, more sugary or just a little sugary. I wanted mine just a,little sugary...

They give you this carrot salad that has I think mayonnaise and bread while you wait.

The people next to me come all the time and order Turkish pizza with coffee every few days. It looks razor thin and and has beef in it with no cheese. Something to come back and try.

I had some beef skewers as appetizers with what I thought was a side of taboule...that&apos;s not just a,side ...that&apos;s a portion for paul bunyan...yowza.

I chose the veggie options on the side very carefully because me and spicy dont get along. The baklava is the best in chicago or is on par with the best I&apos;ve ever had. Ironically I came here to prepare for a trip to Turkey in a few months...I think I&apos;m gonna have to prepare more. Awesome food spot that has indoor dining. Yes I put back the mask when they come over and ask us if we want more."
5,"Zizi&apos;s is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Chicago. I order from here 1-3 times a week depending on my schedule. The food is always fresh (even via delivery, and I live in Logan Square these days!), the people are incredibly friendly, and the prices are very reasonable especially considering the serving sizes and quality. Speaking of the serving sizes, most of the platters (chicken doner is my go-to) can easily make 2-3 hearty meals, and keep very well. The salads are also huge, and delicious. I am partial towards the kale and the Turkish feta, but they&apos;re all good. Add meat if that&apos;s your thing. 

Oh, and the bread. Get the bread. It is fresh, usually still warm, and amazing. Their desserts are solid too, especially if you&apos;re a rice pudding fan. Now that I type this, I&apos;m wondering why I didn&apos;t order rice pudding tonight....

Anyways, you can&apos;t go wrong here. Look at the menu, find something that sounds good to you in the moment,  go with it, and thank me later."
5,"Ordered the chicken doner kebab plate for takeout and a side of dolmas.
Every bit of it was delicious and one plate lasts me three meals! The chicken was perfect but best part is the buttery rice it comes with. I could eat this forever."
5,"Killer place: great food, large portion, nice staff, good price. They often throw in a little something too. I&apos;ve had a few gyro places in Chicago, even highly rated ones, and my disappointment was unresolved until going to Zizi&apos;s. 

The beef gyro sandwich, wrap, and fries are amazing. The former is so big that even my constantly overconsuming American ass can&apos;t finish it in one sitting."
5,"Let me start this by saying that I have been eating Mediterranean food since I was a little baby. This is THE BEST I have EVER had. I&apos;m a lentil soup SNOB and this red lentil is not only the best lentil soup I&apos;ve ever had, but the best SOUP I&apos;ve ever had. I can tell that this is a family business that takes great pride in their business and it shows in their food. 10/10, A+, literally amazing amazing food. The dolma is amazing, the chicken platter is amazing (my boyfriend LOVES it). Just amazing job. Thank you!! Will be addicted to this soup for years now."
5,"Excellent place. Ate here sitting out due to the &apos;rona times. 
Menu is simple and easy to get through. 
Had the chicken kabab and the Turkish flat bread with toppings called lahmacun. 
Excellent and flavorful. Also had a salad. 
3 dishes came to approx 40 USD 
Very much a mom (polish) + pop (Turkish) and kids store. 
The free bread was excellent and so was the carrot dip. 
Great value for money 
Would return and I strongly recommend!"

I wasn&apos;t expecting to love the arugula salad as much as I did, because it seemed fairly simple, but they managed to make it taste exceptionally good. I had never tried ratatouille before coming to Zizi&apos;s, but I was intrigued by the Pide with Eggplant Ratatouille so I ordered it the next time I visited -- it was delicious and light, wrapped in thin dough and served pre-sliced so it was easy to share. Zizi&apos;s is BYOB, and needless to say, everything pairs wonderfully with a bottle of wine.

The service is always great and I feel happy just thinking about the food here. Can&apos;t recommend it enough!"
5,"Amazing authentic Turkish halal restaurant. I loved the pies. They have great variety of options.
I would love to come back again"
5,"I love this place. It&apos;s easy, delicious and the price is always good. We&apos;ve only eaten in once a few years ago but otherwise it&apos;s all take out. And everything stays fresh. I highly recommend the platter with all of the dips. It&apos;s seriously it&apos;s own meal!"
4,"Zizi&apos;s is a nice little spot for Turkish cuisine. The owner is very friendly and attentive. They have good selection of different dishes. Sultan platter looked great, however they didn&apos;t ask how well we wanted our meat and it ended up being a little dry."
5,"My boyfriend ordered us food from here. It was so delicious, I ordered it again for myself the very next day. We got the lamb doner, and the chicken schwarma. The roasted veggies that came with these plates were so tasty, and different. Usually when you order Mediterranean, you get a protein, rice, and pita. I LOVE how they include the roasted veggies, it makes my meal feel more well rounded. And the homemade pita bread!!! SO good. This place is definitely on my greatest hits list in the city."
5,"This is going to be my new favorite, after-work snack pick-up spot. I ordered the cheese pide, just because I wanted something small and chill. I got a solid meal and evening snack out of my one order! It was so tasty and something new for me. I look forward to trying other items off of their menu. I ordered takeout because, again pandemic living, and it was easy, smooth, and early. Can&apos;t wait to try more and support local businesses during this wild time!"
5,"This place is open and delivering, they are family owned and their dishes are great ... The trifecta of food!  Their moussaka keeps me coming back. 
Don&apos;t cook dinner tonight, call them directly and order in!!"
4,"One of my favorite places for iskandar kabob. The tomato sauce that they pour over the lamb doner is super tasty. I&apos;m writing this review specially after ordering take out and it was just as good! The quality of the food was the same and the portion size was massive! My two year old really enjoyed the sujuk pide, it was pure cheesy goodness."
5,"I&apos;ve dined in and gotten takeout or delivery from Zizi&apos;s countless times and never had a bad experience. Food and service is consistently solid. Pretty interior with mosaic lamps makes this a fun restaurant to bring guests.

Menu must-haves include their carrot spread (free for dine-in), doner sandwiches, and lamacun or pizmahagun wrap. The true standout is their homemade bread, which comes on their sandwiches and alongside starters. Not quite like a traditional pita, as it&apos;s fluffier and pocketless, but entirely superior. Be sure to order extra to take home!"
5,"Delicious, fresh, and affordable Mediterranean food!  Ordered take out through Grubhub on a Saturday night. The order was ready within 30-40 minutes of ordering. We shared the falafel and the hummus with bread. The falafel was so flavorful and had a fantastic texture that was a little crispy on the outside but very soft and moist on the inside. It came with a nice tahini sauce for dipping. The hummus was very smooth and creamy and the fresh bread was amazing! It had a great texture and was hearty. It complimented the hummus perfectly. I had the chicken kebab entree which was fantastic. The chicken was tender and flavorful as was the wheat couscous that came with the meal.  Loved the variety of roasted veggies as well. It was a large portion and made great leftovers. He had the wrap with ground beef and chicken and said that eat bite got better and better. Also came with fries. We will definitely be back to try more!"
5,"Come on admit it...every once in a while you wake up and are like &quot;what&apos;s missing in my life? It must be turkish coffee and baklava&quot;
I was overjoyed that this was not one of restaurants closed during the pandemic . Everyone who goes there is properly spaced. The room is devided by boxes.

If your mom was Turkish she would force you to eat everything you ordered in one sitting. But since that&apos;s not the case unless it is you can eat leftovers for another time.

My friend had the baklava and I had turkish coffee. Apparently you have to tell them if you want it extra hot, strong, more sugary or just a little sugary. I wanted mine just a,little sugary...

They give you this carrot salad that has I think mayonnaise and bread while you wait.

The people next to me come all the time and order Turkish pizza with coffee every few days. It looks razor thin and and has beef in it with no cheese. Something to come back and try.

I had some beef skewers as appetizers with what I thought was a side of taboule...that&apos;s not just a,side ...that&apos;s a portion for paul bunyan...yowza.

I chose the veggie options on the side very carefully because me and spicy dont get along. The baklava is the best in chicago or is on par with the best I&apos;ve ever had. Ironically I came here to prepare for a trip to Turkey in a few months...I think I&apos;m gonna have to prepare more. Awesome food spot that has indoor dining. Yes I put back the mask when they come over and ask us if we want more."
5,"Zizi&apos;s is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Chicago. I order from here 1-3 times a week depending on my schedule. The food is always fresh (even via delivery, and I live in Logan Square these days!), the people are incredibly friendly, and the prices are very reasonable especially considering the serving sizes and quality. Speaking of the serving sizes, most of the platters (chicken doner is my go-to) can easily make 2-3 hearty meals, and keep very well. The salads are also huge, and delicious. I am partial towards the kale and the Turkish feta, but they&apos;re all good. Add meat if that&apos;s your thing. 

Oh, and the bread. Get the bread. It is fresh, usually still warm, and amazing. Their desserts are solid too, especially if you&apos;re a rice pudding fan. Now that I type this, I&apos;m wondering why I didn&apos;t order rice pudding tonight....

Anyways, you can&apos;t go wrong here. Look at the menu, find something that sounds good to you in the moment,  go with it, and thank me later."
5,"Ordered the chicken doner kebab plate for takeout and a side of dolmas.
Every bit of it was delicious and one plate lasts me three meals! The chicken was perfect but best part is the buttery rice it comes with. I could eat this forever."
5,"Killer place: great food, large portion, nice staff, good price. They often throw in a little something too. I&apos;ve had a few gyro places in Chicago, even highly rated ones, and my disappointment was unresolved until going to Zizi&apos;s. 

The beef gyro sandwich, wrap, and fries are amazing. The former is so big that even my constantly overconsuming American ass can&apos;t finish it in one sitting."
5,"Let me start this by saying that I have been eating Mediterranean food since I was a little baby. This is THE BEST I have EVER had. I&apos;m a lentil soup SNOB and this red lentil is not only the best lentil soup I&apos;ve ever had, but the best SOUP I&apos;ve ever had. I can tell that this is a family business that takes great pride in their business and it shows in their food. 10/10, A+, literally amazing amazing food. The dolma is amazing, the chicken platter is amazing (my boyfriend LOVES it). Just amazing job. Thank you!! Will be addicted to this soup for years now."
5,"Excellent place. Ate here sitting out due to the &apos;rona times. 
Menu is simple and easy to get through. 
Had the chicken kabab and the Turkish flat bread with toppings called lahmacun. 
Excellent and flavorful. Also had a salad. 
3 dishes came to approx 40 USD 
Very much a mom (polish) + pop (Turkish) and kids store. 
The free bread was excellent and so was the carrot dip. 
Great value for money 
Would return and I strongly recommend!"
4,"Overall: Arguably the best Turkish food in the area, with great prices to go with it.

The good: We started off with the lahmacun, which was thin, crisp, and flavorful. I&apos;d never had one before and, paired with the amazing and complimentary bread, was a great start to the meal. The bread was warm and soft, I had to contain myself to not eat more. The service was friendly, they have outdoor seating (though the inside&apos;s atmosphere is a nice touch), anad it&apos;s BYOB. Oh, and the prices are right.

The not-so-good: The Adana (lamb) wrap was great but didn&apos;t blow me away, nor did the fries. They were still great, but nothing out of this world.

Food: 8.5/10
Atmosphere: 8.5/10
Service: 8.5/10"
5,"We ordered doner kebab (gyros) platters. Everything tasted so good. We will be coming back here, again and again."

5,"My boyfriend ordered us food from here. It was so delicious, I ordered it again for myself the very next day. We got the lamb doner, and the chicken schwarma. The roasted veggies that came with these plates were so tasty, and different. Usually when you order Mediterranean, you get a protein, rice, and pita. I LOVE how they include the roasted veggies, it makes my meal feel more well rounded. And the homemade pita bread!!! SO good. This place is definitely on my greatest hits list in the city."
5,"This is going to be my new favorite, after-work snack pick-up spot. I ordered the cheese pide, just because I wanted something small and chill. I got a solid meal and evening snack out of my one order! It was so tasty and something new for me. I look forward to trying other items off of their menu. I ordered takeout because, again pandemic living, and it was easy, smooth, and early. Can&apos;t wait to try more and support local businesses during this wild time!"
5,"This place is open and delivering, they are family owned and their dishes are great ... The trifecta of food!  Their moussaka keeps me coming back. 
Don&apos;t cook dinner tonight, call them directly and order in!!"
4,"One of my favorite places for iskandar kabob. The tomato sauce that they pour over the lamb doner is super tasty. I&apos;m writing this review specially after ordering take out and it was just as good! The quality of the food was the same and the portion size was massive! My two year old really enjoyed the sujuk pide, it was pure cheesy goodness."
5,"I&apos;ve dined in and gotten takeout or delivery from Zizi&apos;s countless times and never had a bad experience. Food and service is consistently solid. Pretty interior with mosaic lamps makes this a fun restaurant to bring guests.

Menu must-haves include their carrot spread (free for dine-in), doner sandwiches, and lamacun or pizmahagun wrap. The true standout is their homemade bread, which comes on their sandwiches and alongside starters. Not quite like a traditional pita, as it&apos;s fluffier and pocketless, but entirely superior. Be sure to order extra to take home!"
5,"Delicious, fresh, and affordable Mediterranean food!  Ordered take out through Grubhub on a Saturday night. The order was ready within 30-40 minutes of ordering. We shared the falafel and the hummus with bread. The falafel was so flavorful and had a fantastic texture that was a little crispy on the outside but very soft and moist on the inside. It came with a nice tahini sauce for dipping. The hummus was very smooth and creamy and the fresh bread was amazing! It had a great texture and was hearty. It complimented the hummus perfectly. I had the chicken kebab entree which was fantastic. The chicken was tender and flavorful as was the wheat couscous that came with the meal.  Loved the variety of roasted veggies as well. It was a large portion and made great leftovers. He had the wrap with ground beef and chicken and said that eat bite got better and better. Also came with fries. We will definitely be back to try more!"
5,"Come on admit it...every once in a while you wake up and are like &quot;what&apos;s missing in my life? It must be turkish coffee and baklava&quot;
I was overjoyed that this was not one of restaurants closed during the pandemic . Everyone who goes there is properly spaced. The room is devided by boxes.

If your mom was Turkish she would force you to eat everything you ordered in one sitting. But since that&apos;s not the case unless it is you can eat leftovers for another time.

My friend had the baklava and I had turkish coffee. Apparently you have to tell them if you want it extra hot, strong, more sugary or just a little sugary. I wanted mine just a,little sugary...

They give you this carrot salad that has I think mayonnaise and bread while you wait.

The people next to me come all the time and order Turkish pizza with coffee every few days. It looks razor thin and and has beef in it with no cheese. Something to come back and try.

I had some beef skewers as appetizers with what I thought was a side of taboule...that&apos;s not just a,side ...that&apos;s a portion for paul bunyan...yowza.

I chose the veggie options on the side very carefully because me and spicy dont get along. The baklava is the best in chicago or is on par with the best I&apos;ve ever had. Ironically I came here to prepare for a trip to Turkey in a few months...I think I&apos;m gonna have to prepare more. Awesome food spot that has indoor dining. Yes I put back the mask when they come over and ask us if we want more."
5,"Zizi&apos;s is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Chicago. I order from here 1-3 times a week depending on my schedule. The food is always fresh (even via delivery, and I live in Logan Square these days!), the people are incredibly friendly, and the prices are very reasonable especially considering the serving sizes and quality. Speaking of the serving sizes, most of the platters (chicken doner is my go-to) can easily make 2-3 hearty meals, and keep very well. The salads are also huge, and delicious. I am partial towards the kale and the Turkish feta, but they&apos;re all good. Add meat if that&apos;s your thing. 

Oh, and the bread. Get the bread. It is fresh, usually still warm, and amazing. Their desserts are solid too, especially if you&apos;re a rice pudding fan. Now that I type this, I&apos;m wondering why I didn&apos;t order rice pudding tonight....

Anyways, you can&apos;t go wrong here. Look at the menu, find something that sounds good to you in the moment,  go with it, and thank me later."
5,"Ordered the chicken doner kebab plate for takeout and a side of dolmas.
Every bit of it was delicious and one plate lasts me three meals! The chicken was perfect but best part is the buttery rice it comes with. I could eat this forever."
5,"Killer place: great food, large portion, nice staff, good price. They often throw in a little something too. I&apos;ve had a few gyro places in Chicago, even highly rated ones, and my disappointment was unresolved until going to Zizi&apos;s. 

The beef gyro sandwich, wrap, and fries are amazing. The former is so big that even my constantly overconsuming American ass can&apos;t finish it in one sitting."
5,"Let me start this by saying that I have been eating Mediterranean food since I was a little baby. This is THE BEST I have EVER had. I&apos;m a lentil soup SNOB and this red lentil is not only the best lentil soup I&apos;ve ever had, but the best SOUP I&apos;ve ever had. I can tell that this is a family business that takes great pride in their business and it shows in their food. 10/10, A+, literally amazing amazing food. The dolma is amazing, the chicken platter is amazing (my boyfriend LOVES it). Just amazing job. Thank you!! Will be addicted to this soup for years now."
5,"Excellent place. Ate here sitting out due to the &apos;rona times. 
Menu is simple and easy to get through. 
Had the chicken kabab and the Turkish flat bread with toppings called lahmacun. 
Excellent and flavorful. Also had a salad. 
3 dishes came to approx 40 USD 
Very much a mom (polish) + pop (Turkish) and kids store. 
The free bread was excellent and so was the carrot dip. 
Great value for money 
Would return and I strongly recommend!"
4,"Overall: Arguably the best Turkish food in the area, with great prices to go with it.

The good: We started off with the lahmacun, which was thin, crisp, and flavorful. I&apos;d never had one before and, paired with the amazing and complimentary bread, was a great start to the meal. The bread was warm and soft, I had to contain myself to not eat more. The service was friendly, they have outdoor seating (though the inside&apos;s atmosphere is a nice touch), anad it&apos;s BYOB. Oh, and the prices are right.

The not-so-good: The Adana (lamb) wrap was great but didn&apos;t blow me away, nor did the fries. They were still great, but nothing out of this world.

Food: 8.5/10
Atmosphere: 8.5/10
Service: 8.5/10"
5,"We ordered doner kebab (gyros) platters. Everything tasted so good. We will be coming back here, again and again."
5,"Couldn&apos;t love this place more. Fresh, delicious food, friendly service and a great little outdoor patio. An awesome family run Chicago business!"
5,"Absolutely delicious! We got a chicken wrap, doner sandwich and feta platter, all amazing!! The homemade bread was to die for as well. Great food!"
5,"Zizi&apos;s is such a delight. They have an amazing menu and a cozy atmosphere that makes you feel at home. But if that doesn&apos;t pull you in immediately, the complimentary crispy bread and carrot spread will. 

The first time I came here, my friend and I shared the falafel wrap (which comes with really great fries) and arugula caprese salad. The falafel is wonderful and its texture is on the creamier side. I wasn&apos;t expecting to love the arugula salad as much as I did, because it seemed fairly simple, but they managed to make it taste exceptionally good. I had never tried ratatouille before coming to Zizi&apos;s, but I was intrigued by the Pide with Eggplant Ratatouille so I ordered it the next time I visited -- it was delicious and light, wrapped in thin dough and served pre-sliced so it was easy to share. Zizi&apos;s is BYOB, and needless to say, everything pairs wonderfully with a bottle of wine.

The service is always great and I feel happy just thinking about the food here. Can&apos;t recommend it enough!"

I would love to come back again"
