5,"This tour was absolutely fantastic. After living in Chicago for 20 years, I&apos;m not sure why during this pandemic I decided it was time to take the tour, but wow am I happy I did! We came on a Saturday afternoon and the boat looked socially- distanced full. Chairs were spaced far apart and there was plenty of space between. Our guide was very knowledgeable and provided lots of fun tidbits of Chicago history along with all the architectural information. The tour was just the right length (about 90 minutes). It was cold and windy on the top of the boat but still the tour was very enjoyable. Pricing at ~$50 seems a little steep for a group tour, but in the end I was very happy we did this."
5,"On Friday noon I stopped by the Architectural Center for its exhibits. For a $12 admission I entered into its 3 exhibits - a rotating gallery, the skyscraper gallery, and the Chicago gallery.

The rotating gallery featured multiple wall displays about designing cities for the 21st century, taking into consideration sustainability, greenery, and post-automobile transit. The exhibit, as a guest exhibit, was the smallest, providing ~10-15 minutes of reading.

The second exhibit, the skyscraper gallery, featured many replica models of skyscrapers and their descriptions. Icons such as the Sears Tower made an appearance. Additionally, the gallery showcased design considerations, such as mass dampers to counteract building sway due to high winds and the evolution of structural reinforcement.

The third exhibit, the Chicago gallery, traces the city&apos;s architectural evolution of not only high rises, but also smaller, single-family swellings. Moreover, it has a scale model of the city itself for a neat bird&apos;s eye view.

In all, this entertained me for an hour, and I got to learn about an iconic American city!"
4,"I visited the exhibits that are housed on-site.  I&apos;ve heard great things about their tours, but I haven&apos;t ever been on one. I have an interest in architecture after spending a couple of years working for one of the Frank Lloyd Wright organizations, so prior to this, most of my time enjoying architecture is self-planned wandering.  

The admission price seems about right for the size of the place ($12 general, $8 students). 

The exhibits were neat. One of them was on skyscrapers and the other was the scale model of a portion of the city.  The facts about the various city buildings were fascinating to me!  The larger-scale photos of planned buildings held my attention.  I&apos;m excited to see how the city continues to evolve as time goes on.  

So, I probably won&apos;t go back unless if I&apos;m bringing guests from out of town. I think the Architecture Center itself is definitely worth at least one visit for locals or tourists alike."
5,"We toured the Chicago Architecture Center during Open House Chicago and it was a fantastic experience! Although they offer a wide variety of architectural tours all over the city, their building itself is a treasure not to be missed. They sell Chicago merchandise and schedule tours out of this space so it&apos;s also open to the public.

The first floor holds a room sized model of the entire city of Chicago. It is absolutely unbelievable! We watched a movie there that highlights much of the city&apos;s history and architecture. One of the most dramatic parts was the highlighting (in orange flame looking lighting) of the entire area the Chicago fire engulfed. The sheer scope of the area destroyed really stuck with me. 

The 2nd floor holds models of some of the most iconic skyscrapers and new innovative architectural designs around the world. It&apos;s great fun and very educational to explore. 

The Chicago Architecture Center is true gem the heart of downtown Chicago!"
5,"The new and improved Chicago Architecture Center moved from its old spot across from the Art Institute to its location on Wacker Drive along the Chicago River.  Although there is now an entrance fee, you can experience a multimedia show that centers upon a wonderful model of downtown Chicago and its plethora of architectural towers and landmarks.  The upper level features some very cool models and descriptions of architecturally significant skyscrapers.  The gift shop is still a fun place to look for Chicago and architecture-related gifts, and this is the launching point for many of the popular walking tours.  Definitely check out the Chicago Architecture Center if you are a fan of the world-renowned architecture to be discovered in Chicago."
5,I love the model buildings upstairs. A lot of time was spent on the details of the exhibits and I am happy I stopped in.
3,"The museum was good, the front desk staff was catatonic.
I became a member this week to support the organization and made a visit to the center on Friday, July 31.  It was at 10am and no guests were there except us.  Neither front desk employees greeted us, one just blankly stared and the other looked away, so I chose him. The exchange we had to get into the museum was so unwelcoming and difficult that I expect tourists must have negative perception of Chicago after a visit - not what I would expect for a &quot;gateway center.&quot;  Luckily, an employee on the third floor was engaging and informative about the buildings and architects.  Overall the museum is well planned and worth a trip. Probably will not renew membership."
5,"I was born and raised here in Chicago. I feel so ashamed that I never visited CAC. I had to pick up my volunteer packet for the upcoming Open House Chicago. The first location for the volunteers to pick up their packet was here at CAC. The location area gives you a nice beautiful view of some of the historic buildings here in Chicago. 

The Skyscraper Gallery on the second floor is worth seeing. There are so many exhibits and displays to enjoy and learn the history of the architecture in Chicago.

After you take a tour there is a store on the main floor with many cool things to purchase.  The staff was very friendly with plenty of smiles ready to help in anyway. This is just not a place for tourist. It&apos;s for anyone and any age to enjoy and learn about the history and enjoy the beautiful architectural of our great city."
5,Needed to kill some time &amp; the CAC was right across the street from our hotel so we decided to visit. Tickets were $12 to view the exhibit. We were literally the only ones there besides the workers but never were we feel like we were being followed around. They have a large 3D model of the city which lights up certain buildings if you press the buttons on the screen. I love interactivity! Very interesting place to read up on Chicago&apos;s architecture.
3,"This review is based on the center, itself, and not on any of their tours.

A friend and I decided to check out the relatively new center off of Michigan Avenue.   The center has three levels....the first is the retail which offers many &quot;Chicago theme&quot; its such as games, magnets, t-shirts/ hoodies to name a few.  The items were priced more on the higher side.

The main level offers the desk for the various tours and special exhibits.  When we were there, the O&apos;Hare Airport expansion exhibition was there.  

One the third level, are scaled high rise buildings that are located in Chicago and many throughout the world.  I thought, they would have more exhibits on the city than they had.

I really don&apos;t think I would return to the center unless I reserve one of their tours."
3,"I was visiting Chicago this past weekend with some family and friends. We had taken CAC&apos;s architecture boat tour which included admission to the CAC. Two of our party rushed to get to a Cubs game, but my friend and I decided to check the CAC out since we&apos;d technically already paid for it. It&apos;s small, but it&apos;s worth running into if you have a few minutes. They have a pretty cool model of Chicago&apos;s downtown Loop and some models of skyscrapers with information about them. It&apos;s not a lot, but if you&apos;re getting in for free like we did, check it out! They also have a very nice gift shop. It&apos;s very small, but I&apos;m glad we stopped in for a few minutes."
4,"Took the Golden Age Tour and really enjoyed it. Tour guide Ericka is wonderful! Front desk ticket sales dude could lighten up a bit. Life isn&apos;t death. 
Great tour!"
5,"Whether or not you consider yourself an architectural aficionado, this museum/center/foundation is a must, if you live in Chicago or are visiting the city.  Chicago is the architectural beacon for the world.  The skyline, the buildings, the urban scape, is without a rival, in my immodest opinion.  

The center provides a historical, economic, and lifestyle context for the fabulous architecture that surrounds you in &quot;the city of big shoulders.&quot; The tours provided by the foundation are amazing.  Even with my uncontrollable A.D.D., I was devouring every word from my engaging and intellectually knowledgeable docent John.  I think I know everything, as evidenced by my arrogant reviews.  However, I received an education from John that no school has been able to provide, and I went to some good ones. 

I am hoping to take a different tour each day I&apos;m in Chicago.  It was that good.  The museum itself is designed well, as expected from an architecturally based foundation.  There are highlights, such as the model city, but everything, including the gift shop, was worthwhile and interesting.

Hey, I&apos;m not a museum/class/tour kind of person.  Between my A.D.D. and need to be the center of attention at all times, I have an extinction rate of about 10 minutes.  But I loved everything about both the tour and the museum.  Tomorrow, I hope to take the architectural river cruise.  I want to thank the Chicago Architectural Center for providing a great service, not only for Chicago, but for every visitor.  Bravo!"
4,"Bottom Line:  A nice gift, book and souvenir store emphasizing Chicago and architecture. You can book tours here too.

The Chicago Architecture Foundation may be best known for their river cruises but they also have a nice store on Michigan Avenue and they offer other tours too. The store is very tasteful and you can get momentos of Chicago as well as items that play homage to architecture.  They offer books, lego sets and Frank Lloyd Wright decor among many other quality items.  I enjoyed looking at the Chicago artwork as well as the toys.  You will not find cheesy souvenirs here."
5,"I now love Chicago! The tours were the best! We did the bust tour through neighborhoods in Chicago. The guide was awesome! We did the riverboat tour to , on a rainy day! It was still awesome! And yes we did Frank Lloyd Wright tours too... 2 of them on Oak Park! It was the best. My only regret was I didn&apos;t go toWrigley Field....but next time! Oh and the Museum and gift shop were great!! Do not miss it!"
5,"02/28/18 Leap Year Yelp had an open invitation at The Chicago Architectural Foundation (CAF) to address 7 buildings + 1 that are in danger of being replaced.  I think I was the lone Yelp representative at this event. (I know Luai tried, but was told the event was full). 

All of the buildings have some historic significance and to see them removed would be tragic.  I know about progress and the constantly evolving landscape, but a few of the structures are very significant like Union Station (open in 1925) w/it&apos;s Great Hall.  Union Stations Great Hall is a magnificent space, it would be trulto see something of such historic significance removed from the urban landscape.  

The State Illinois Building?  I can&apos;t believe they are even considering removing this building, but unfortunately the State with its financial woes have allowed this building fall into serious disrepair.  This building has a very impressive 17 story atrium surrounded by offices around the perimeter.

I remember this block before The State of Illinois Building was built.  The old Greyhound Bus Station use to be there along with The Double RR where Joel Daley (channel 7 news anchor) &amp; The sundowners use to play country music.  I know this is going to date me, but how many of you remember Fahey Flynn &amp; Joel Daley.

5,"Updated review:
As of early 2019 the move is done and the new place is beautiful! Besides the original model that is much expanded, there are now several very large scale models of tall structures from around the world, all built 91:1 scale as I recall.

Be sure to watch the short movie by the city model. I found it very informative in spite of having watched numerous channel 11 PBS documentaries about Chicago architecture.

Full ADA wheelchair accessibility inside and out too. Thanks!

This model has always been GREAT.  I can&apos;t wait to see the NEW and IMPROVED model!"
5,"Along with a new name, the CAC (formerly the Chicago Architecture Foundation) moved to a prominent riverfront location.  

On the first floor you&apos;ll learn about visionary architects and city planners who shaped our city and gave it its distinctive skyline; explore five Chicago neighborhoods through an architectural lens, and get a bird&apos;s-eye view of Chicago&apos;s 234 square miles via a giant color-coded map. The highlight is the &apos;Chicago City Model Experience&apos;, which tells unique stories via video and interactive touch screens. 

The second floor of the museum has scale models (one of which is is 38 feet tall!) of five iconic high-rises around the world. Other smaller models which display famous skyscrapers are also featured (including ones that were proposed but never built), and has a rotating gallery with exhibits that change depending on current and future projects.

Full disclosure: my firm designed the new-and-improved CAC, and is featured prominently throughout the center, but company pride aside, I still think this is a terrific and educational place to go. I can&apos;t even begin to describe what it&apos;s like to see these models in person; you really get an unrivaled sense of what these larger-than-life buildings are like in real life that can&apos;t be duplicated by photos or videos, which is of course why these models are built.

This is also a place to purchase tickets to one of their many wonderful tours of and around Chicago. (Being on one of the tours gets you discounted or free admission to the CAC.)

The gift shop is also noteworthy, and rivals any modern art museum&apos;s. You&apos;ll find great Chicago-centric gifts and trinkets for architectural junkies, souvenirs, or anyone who&apos;s a fan of Chicago or its architecture.

Definitely a worthwhile place to check out whether you&apos;re an architecture enthusiast or a casual admirer."
5,"I was here for the first time and brought my 9 year old son.  He is into maps and the buildings of Chicago...  he could not get enough of this place.

A big interactive model, a short movie, and into about the history of Chicago.  They also have a gallery devoted to the rest of the world&apos;s tallest buildings as well.

We got in for $5 after going on the associated architecture river tour.  I highly recommend the combination."
5,"This review is for Docent David Smith who is perfect to lead the commentary (as he is a retired Professor and Seasoned Docent) on American Architect Frank Lloyd Wright.  Mr. Smith narrated the journey on the Chicago Architecture Foundation&apos;s (CAF&apos;s) round trip bus tour to visit the Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio and the Unity Temple in Oak Park, Illinois.  

At the beginning of the journey Mr. Smith pointed out various architectural highlights of Chicago until the bus reached the expressway at which point he provided an historical overview of architect Frank Lloyd Wright-his life and legacy...both personal and professional....I especially enjoyed Mr. Smith&apos;s peppering of books about architecture and Frank Lloyd Wright...i.e.

&quot;Loving Frank&quot; by Nancy Horan about Mr. Wright&apos;s illicit love affair with Mamah Northwick at the beginning of the 20th Century;

&quot;The Women&quot; by T.C. Boyle -voiced from the perspectives of the four main women in Mr. Wright&apos;s Life;

&quot;The Seven Lamps of Architecture&quot; by John Ruskin which examines the influence of nature on architecture;

and &quot;The Blocks of Venice&quot; which was referenced but I could not find....on-line?  Someone throw me a bone aka message...if you know..

Like a true academic and retired professor he introduced terminology and trademarks which were important in understanding and identifying the unique architectural features exhibited in Mr. Wright&apos;s buildings such as:

1.  &quot;Light Screens&quot;=Windows allowing the natural world into the structures
2.  Compress and Release...from small narrow spaces which lead to open large spaces
3.  The Journey of Discovery&quot;....the unique entryway to each structure is located on the side of most buildings
4.  The influence of Japanese Art (Block Prints-Hokusai) on Mr. Wright&apos;s thinking and constructs

...these are just a few...

The tour alone on the bus was unique, captivating, and provided inspiring insight by an academic (retired professor) and CAF Docent who really enjoys the subject matter and shares it in a lively way with his audience (us!).  The CAF...is very, very lucky to have Retired Professor David Smith as a Docent- as are all participants who have the opportunity to obtain a ticket for this tour and learn about the architect Frank Lloyd Wright.  

Thank you for a wonderful experience as my parents were visiting from the East Coast of The United States and had limited time with me...we all agreed it was one of the highlights of the trip that we will always have to share and remember our time together or explore and discuss through your reading recommendations!  

Mr. Smith is indeed an &quot;exceptional&quot; Docent!

We came on a Saturday afternoon and the boat looked socially- distanced full. Chairs were spaced far apart and there was plenty of space between.

Mr. Smith narrated the journey on the Chicago Architecture Foundation&apos;s (CAF&apos;s) round trip bus tour to visit the Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio and the Unity Temple in Oak Park, Illinois.  

At the beginning of the journey Mr. Smith pointed out various architectural highlights of Chicago until the bus reached the expressway at which point he provided an historical overview of architect Frank Lloyd Wright-his life and legacy...both personal and professional....I especially enjoyed Mr. Smith&apos;s peppering of books about architecture and Frank Lloyd Wright...i.e.

&quot;Loving Frank&quot; by Nancy Horan about Mr. Wright&apos;s illicit love affair with Mamah Northwick at the beginning of the 20th Century;

&quot;The Women&quot; by T.C. Boyle -voiced from the perspectives of the four main women in Mr. Wright&apos;s Life;

&quot;The Seven Lamps of Architecture&quot; by John Ruskin which examines the influence of nature on architecture;

and &quot;The Blocks of Venice&quot; which was referenced but I could not find....on-line?  Someone throw me a bone aka message...if you know..

Like a true academic and retired professor he introduced terminology and trademarks which were important in understanding and identifying the unique architectural features exhibited in Mr. Wright&apos;s buildings such as:

1.  &quot;Light Screens&quot;=Windows allowing the natural world into the structures
2.  Compress and Release...from small narrow spaces which lead to open large spaces
3.  The Journey of Discovery&quot;....the unique entryway to each structure is located on the side of most buildings
4.  The influence of Japanese Art (Block Prints-Hokusai) on Mr. Wright&apos;s thinking and constructs

...these are just a few...

The tour alone on the bus was unique, captivating, and provided inspiring insight by an academic (retired professor) and CAF Docent who really enjoys the subject matter and shares it in a lively way with his audience (us!).  The CAF...is very, very lucky to have Retired Professor David Smith as a Docent- as are all participants who have the opportunity to obtain a ticket for this tour and learn about the architect Frank Lloyd Wright.  

Thank you for a wonderful experience as my parents were visiting from the East Coast of The United States and had limited time with me...we all agreed it was one of the highlights of the trip that we will always have to share and remember our time together or explore and discuss through your reading recommendations!  

Mr. Smith is indeed an &quot;exceptional&quot; Docent!

5,"This tour was absolutely fantastic. After living in Chicago for 20 years, I&apos;m not sure why during this pandemic I decided it was time to take the tour, but wow am I happy I did! We came on a Saturday afternoon and the boat looked socially- distanced full. Chairs were spaced far apart and there was plenty of space between. Our guide was very knowledgeable and provided lots of fun tidbits of Chicago history along with all the architectural information. The tour was just the right length (about 90 minutes). It was cold and windy on the top of the boat but still the tour was very enjoyable. Pricing at ~$50 seems a little steep for a group tour, but in the end I was very happy we did this."
5,"On Friday noon I stopped by the Architectural Center for its exhibits. For a $12 admission I entered into its 3 exhibits - a rotating gallery, the skyscraper gallery, and the Chicago gallery.

The rotating gallery featured multiple wall displays about designing cities for the 21st century, taking into consideration sustainability, greenery, and post-automobile transit. The exhibit, as a guest exhibit, was the smallest, providing ~10-15 minutes of reading.

The second exhibit, the skyscraper gallery, featured many replica models of skyscrapers and their descriptions. Icons such as the Sears Tower made an appearance. Additionally, the gallery showcased design considerations, such as mass dampers to counteract building sway due to high winds and the evolution of structural reinforcement.

The third exhibit, the Chicago gallery, traces the city&apos;s architectural evolution of not only high rises, but also smaller, single-family swellings. Moreover, it has a scale model of the city itself for a neat bird&apos;s eye view.

In all, this entertained me for an hour, and I got to learn about an iconic American city!"
4,"I visited the exhibits that are housed on-site.  I&apos;ve heard great things about their tours, but I haven&apos;t ever been on one. I have an interest in architecture after spending a couple of years working for one of the Frank Lloyd Wright organizations, so prior to this, most of my time enjoying architecture is self-planned wandering.  

The admission price seems about right for the size of the place ($12 general, $8 students). 

The exhibits were neat. One of them was on skyscrapers and the other was the scale model of a portion of the city.  The facts about the various city buildings were fascinating to me!  The larger-scale photos of planned buildings held my attention.  I&apos;m excited to see how the city continues to evolve as time goes on.  

So, I probably won&apos;t go back unless if I&apos;m bringing guests from out of town. I think the Architecture Center itself is definitely worth at least one visit for locals or tourists alike."
5,"We toured the Chicago Architecture Center during Open House Chicago and it was a fantastic experience! Although they offer a wide variety of architectural tours all over the city, their building itself is a treasure not to be missed. They sell Chicago merchandise and schedule tours out of this space so it&apos;s also open to the public.

The first floor holds a room sized model of the entire city of Chicago. It is absolutely unbelievable! We watched a movie there that highlights much of the city&apos;s history and architecture. One of the most dramatic parts was the highlighting (in orange flame looking lighting) of the entire area the Chicago fire engulfed. The sheer scope of the area destroyed really stuck with me. 

The 2nd floor holds models of some of the most iconic skyscrapers and new innovative architectural designs around the world. It&apos;s great fun and very educational to explore. 

The Chicago Architecture Center is true gem the heart of downtown Chicago!"
5,"The new and improved Chicago Architecture Center moved from its old spot across from the Art Institute to its location on Wacker Drive along the Chicago River.  Although there is now an entrance fee, you can experience a multimedia show that centers upon a wonderful model of downtown Chicago and its plethora of architectural towers and landmarks.  The upper level features some very cool models and descriptions of architecturally significant skyscrapers.  The gift shop is still a fun place to look for Chicago and architecture-related gifts, and this is the launching point for many of the popular walking tours.  Definitely check out the Chicago Architecture Center if you are a fan of the world-renowned architecture to be discovered in Chicago."
5,I love the model buildings upstairs. A lot of time was spent on the details of the exhibits and I am happy I stopped in.
3,"The museum was good, the front desk staff was catatonic.
I became a member this week to support the organization and made a visit to the center on Friday, July 31.  It was at 10am and no guests were there except us.  Neither front desk employees greeted us, one just blankly stared and the other looked away, so I chose him. The exchange we had to get into the museum was so unwelcoming and difficult that I expect tourists must have negative perception of Chicago after a visit - not what I would expect for a &quot;gateway center.&quot;  Luckily, an employee on the third floor was engaging and informative about the buildings and architects.  Overall the museum is well planned and worth a trip. Probably will not renew membership."
5,"I was born and raised here in Chicago. I feel so ashamed that I never visited CAC. I had to pick up my volunteer packet for the upcoming Open House Chicago. The first location for the volunteers to pick up their packet was here at CAC. The location area gives you a nice beautiful view of some of the historic buildings here in Chicago. 

The Skyscraper Gallery on the second floor is worth seeing. There are so many exhibits and displays to enjoy and learn the history of the architecture in Chicago.

After you take a tour there is a store on the main floor with many cool things to purchase.  The staff was very friendly with plenty of smiles ready to help in anyway. This is just not a place for tourist. It&apos;s for anyone and any age to enjoy and learn about the history and enjoy the beautiful architectural of our great city."
5,Needed to kill some time &amp; the CAC was right across the street from our hotel so we decided to visit. Tickets were $12 to view the exhibit. We were literally the only ones there besides the workers but never were we feel like we were being followed around. They have a large 3D model of the city which lights up certain buildings if you press the buttons on the screen. I love interactivity! Very interesting place to read up on Chicago&apos;s architecture.
3,"This review is based on the center, itself, and not on any of their tours.

A friend and I decided to check out the relatively new center off of Michigan Avenue.   The center has three levels....the first is the retail which offers many &quot;Chicago theme&quot; its such as games, magnets, t-shirts/ hoodies to name a few.  The items were priced more on the higher side.

The main level offers the desk for the various tours and special exhibits.  When we were there, the O&apos;Hare Airport expansion exhibition was there.  

One the third level, are scaled high rise buildings that are located in Chicago and many throughout the world.  I thought, they would have more exhibits on the city than they had.

I really don&apos;t think I would return to the center unless I reserve one of their tours."
3,"I was visiting Chicago this past weekend with some family and friends. We had taken CAC&apos;s architecture boat tour which included admission to the CAC. Two of our party rushed to get to a Cubs game, but my friend and I decided to check the CAC out since we&apos;d technically already paid for it. It&apos;s small, but it&apos;s worth running into if you have a few minutes. They have a pretty cool model of Chicago&apos;s downtown Loop and some models of skyscrapers with information about them. It&apos;s not a lot, but if you&apos;re getting in for free like we did, check it out! They also have a very nice gift shop. It&apos;s very small, but I&apos;m glad we stopped in for a few minutes."
4,"Took the Golden Age Tour and really enjoyed it. Tour guide Ericka is wonderful! Front desk ticket sales dude could lighten up a bit. Life isn&apos;t death. 
Great tour!"
5,"Whether or not you consider yourself an architectural aficionado, this museum/center/foundation is a must, if you live in Chicago or are visiting the city.  Chicago is the architectural beacon for the world.  The skyline, the buildings, the urban scape, is without a rival, in my immodest opinion.  

The center provides a historical, economic, and lifestyle context for the fabulous architecture that surrounds you in &quot;the city of big shoulders.&quot; The tours provided by the foundation are amazing.  Even with my uncontrollable A.D.D., I was devouring every word from my engaging and intellectually knowledgeable docent John.  I think I know everything, as evidenced by my arrogant reviews.  However, I received an education from John that no school has been able to provide, and I went to some good ones. 

I am hoping to take a different tour each day I&apos;m in Chicago.  It was that good.  The museum itself is designed well, as expected from an architecturally based foundation.  There are highlights, such as the model city, but everything, including the gift shop, was worthwhile and interesting.

Hey, I&apos;m not a museum/class/tour kind of person.  Between my A.D.D. and need to be the center of attention at all times, I have an extinction rate of about 10 minutes.  But I loved everything about both the tour and the museum.  Tomorrow, I hope to take the architectural river cruise.  I want to thank the Chicago Architectural Center for providing a great service, not only for Chicago, but for every visitor.  Bravo!"
4,"Bottom Line:  A nice gift, book and souvenir store emphasizing Chicago and architecture. You can book tours here too.

The Chicago Architecture Foundation may be best known for their river cruises but they also have a nice store on Michigan Avenue and they offer other tours too. The store is very tasteful and you can get momentos of Chicago as well as items that play homage to architecture.  They offer books, lego sets and Frank Lloyd Wright decor among many other quality items.  I enjoyed looking at the Chicago artwork as well as the toys.  You will not find cheesy souvenirs here."
5,"I now love Chicago! The tours were the best! We did the bust tour through neighborhoods in Chicago. The guide was awesome! We did the riverboat tour to , on a rainy day! It was still awesome! And yes we did Frank Lloyd Wright tours too... 2 of them on Oak Park! It was the best. My only regret was I didn&apos;t go toWrigley Field....but next time! Oh and the Museum and gift shop were great!! Do not miss it!"
5,"02/28/18 Leap Year Yelp had an open invitation at The Chicago Architectural Foundation (CAF) to address 7 buildings + 1 that are in danger of being replaced.  I think I was the lone Yelp representative at this event. (I know Luai tried, but was told the event was full). 

All of the buildings have some historic significance and to see them removed would be tragic.  I know about progress and the constantly evolving landscape, but a few of the structures are very significant like Union Station (open in 1925) w/it&apos;s Great Hall.  Union Stations Great Hall is a magnificent space, it would be trulto see something of such historic significance removed from the urban landscape.  

The State Illinois Building?  I can&apos;t believe they are even considering removing this building, but unfortunately the State with its financial woes have allowed this building fall into serious disrepair.  This building has a very impressive 17 story atrium surrounded by offices around the perimeter.

I remember this block before The State of Illinois Building was built.  The old Greyhound Bus Station use to be there along with The Double RR where Joel Daley (channel 7 news anchor) &amp; The sundowners use to play country music.  I know this is going to date me, but how many of you remember Fahey Flynn &amp; Joel Daley.

The Chicago Architectural Foundation is located in The Railway Exchange Building @ 224 S. Michigan Ave.  designed by Daniel Burnham.  Inside there is a model of Chicago 

There is a scale model of Chicago from North Michigan Ave to Soldier Field to the south.  Lake Michigan on the east to west of the Chicago River.  There is also an interactive computer monitor that students were using along with designs of buildings hanging from a rail around the perimeter of the space. M"
5,"Updated review:
As of early 2019 the move is done and the new place is beautiful! Besides the original model that is much expanded, there are now several very large scale models of tall structures from around the world, all built 91:1 scale as I recall.

Be sure to watch the short movie by the city model. I found it very informative in spite of having watched numerous channel 11 PBS documentaries about Chicago architecture.

Full ADA wheelchair accessibility inside and out too. Thanks!

Original review:
On 3/20/2018 the Chicago model is moving to 111 E. Wacker Dr. (see pic of sign)  Other photos also show the new location is now being remodeled and an artist rendering of the future finished product.

This model has always been GREAT.  I can&apos;t wait to see the NEW and IMPROVED model!"
5,"Along with a new name, the CAC (formerly the Chicago Architecture Foundation) moved to a prominent riverfront location.  

On the first floor you&apos;ll learn about visionary architects and city planners who shaped our city and gave it its distinctive skyline; explore five Chicago neighborhoods through an architectural lens, and get a bird&apos;s-eye view of Chicago&apos;s 234 square miles via a giant color-coded map. The highlight is the &apos;Chicago City Model Experience&apos;, which tells unique stories via video and interactive touch screens. 

The second floor of the museum has scale models (one of which is is 38 feet tall!) of five iconic high-rises around the world. Other smaller models which display famous skyscrapers are also featured (including ones that were proposed but never built), and has a rotating gallery with exhibits that change depending on current and future projects.

Full disclosure: my firm designed the new-and-improved CAC, and is featured prominently throughout the center, but company pride aside, I still think this is a terrific and educational place to go. I can&apos;t even begin to describe what it&apos;s like to see these models in person; you really get an unrivaled sense of what these larger-than-life buildings are like in real life that can&apos;t be duplicated by photos or videos, which is of course why these models are built.

This is also a place to purchase tickets to one of their many wonderful tours of and around Chicago. (Being on one of the tours gets you discounted or free admission to the CAC.)

The gift shop is also noteworthy, and rivals any modern art museum&apos;s. You&apos;ll find great Chicago-centric gifts and trinkets for architectural junkies, souvenirs, or anyone who&apos;s a fan of Chicago or its architecture.

Definitely a worthwhile place to check out whether you&apos;re an architecture enthusiast or a casual admirer."
5,"I was here for the first time and brought my 9 year old son.  He is into maps and the buildings of Chicago...  he could not get enough of this place.

A big interactive model, a short movie, and into about the history of Chicago.  They also have a gallery devoted to the rest of the world&apos;s tallest buildings as well.

We got in for $5 after going on the associated architecture river tour.  I highly recommend the combination."

Be sure to watch the short movie by the city model. I found it very informative in spite of having watched numerous channel 11 PBS documentaries about Chicago architecture.

Full ADA wheelchair accessibility inside and out too. Thanks!

Original review:
On 3/20/2018 the Chicago model is moving to 111 E. Wacker Dr. (see pic of sign)  Other photos also show the new location is now being remodeled and an artist rendering of the future finished product.

This model has always been GREAT.  I can&apos;t wait to see the NEW and IMPROVED model!"
5,"Along with a new name, the CAC (formerly the Chicago Architecture Foundation) moved to a prominent riverfront location.  

On the first floor you&apos;ll learn about visionary architects and city planners who shaped our city and gave it its distinctive skyline; explore five Chicago neighborhoods through an architectural lens, and get a bird&apos;s-eye view of Chicago&apos;s 234 square miles via a giant color-coded map. The highlight is the &apos;Chicago City Model Experience&apos;, which tells unique stories via video and interactive touch screens. 

The second floor of the museum has scale models (one of which is is 38 feet tall!) of five iconic high-rises around the world. Other smaller models which display famous skyscrapers are also featured (including ones that were proposed but never built), and has a rotating gallery with exhibits that change depending on current and future projects.

Full disclosure: my firm designed the new-and-improved CAC, and is featured prominently throughout the center, but company pride aside, I still think this is a terrific and educational place to go. I can&apos;t even begin to describe what it&apos;s like to see these models in person; you really get an unrivaled sense of what these larger-than-life buildings are like in real life that can&apos;t be duplicated by photos or videos, which is of course why these models are built.

This is also a place to purchase tickets to one of their many wonderful tours of and around Chicago. (Being on one of the tours gets you discounted or free admission to the CAC.)

The gift shop is also noteworthy, and rivals any modern art museum&apos;s. You&apos;ll find great Chicago-centric gifts and trinkets for architectural junkies, souvenirs, or anyone who&apos;s a fan of Chicago or its architecture.

Definitely a worthwhile place to check out whether you&apos;re an architecture enthusiast or a casual admirer."
5,"I was here for the first time and brought my 9 year old son.  He is into maps and the buildings of Chicago...  he could not get enough of this place.

A big interactive model, a short movie, and into about the history of Chicago.  They also have a gallery devoted to the rest of the world&apos;s tallest buildings as well.

We got in for $5 after going on the associated architecture river tour.  I highly recommend the combination."
5,"This review is for Docent David Smith who is perfect to lead the commentary (as he is a retired Professor and Seasoned Docent) on American Architect Frank Lloyd Wright.  Mr. Smith narrated the journey on the Chicago Architecture Foundation&apos;s (CAF&apos;s) round trip bus tour to visit the Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio and the Unity Temple in Oak Park, Illinois.  

At the beginning of the journey Mr. Smith pointed out various architectural highlights of Chicago until the bus reached the expressway at which point he provided an historical overview of architect Frank Lloyd Wright-his life and legacy...both personal and professional....I especially enjoyed Mr. Smith&apos;s peppering of books about architecture and Frank Lloyd Wright...i.e.

&quot;Loving Frank&quot; by Nancy Horan about Mr. Wright&apos;s illicit love affair with Mamah Northwick at the beginning of the 20th Century;

&quot;The Women&quot; by T.C. Boyle -voiced from the perspectives of the four main women in Mr. Wright&apos;s Life;

&quot;The Seven Lamps of Architecture&quot; by John Ruskin which examines the influence of nature on architecture;

and &quot;The Blocks of Venice&quot; which was referenced but I could not find....on-line?  Someone throw me a bone aka message...if you know..

Like a true academic and retired professor he introduced terminology and trademarks which were important in understanding and identifying the unique architectural features exhibited in Mr. Wright&apos;s buildings such as:

1.  &quot;Light Screens&quot;=Windows allowing the natural world into the structures
2.  Compress and Release...from small narrow spaces which lead to open large spaces
3.  The Journey of Discovery&quot;....the unique entryway to each structure is located on the side of most buildings
4.  The influence of Japanese Art (Block Prints-Hokusai) on Mr. Wright&apos;s thinking and constructs

...these are just a few...

The tour alone on the bus was unique, captivating, and provided inspiring insight by an academic (retired professor) and CAF Docent who really enjoys the subject matter and shares it in a lively way with his audience (us!).  The CAF...is very, very lucky to have Retired Professor David Smith as a Docent- as are all participants who have the opportunity to obtain a ticket for this tour and learn about the architect Frank Lloyd Wright.  

Thank you for a wonderful experience as my parents were visiting from the East Coast of The United States and had limited time with me...we all agreed it was one of the highlights of the trip that we will always have to share and remember our time together or explore and discuss through your reading recommendations!  

Mr. Smith is indeed an &quot;exceptional&quot; Docent!

5,"This tour was absolutely fantastic. After living in Chicago for 20 years, I&apos;m not sure why during this pandemic I decided it was time to take the tour, but wow am I happy I did! We came on a Saturday afternoon and the boat looked socially- distanced full. Chairs were spaced far apart and there was plenty of space between. Our guide was very knowledgeable and provided lots of fun tidbits of Chicago history along with all the architectural information. The tour was just the right length (about 90 minutes). It was cold and windy on the top of the boat but still the tour was very enjoyable. Pricing at ~$50 seems a little steep for a group tour, but in the end I was very happy we did this."
5,"On Friday noon I stopped by the Architectural Center for its exhibits. For a $12 admission I entered into its 3 exhibits - a rotating gallery, the skyscraper gallery, and the Chicago gallery.

The rotating gallery featured multiple wall displays about designing cities for the 21st century, taking into consideration sustainability, greenery, and post-automobile transit. The exhibit, as a guest exhibit, was the smallest, providing ~10-15 minutes of reading.

The second exhibit, the skyscraper gallery, featured many replica models of skyscrapers and their descriptions. Icons such as the Sears Tower made an appearance. Additionally, the gallery showcased design considerations, such as mass dampers to counteract building sway due to high winds and the evolution of structural reinforcement.

The third exhibit, the Chicago gallery, traces the city&apos;s architectural evolution of not only high rises, but also smaller, single-family swellings. Moreover, it has a scale model of the city itself for a neat bird&apos;s eye view.

In all, this entertained me for an hour, and I got to learn about an iconic American city!"
4,"I visited the exhibits that are housed on-site.  I&apos;ve heard great things about their tours, but I haven&apos;t ever been on one. I have an interest in architecture after spending a couple of years working for one of the Frank Lloyd Wright organizations, so prior to this, most of my time enjoying architecture is self-planned wandering.  

The admission price seems about right for the size of the place ($12 general, $8 students). 

The exhibits were neat. One of them was on skyscrapers and the other was the scale model of a portion of the city.  The facts about the various city buildings were fascinating to me!  The larger-scale photos of planned buildings held my attention.  I&apos;m excited to see how the city continues to evolve as time goes on.  

So, I probably won&apos;t go back unless if I&apos;m bringing guests from out of town. I think the Architecture Center itself is definitely worth at least one visit for locals or tourists alike."
5,"We toured the Chicago Architecture Center during Open House Chicago and it was a fantastic experience! Although they offer a wide variety of architectural tours all over the city, their building itself is a treasure not to be missed. They sell Chicago merchandise and schedule tours out of this space so it&apos;s also open to the public.

The first floor holds a room sized model of the entire city of Chicago. It is absolutely unbelievable! We watched a movie there that highlights much of the city&apos;s history and architecture. One of the most dramatic parts was the highlighting (in orange flame looking lighting) of the entire area the Chicago fire engulfed. The sheer scope of the area destroyed really stuck with me. 

The 2nd floor holds models of some of the most iconic skyscrapers and new innovative architectural designs around the world. It&apos;s great fun and very educational to explore. 

The Chicago Architecture Center is true gem the heart of downtown Chicago!"
5,"The new and improved Chicago Architecture Center moved from its old spot across from the Art Institute to its location on Wacker Drive along the Chicago River.  Although there is now an entrance fee, you can experience a multimedia show that centers upon a wonderful model of downtown Chicago and its plethora of architectural towers and landmarks.  The upper level features some very cool models and descriptions of architecturally significant skyscrapers.  The gift shop is still a fun place to look for Chicago and architecture-related gifts, and this is the launching point for many of the popular walking tours.  Definitely check out the Chicago Architecture Center if you are a fan of the world-renowned architecture to be discovered in Chicago."
5,I love the model buildings upstairs. A lot of time was spent on the details of the exhibits and I am happy I stopped in.
3,"The museum was good, the front desk staff was catatonic.
I became a member this week to support the organization and made a visit to the center on Friday, July 31.  It was at 10am and no guests were there except us.  Neither front desk employees greeted us, one just blankly stared and the other looked away, so I chose him. The exchange we had to get into the museum was so unwelcoming and difficult that I expect tourists must have negative perception of Chicago after a visit - not what I would expect for a &quot;gateway center.&quot;  Luckily, an employee on the third floor was engaging and informative about the buildings and architects.  Overall the museum is well planned and worth a trip. Probably will not renew membership."
5,"I was born and raised here in Chicago. I feel so ashamed that I never visited CAC. I had to pick up my volunteer packet for the upcoming Open House Chicago. The first location for the volunteers to pick up their packet was here at CAC. The location area gives you a nice beautiful view of some of the historic buildings here in Chicago. 

The Skyscraper Gallery on the second floor is worth seeing. There are so many exhibits and displays to enjoy and learn the history of the architecture in Chicago.

After you take a tour there is a store on the main floor with many cool things to purchase.  The staff was very friendly with plenty of smiles ready to help in anyway. This is just not a place for tourist. It&apos;s for anyone and any age to enjoy and learn about the history and enjoy the beautiful architectural of our great city."
5,Needed to kill some time &amp; the CAC was right across the street from our hotel so we decided to visit. Tickets were $12 to view the exhibit. We were literally the only ones there besides the workers but never were we feel like we were being followed around. They have a large 3D model of the city which lights up certain buildings if you press the buttons on the screen. I love interactivity! Very interesting place to read up on Chicago&apos;s architecture.
3,"This review is based on the center, itself, and not on any of their tours.

A friend and I decided to check out the relatively new center off of Michigan Avenue.   The center has three levels....the first is the retail which offers many &quot;Chicago theme&quot; its such as games, magnets, t-shirts/ hoodies to name a few.  The items were priced more on the higher side.

The main level offers the desk for the various tours and special exhibits.  When we were there, the O&apos;Hare Airport expansion exhibition was there.  

One the third level, are scaled high rise buildings that are located in Chicago and many throughout the world.  I thought, they would have more exhibits on the city than they had.

I really don&apos;t think I would return to the center unless I reserve one of their tours."
3,"I was visiting Chicago this past weekend with some family and friends. We had taken CAC&apos;s architecture boat tour which included admission to the CAC. Two of our party rushed to get to a Cubs game, but my friend and I decided to check the CAC out since we&apos;d technically already paid for it. It&apos;s small, but it&apos;s worth running into if you have a few minutes. They have a pretty cool model of Chicago&apos;s downtown Loop and some models of skyscrapers with information about them. It&apos;s not a lot, but if you&apos;re getting in for free like we did, check it out! They also have a very nice gift shop. It&apos;s very small, but I&apos;m glad we stopped in for a few minutes."
4,"Took the Golden Age Tour and really enjoyed it. Tour guide Ericka is wonderful! Front desk ticket sales dude could lighten up a bit. Life isn&apos;t death. 
Great tour!"
5,"Whether or not you consider yourself an architectural aficionado, this museum/center/foundation is a must, if you live in Chicago or are visiting the city.  Chicago is the architectural beacon for the world.  The skyline, the buildings, the urban scape, is without a rival, in my immodest opinion.  

The center provides a historical, economic, and lifestyle context for the fabulous architecture that surrounds you in &quot;the city of big shoulders.&quot; The tours provided by the foundation are amazing.  Even with my uncontrollable A.D.D., I was devouring every word from my engaging and intellectually knowledgeable docent John.  I think I know everything, as evidenced by my arrogant reviews.  However, I received an education from John that no school has been able to provide, and I went to some good ones. 

I am hoping to take a different tour each day I&apos;m in Chicago.  It was that good.  The museum itself is designed well, as expected from an architecturally based foundation.  There are highlights, such as the model city, but everything, including the gift shop, was worthwhile and interesting.

Hey, I&apos;m not a museum/class/tour kind of person.  Between my A.D.D. and need to be the center of attention at all times, I have an extinction rate of about 10 minutes.  But I loved everything about both the tour and the museum.  Tomorrow, I hope to take the architectural river cruise.  I want to thank the Chicago Architectural Center for providing a great service, not only for Chicago, but for every visitor.  Bravo!"
4,"Bottom Line:  A nice gift, book and souvenir store emphasizing Chicago and architecture. You can book tours here too.

The Chicago Architecture Foundation may be best known for their river cruises but they also have a nice store on Michigan Avenue and they offer other tours too. The store is very tasteful and you can get momentos of Chicago as well as items that play homage to architecture.  They offer books, lego sets and Frank Lloyd Wright decor among many other quality items.  I enjoyed looking at the Chicago artwork as well as the toys.  You will not find cheesy souvenirs here."
5,"I now love Chicago! The tours were the best! We did the bust tour through neighborhoods in Chicago. The guide was awesome! We did the riverboat tour to , on a rainy day! It was still awesome! And yes we did Frank Lloyd Wright tours too... 2 of them on Oak Park! It was the best. My only regret was I didn&apos;t go toWrigley Field....but next time! Oh and the Museum and gift shop were great!! Do not miss it!"
5,"02/28/18 Leap Year Yelp had an open invitation at The Chicago Architectural Foundation (CAF) to address 7 buildings + 1 that are in danger of being replaced.  I think I was the lone Yelp representative at this event. (I know Luai tried, but was told the event was full). 

All of the buildings have some historic significance and to see them removed would be tragic.  I know about progress and the constantly evolving landscape, but a few of the structures are very significant like Union Station (open in 1925) w/it&apos;s Great Hall.  Union Stations Great Hall is a magnificent space, it would be trulto see something of such historic significance removed from the urban landscape.  

The State Illinois Building?  I can&apos;t believe they are even considering removing this building, but unfortunately the State with its financial woes have allowed this building fall into serious disrepair.  This building has a very impressive 17 story atrium surrounded by offices around the perimeter.

I remember this block before The State of Illinois Building was built.  The old Greyhound Bus Station use to be there along with The Double RR where Joel Daley (channel 7 news anchor) &amp; The sundowners use to play country music.  I know this is going to date me, but how many of you remember Fahey Flynn &amp; Joel Daley.

The Chicago Architectural Foundation is located in The Railway Exchange Building @ 224 S. Michigan Ave.  designed by Daniel Burnham.  Inside there is a model of Chicago 

There is a scale model of Chicago from North Michigan Ave to Soldier Field to the south.  Lake Michigan on the east to west of the Chicago River.  There is also an interactive computer monitor that students were using along with designs of buildings hanging from a rail around the perimeter of the space. M"

As of early 2019 the move is done and the new place is beautiful! Besides the original model that is much expanded, there are now several very large scale models of tall structures from around the world, all built 91:1 scale as I recall.

Be sure to watch the short movie by the city model. I found it very informative in spite of having watched numerous channel 11 PBS documentaries about Chicago architecture.

4,"Bottom Line:  A nice gift, book and souvenir store emphasizing Chicago and architecture. You can book tours here too.

The Chicago Architecture Foundation may be best known for their river cruises but they also have a nice store on Michigan Avenue and they offer other tours too. The store is very tasteful and you can get momentos of Chicago as well as items that play homage to architecture.  They offer books, lego sets and Frank Lloyd Wright decor among many other quality items.  I enjoyed looking at the Chicago artwork as well as the toys.  You will not find cheesy souvenirs here."
5,"I now love Chicago! The tours were the best! We did the bust tour through neighborhoods in Chicago. The guide was awesome! We did the riverboat tour to , on a rainy day! It was still awesome! And yes we did Frank Lloyd Wright tours too... 2 of them on Oak Park! It was the best. My only regret was I didn&apos;t go toWrigley Field....but next time! Oh and the Museum and gift shop were great!! Do not miss it!"
5,"02/28/18 Leap Year Yelp had an open invitation at The Chicago Architectural Foundation (CAF) to address 7 buildings + 1 that are in danger of being replaced.  I think I was the lone Yelp representative at this event. (I know Luai tried, but was told the event was full). 

All of the buildings have some historic significance and to see them removed would be tragic.  I know about progress and the constantly evolving landscape, but a few of the structures are very significant like Union Station (open in 1925) w/it&apos;s Great Hall.  Union Stations Great Hall is a magnificent space, it would be trulto see something of such historic significance removed from the urban landscape.  

The State Illinois Building?  I can&apos;t believe they are even considering removing this building, but unfortunately the State with its financial woes have allowed this building fall into serious disrepair.  This building has a very impressive 17 story atrium surrounded by offices around the perimeter.

I remember this block before The State of Illinois Building was built.  The old Greyhound Bus Station use to be there along with The Double RR where Joel Daley (channel 7 news anchor) &amp; The sundowners use to play country music.  I know this is going to date me, but how many of you remember Fahey Flynn &amp; Joel Daley.

The Chicago Architectural Foundation is located in The Railway Exchange Building @ 224 S. Michigan Ave.  designed by Daniel Burnham.  Inside there is a model of Chicago 

There is a scale model of Chicago from North Michigan Ave to Soldier Field to the south.  Lake Michigan on the east to west of the Chicago River.  There is also an interactive computer monitor that students were using along with designs of buildings hanging from a rail around the perimeter of the space. M"
5,"Updated review:
As of early 2019 the move is done and the new place is beautiful! Besides the original model that is much expanded, there are now several very large scale models of tall structures from around the world, all built 91:1 scale as I recall.

Be sure to watch the short movie by the city model. I found it very informative in spite of having watched numerous channel 11 PBS documentaries about Chicago architecture.

Full ADA wheelchair accessibility inside and out too. Thanks!

Original review:
On 3/20/2018 the Chicago model is moving to 111 E. Wacker Dr. (see pic of sign)  Other photos also show the new location is now being remodeled and an artist rendering of the future finished product.

This model has always been GREAT.  I can&apos;t wait to see the NEW and IMPROVED model!"
5,"Along with a new name, the CAC (formerly the Chicago Architecture Foundation) moved to a prominent riverfront location.  

On the first floor you&apos;ll learn about visionary architects and city planners who shaped our city and gave it its distinctive skyline; explore five Chicago neighborhoods through an architectural lens, and get a bird&apos;s-eye view of Chicago&apos;s 234 square miles via a giant color-coded map. The highlight is the &apos;Chicago City Model Experience&apos;, which tells unique stories via video and interactive touch screens. 

The second floor of the museum has scale models (one of which is is 38 feet tall!) of five iconic high-rises around the world. Other smaller models which display famous skyscrapers are also featured (including ones that were proposed but never built), and has a rotating gallery with exhibits that change depending on current and future projects.

Full disclosure: my firm designed the new-and-improved CAC, and is featured prominently throughout the center, but company pride aside, I still think this is a terrific and educational place to go. I can&apos;t even begin to describe what it&apos;s like to see these models in person; you really get an unrivaled sense of what these larger-than-life buildings are like in real life that can&apos;t be duplicated by photos or videos, which is of course why these models are built.

This is also a place to purchase tickets to one of their many wonderful tours of and around Chicago. (Being on one of the tours gets you discounted or free admission to the CAC.)

The gift shop is also noteworthy, and rivals any modern art museum&apos;s. You&apos;ll find great Chicago-centric gifts and trinkets for architectural junkies, souvenirs, or anyone who&apos;s a fan of Chicago or its architecture.

Definitely a worthwhile place to check out whether you&apos;re an architecture enthusiast or a casual admirer."
5,"I was here for the first time and brought my 9 year old son.  He is into maps and the buildings of Chicago...  he could not get enough of this place.

A big interactive model, a short movie, and into about the history of Chicago.  They also have a gallery devoted to the rest of the world&apos;s tallest buildings as well.

We got in for $5 after going on the associated architecture river tour.  I highly recommend the combination."
5,"This review is for Docent David Smith who is perfect to lead the commentary (as he is a retired Professor and Seasoned Docent) on American Architect Frank Lloyd Wright.  Mr. Smith narrated the journey on the Chicago Architecture Foundation&apos;s (CAF&apos;s) round trip bus tour to visit the Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio and the Unity Temple in Oak Park, Illinois.  

At the beginning of the journey Mr. Smith pointed out various architectural highlights of Chicago until the bus reached the expressway at which point he provided an historical overview of architect Frank Lloyd Wright-his life and legacy...both personal and professional....I especially enjoyed Mr. Smith&apos;s peppering of books about architecture and Frank Lloyd Wright...i.e.

&quot;Loving Frank&quot; by Nancy Horan about Mr. Wright&apos;s illicit love affair with Mamah Northwick at the beginning of the 20th Century;

&quot;The Women&quot; by T.C. Boyle -voiced from the perspectives of the four main women in Mr. Wright&apos;s Life;

&quot;The Seven Lamps of Architecture&quot; by John Ruskin which examines the influence of nature on architecture;

and &quot;The Blocks of Venice&quot; which was referenced but I could not find....on-line?  Someone throw me a bone aka message...if you know..

Like a true academic and retired professor he introduced terminology and trademarks which were important in understanding and identifying the unique architectural features exhibited in Mr. Wright&apos;s buildings such as:

1.  &quot;Light Screens&quot;=Windows allowing the natural world into the structures
2.  Compress and Release...from small narrow spaces which lead to open large spaces
3.  The Journey of Discovery&quot;....the unique entryway to each structure is located on the side of most buildings
4.  The influence of Japanese Art (Block Prints-Hokusai) on Mr. Wright&apos;s thinking and constructs

...these are just a few...

The tour alone on the bus was unique, captivating, and provided inspiring insight by an academic (retired professor) and CAF Docent who really enjoys the subject matter and shares it in a lively way with his audience (us!).  The CAF...is very, very lucky to have Retired Professor David Smith as a Docent- as are all participants who have the opportunity to obtain a ticket for this tour and learn about the architect Frank Lloyd Wright.  

Thank you for a wonderful experience as my parents were visiting from the East Coast of The United States and had limited time with me...we all agreed it was one of the highlights of the trip that we will always have to share and remember our time together or explore and discuss through your reading recommendations!  

Mr. Smith is indeed an &quot;exceptional&quot; Docent!
