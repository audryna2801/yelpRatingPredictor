5,"My wife and I got a well earned getaway weekend for our 10th anniversary! We decided to check out a new place we&apos;d never been to before. I had heard from several others that this place was outstanding so we decided to make a reservation for 6pm on their patio.

They offered patio or indoor seating and with the current COVID-19 Protocols we felt better about being outside. We felt very comfortable as we sat under their heat lamps and had a nice romantic dinner.

We started with their bread, which was about $9. I&apos;d say it&apos;s on the better end of the spectrum but certainly not worth the money. I mean, it&apos;s bread! 

Next we had the apple salad which was outstanding. I&apos;m not a huge apple fan but their salad blended sweet with spicy and was just the best. Then we ordered scallops and pork belly and were mesmerized by both. We decided to share everything and didn&apos;t regret it as we enjoyed every single dish they brought out. 

I would highly recommend this place to those seeking a &quot;close to normal&quot; dining experience!"
5,"If Covid&apos;s got you down and you want an excellent date night out with perfect food &amp; beverage, this is THE spot. Safe &amp; socially distant, and the menu is outstanding. They execute to perfection.

Since I&apos;m thorough, below is what we had:

Two kinds of west coast oysters I&apos;ve never had from Samich Bay, Washington: Samich Pearl (left) and Penn Cove (right). These are both third best in my mind next to Kumamotos and Kusshis. Loved em! 

Steak tartare with some seriously amazing *perfect* seeded rye bread, fresno chili dijonaise and fried shallot.

Midwestern cheese plate with fresh chevre, brie, and an ash rind gooey cheese, fennel roasted candied cashews, apricot preserves, and sweet cherries.

Not pictured, a lovely glass of Spanish cava paired with the oysters and a glass of French bordeaux just because. Plus, my hubby&apos;s Westmalle Dubbel beer which was on draft. The place has an extensive Belgian beer list, a well curated wine list, and pretty cocktails. 

I think the intention there is to go there and stuff yourself full of fresh baked bread, meat, and Belgian beer, but really I felt myself being drawn toward the vegetarian dishes. They looked stellar. Next time!

Keep up the good work Publican, your servers are doing a phenomenal job!"
5,"*pre covid review* 

Hands down one of the best brunch places in the city. Their food is just great. If you are open to trying something new but that still feels like comfort food and is delicious then this is the spot. We usually come here for brunch and it is never repetitive. Their menu has a few staples (like their mouth watering, thick, and tender bacon) that don&apos;t change much and then their main dishes which rotate and change. I love that because it means that you are forced to try something different every time. It seems risky on their end but it allows them to remain creative with new dishes and I appreciate that. 
Aside from the amazing food, the staff is great and always attentive. They take reservations which is another reason why I love them but they do book up fairly quickly for brunch some times. 

Overall I love Publican and I highly recommend coming here for brunch or dinner!"
3,"Maybe it was because I came here for brunch but I had very high expectations for this place. Due to Covid, we reserved the prepaid seating in the outdoor igloos and had trouble ordering enough to fulfill the $50 each minimum. Each main dish was ~$15. We ordered the chicken and dumpling, publican scramble (spinach, crema, and crispy shallots), and the pork belly hash. All the food were a little too salty and fatty for my taste but the portions were decent. 

While the food was not very impressive, the drinks were delicious! The bourbon cream coffee and the pear hot toddy hit the spot especially on a cold morning dining outdoors. 

The service was a little a confusion. The waitstaff seemed to be in a rush, perhaps due to the pre-paid outdoor dining time limit and constantly checked to see if we were done with our food. 

However, I have heard good things about its dinner options and willing to try again!"
3,"First time here and first time doing the prepaid seating and our experience has been terrible so far. I understand there&apos;s a pandemic but that shouldn&apos;t be an excuse for a &quot;high end&quot; restaurant. They couldn&apos;t find our prepaid $45 reservations and they don&apos;t have 70% of the menu. We weren&apos;t told this until after we already sat down. I had 4 choices to pick from prior to my arrival and they don&apos;t have every single one of them. We had to rush to order and was completely off guard by the lack of choices. I heard raving reviews of this place and always wanted to give it a try. I support my local restaurants and businesses and this is not a good representation. I only have it 2 stars since they were somewhat accommodating to not being able to find our prepaid reservation and the mask policy is strictly enforced. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star.

Update: the server and manager were apologetic about our experience. Therefore, I upped it another star."
4,"Went for Sunday brunch on 11/22 in the igloos. Great staff, I mean stellar, excellent people. They provided recommendations, knew the menu (super important), and were honest - just down right awesome service. I was not a fan of the hash browns though. The menu literally says &quot;hash browns&quot; but they are deep fried in butter and they were very crispy like hard(maybe some people like that).  

The domes are not heated I would suggest dressing warm, and there is metered parking in walking distance. I loved the new branada toast (it&apos;s not avocado toast although it looks like it on Instagram). The chicken and dumplings were good, skillet looked good really can&apos;t go wrong."
5,"Had a fantastic experience at publican. Beer and wine list is so well rounded, truly something for everyone. We had the scallops, bread and fish dip, oysters, bbq carrots and charc plate. Everything was FANTASTIC! My fiancé a little bummed because ham plate was taken off of menu."
4,"Outdoor seating with translucent pods is a thing and it looks cool. This block of Fulton St is lined with them and you need to have your selfie taken here. 

The publican does comfort food right. By it self the dishes were fine taken as a whole, they take it up a notch. 

The farm chicken with au jus on a bed of French fries is having not only a savory and well seasoned bird but is like having poutine at the same time. The side sausage is good counter to the richness of the bird. By the way the dark meat is absolutely delicious.

The BBQ carrot tasted like meat carrot. It did not taste like a vegetable. Our server suggested the mussels which my wife and son really liked. The bread it came with was excellent. 

Fulton is now bougie - that comes with prices to match just be aware of that when you dine here."
4,"The Publican is a must visit in Chicago for brunch! And during COVID and indoor dining shutdown, they offer outdoor tent dining or individual bubble/ house dining (requires $150 deposit which is non-refundable and is applied towards your restaurant bill.) -- We did the tent and we&apos;re plenty warm. You can make reservations online, but we were able to get a table on Sunday in 45° weather without a reservation. The service was good and the food was delicious! I ordered a bourbon cream coffee which was a bit too bourbony for me, but I think bourbon lovers would go nuts for this! -- Will definitely be back to try more dishes!"
3,"We ate in one of the igloos- &quot;private domes&quot;- they are not heated. The reservation system says &quot;dine without the elements.&quot; You are in the elements when it is cold out, the description is quite misleading. The igloos also have an open flap which also lets a lot of heat escape. 
This should also be made clear when making a reservation and paying a non refundable $200 deposit. Overall food was great, naturally got cold fast but the courses were well spaced. The service was a bit slow especially for how few tables there were."
1,"Terrible service.No hospitality.
We booked the weekend brunch and when we arrived we had to wait a lot until seated then waited again for the order...and again when checking out.our server was cold and showed no hospitality.
There was a lot of trashes around our outdoor seating.
Very, very unpleasant.
Our server told us that  waffle and schnitzel were unavailable, at the timing of ordering , but he should have informed us before...
And food was also average, blunt, no surprise.
Just very much pricey for their portion.
And they charged us full price though we already put $30 in advance , when we booked online...so we had to ask the server to correct it.
Never come back."
5,"Let&apos;s shine a spotlight on another restaurant that has been truly amazing during the pandemic. 

First, the food is great, even if you don&apos;t order pork. The roast chicken is delicious, with a nicely salty sauce that goes perfectly on their fries, and the sides are interesting, textured, satisfying, and creative. I&apos;m thinking of the bbq carrots with ranch sauce, the burrata with tons of veggies, etc. And the desserts - an important and tough test in my household - are superlative. 

Second, they deliver! To Hyde Park! I don&apos;t mind doing some curbside pickup when I have to, but with little kids at home and Chicago traffic being what it is, I award a huge premium to any place that will give me 30-60 minutes of my life back by delivering to my door. Down here in the ivory tower we don&apos;t have a ton of amazing delivery options. But Publican is one of them.

Third, the customer service goes above and beyond. We had planned out a great spread for a Friday night dinner. The spread arrived, but missing our roast chicken. Hamlet without the prince and all that. Many restaurants would have just apologized and refunded the chicken. But the Publican recognized that without the chicken, dinner was ruined. They rushed the chicken through the kitchen and packed it into an Uber Connect. It arrived before we were done with the first course, and saved the day. And on top of that, they added a loaf of the best Publican bread for free. And they STILL refunded the chicken. 

When I worry about whether the Chicago restaurant scene will survive the pandemic, I think: as long as places like the Publican survive, we will be ok."
4,"Great local food on the main drag on Fulton&apos;s restaurant row. They offer &quot;greenhouse&quot; private dining pods outside with a min. Purchase deposit, which we found quite nice and intimate and well as safe from COVID. Food is to be shared amongst guests and doesn&apos;t come out as a meal but more like tapas. We tried the homemade bread, mussels, shrimp, and scallops- all with lots of fresh herbs and tons of flavor."
4,"We had a really great time here. Beer was great, oysters were great, the bread and dip trio was great! The pork belly for me was just OK and the service also seemed a tiny bit lacking, but overall super glad we decided to make reservations here."
5,"Gotta call in advance and reserve you spot. Decided to check this place out after watching this show called , F*ck that&apos;s delicious, and oh my it really is !!!! We ordered the soft shell crab, oysters and pork belly and frites. That was enough for 2 people. Ambience was nice on a busy Friday night During the pandemic.. but they were extra careful and did what they need to do to make sure everyone stays safe. Really love the food here and can&apos;t wait to come back."
4,"This place is not cheap, but it is ideal for special occasions. 

We started with oysters and a cheese plate, which set the tone for my excellent scallops."
5,"Loved having brunch here! 
Their Covid precautions were well organized and clean. 

The food was amazing! The pork belly was so crispy, chewy, and flavorful. The Biscuit Sandwich with Flank Steak was also a great meal that hit the spot. The different ingredients and condiments in the sandwich complimented each other so well! My favorite was the Belgian waffle. It was so light and crispy, yet was still chewy and so delicious. The jam and butter that came with it was also the perfect complement to the syrup!

Definitely want to come again next time I&apos;m in town!"
5,"Delicious authentic Southern food from New Orleans in Chicago at the Publican. The cute, cozy, and safe dining experience in their private greenhouses. Make sure to dress warm and enjoy the experience."
5,"The ambience at The Publican is great for groups. I highly recommend making a reservation. They have communal seating so go in with the expectation that you might be seated at a table with strangers, but take advantage of it and have fun! I personally recommend the communal seating for large groups; for dates, request a booth for some more privacy and intimacy.

Dishes are family style, so I recommend ordering two dishes per person. I honestly enjoyed every dish that I ordered. The potted rillettes were my favourite. There was a great balance of savouriness and sweetness. The sourdough bread was smokey and had the right crispiness, adding texture to the dish.
The honeycrisp apple tartine was refreshing. It had a nice level of acidity that cut through the richness of another dish, the pork shank, that I had. The pork shank was tender. The sauce/jus was delicious with thin slices of mango in it.

I highly recommend The Publican. I would gladly come back to try some other dishes on the menu. I also look forward to going to another restaurant by Paul Kahan."
4,"Great food but VERY pricey for the portion sizes you get. The plates are meant to be shared between a few people but in my opinion, it was more like a plate for one (maybe I just eat too much). My boyfriend took me here for dinner and we enjoyed everything. The restaurant is very family style in terms of seating, which makes the place feel homey and welcoming. There are giant pig paintings on the walls. 

Our service was wonderful. Our waters got refilled very quickly, our plates and utensils got switched out after every plate, we got checked up on often, and when one of us went to the bathroom, our napkin would get refolded and placed nicely by the staff. 

We started out with the chef selection of oysters (6/$18). They came out with a little sheet that explained where they were from and their taste. My favorite are earthy west coast oysters. 

For shareable plates, we ordered the hamachi crudo, pork belly, and sirloin. The pork belly was so tender that you aren&apos;t even given a knife to cut it. It was amazing and melt in your mouth. If you don&apos;t like fatty pork belly, you will probably not like this. The hamachi crudo was very fresh, the calamansi vinegar gave it a nice kick. The dry aged sirloin was also quite good with the cashew butter. 

We finished off with some mead and goat/sheep cheese platter. I&apos;ll be coming back to try the brunch next time."

3,"First time here and first time doing the prepaid seating and our experience has been terrible so far. I understand there&apos;s a pandemic but that shouldn&apos;t be an excuse for a &quot;high end&quot; restaurant. They couldn&apos;t find our prepaid $45 reservations and they don&apos;t have 70% of the menu. We weren&apos;t told this until after we already sat down. I had 4 choices to pick from prior to my arrival and they don&apos;t have every single one of them. We had to rush to order and was completely off guard by the lack of choices. I heard raving reviews of this place and always wanted to give it a try. I support my local restaurants and businesses and this is not a good representation. I only have it 2 stars since they were somewhat accommodating to not being able to find our prepaid reservation and the mask policy is strictly enforced. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star.

Update: the server and manager were apologetic about our experience. Therefore, I upped it another star."
4,"Went for Sunday brunch on 11/22 in the igloos. Great staff, I mean stellar, excellent people. They provided recommendations, knew the menu (super important), and were honest - just down right awesome service. I was not a fan of the hash browns though. The menu literally says &quot;hash browns&quot; but they are deep fried in butter and they were very crispy like hard(maybe some people like that).  

The domes are not heated I would suggest dressing warm, and there is metered parking in walking distance. I loved the new branada toast (it&apos;s not avocado toast although it looks like it on Instagram). The chicken and dumplings were good, skillet looked good really can&apos;t go wrong."
5,"Had a fantastic experience at publican. Beer and wine list is so well rounded, truly something for everyone. We had the scallops, bread and fish dip, oysters, bbq carrots and charc plate. Everything was FANTASTIC! My fiancé a little bummed because ham plate was taken off of menu."
4,"Outdoor seating with translucent pods is a thing and it looks cool. This block of Fulton St is lined with them and you need to have your selfie taken here. 

The publican does comfort food right. By it self the dishes were fine taken as a whole, they take it up a notch. 

The farm chicken with au jus on a bed of French fries is having not only a savory and well seasoned bird but is like having poutine at the same time. The side sausage is good counter to the richness of the bird. By the way the dark meat is absolutely delicious.

The BBQ carrot tasted like meat carrot. It did not taste like a vegetable. Our server suggested the mussels which my wife and son really liked. The bread it came with was excellent. 

Fulton is now bougie - that comes with prices to match just be aware of that when you dine here."
4,"The Publican is a must visit in Chicago for brunch! And during COVID and indoor dining shutdown, they offer outdoor tent dining or individual bubble/ house dining (requires $150 deposit which is non-refundable and is applied towards your restaurant bill.) -- We did the tent and we&apos;re plenty warm. You can make reservations online, but we were able to get a table on Sunday in 45° weather without a reservation. The service was good and the food was delicious! I ordered a bourbon cream coffee which was a bit too bourbony for me, but I think bourbon lovers would go nuts for this! -- Will definitely be back to try more dishes!"
3,"We ate in one of the igloos- &quot;private domes&quot;- they are not heated. The reservation system says &quot;dine without the elements.&quot; You are in the elements when it is cold out, the description is quite misleading. The igloos also have an open flap which also lets a lot of heat escape. 
This should also be made clear when making a reservation and paying a non refundable $200 deposit. Overall food was great, naturally got cold fast but the courses were well spaced. The service was a bit slow especially for how few tables there were."
1,"Terrible service.No hospitality.
We booked the weekend brunch and when we arrived we had to wait a lot until seated then waited again for the order...and again when checking out.our server was cold and showed no hospitality.
There was a lot of trashes around our outdoor seating.
Very, very unpleasant.
Our server told us that  waffle and schnitzel were unavailable, at the timing of ordering , but he should have informed us before...
And food was also average, blunt, no surprise.
Just very much pricey for their portion.
And they charged us full price though we already put $30 in advance , when we booked online...so we had to ask the server to correct it.
Never come back."
5,"Let&apos;s shine a spotlight on another restaurant that has been truly amazing during the pandemic. 

First, the food is great, even if you don&apos;t order pork. The roast chicken is delicious, with a nicely salty sauce that goes perfectly on their fries, and the sides are interesting, textured, satisfying, and creative. I&apos;m thinking of the bbq carrots with ranch sauce, the burrata with tons of veggies, etc. And the desserts - an important and tough test in my household - are superlative. 

Second, they deliver! To Hyde Park! I don&apos;t mind doing some curbside pickup when I have to, but with little kids at home and Chicago traffic being what it is, I award a huge premium to any place that will give me 30-60 minutes of my life back by delivering to my door. Down here in the ivory tower we don&apos;t have a ton of amazing delivery options. But Publican is one of them.

Third, the customer service goes above and beyond. We had planned out a great spread for a Friday night dinner. The spread arrived, but missing our roast chicken. Hamlet without the prince and all that. Many restaurants would have just apologized and refunded the chicken. But the Publican recognized that without the chicken, dinner was ruined. They rushed the chicken through the kitchen and packed it into an Uber Connect. It arrived before we were done with the first course, and saved the day. And on top of that, they added a loaf of the best Publican bread for free. And they STILL refunded the chicken. 

When I worry about whether the Chicago restaurant scene will survive the pandemic, I think: as long as places like the Publican survive, we will be ok."
4,"Great local food on the main drag on Fulton&apos;s restaurant row. They offer &quot;greenhouse&quot; private dining pods outside with a min. Purchase deposit, which we found quite nice and intimate and well as safe from COVID. Food is to be shared amongst guests and doesn&apos;t come out as a meal but more like tapas. We tried the homemade bread, mussels, shrimp, and scallops- all with lots of fresh herbs and tons of flavor."
4,"We had a really great time here. Beer was great, oysters were great, the bread and dip trio was great! The pork belly for me was just OK and the service also seemed a tiny bit lacking, but overall super glad we decided to make reservations here."
5,"Gotta call in advance and reserve you spot. Decided to check this place out after watching this show called , F*ck that&apos;s delicious, and oh my it really is !!!! We ordered the soft shell crab, oysters and pork belly and frites. That was enough for 2 people. Ambience was nice on a busy Friday night During the pandemic.. but they were extra careful and did what they need to do to make sure everyone stays safe. Really love the food here and can&apos;t wait to come back."
4,"This place is not cheap, but it is ideal for special occasions. 

We started with oysters and a cheese plate, which set the tone for my excellent scallops."
5,"Loved having brunch here! 
Their Covid precautions were well organized and clean. 

The food was amazing! The pork belly was so crispy, chewy, and flavorful. The Biscuit Sandwich with Flank Steak was also a great meal that hit the spot. The different ingredients and condiments in the sandwich complimented each other so well! My favorite was the Belgian waffle. It was so light and crispy, yet was still chewy and so delicious. The jam and butter that came with it was also the perfect complement to the syrup!

Definitely want to come again next time I&apos;m in town!"
5,"Delicious authentic Southern food from New Orleans in Chicago at the Publican. The cute, cozy, and safe dining experience in their private greenhouses. Make sure to dress warm and enjoy the experience."
5,"The ambience at The Publican is great for groups. I highly recommend making a reservation. They have communal seating so go in with the expectation that you might be seated at a table with strangers, but take advantage of it and have fun! I personally recommend the communal seating for large groups; for dates, request a booth for some more privacy and intimacy.

Dishes are family style, so I recommend ordering two dishes per person. I honestly enjoyed every dish that I ordered. The potted rillettes were my favourite. There was a great balance of savouriness and sweetness. The sourdough bread was smokey and had the right crispiness, adding texture to the dish.
The honeycrisp apple tartine was refreshing. It had a nice level of acidity that cut through the richness of another dish, the pork shank, that I had. The pork shank was tender. The sauce/jus was delicious with thin slices of mango in it.

I highly recommend The Publican. I would gladly come back to try some other dishes on the menu. I also look forward to going to another restaurant by Paul Kahan."
4,"Great food but VERY pricey for the portion sizes you get. The plates are meant to be shared between a few people but in my opinion, it was more like a plate for one (maybe I just eat too much). My boyfriend took me here for dinner and we enjoyed everything. The restaurant is very family style in terms of seating, which makes the place feel homey and welcoming. There are giant pig paintings on the walls. 

Our service was wonderful. Our waters got refilled very quickly, our plates and utensils got switched out after every plate, we got checked up on often, and when one of us went to the bathroom, our napkin would get refolded and placed nicely by the staff. 

We started out with the chef selection of oysters (6/$18). They came out with a little sheet that explained where they were from and their taste. My favorite are earthy west coast oysters. 

For shareable plates, we ordered the hamachi crudo, pork belly, and sirloin. The pork belly was so tender that you aren&apos;t even given a knife to cut it. It was amazing and melt in your mouth. If you don&apos;t like fatty pork belly, you will probably not like this. The hamachi crudo was very fresh, the calamansi vinegar gave it a nice kick. The dry aged sirloin was also quite good with the cashew butter. 

We finished off with some mead and goat/sheep cheese platter. I&apos;ll be coming back to try the brunch next time."
5,"My wife and I got a well earned getaway weekend for our 10th anniversary! We decided to check out a new place we&apos;d never been to before. I had heard from several others that this place was outstanding so we decided to make a reservation for 6pm on their patio.

They offered patio or indoor seating and with the current COVID-19 Protocols we felt better about being outside. We felt very comfortable as we sat under their heat lamps and had a nice romantic dinner.

We started with their bread, which was about $9. I&apos;d say it&apos;s on the better end of the spectrum but certainly not worth the money. I mean, it&apos;s bread! 

Next we had the apple salad which was outstanding. I&apos;m not a huge apple fan but their salad blended sweet with spicy and was just the best. Then we ordered scallops and pork belly and were mesmerized by both. We decided to share everything and didn&apos;t regret it as we enjoyed every single dish they brought out. 

I would highly recommend this place to those seeking a &quot;close to normal&quot; dining experience!"
5,"If Covid&apos;s got you down and you want an excellent date night out with perfect food &amp; beverage, this is THE spot. Safe &amp; socially distant, and the menu is outstanding. They execute to perfection.

Since I&apos;m thorough, below is what we had:

Two kinds of west coast oysters I&apos;ve never had from Samich Bay, Washington: Samich Pearl (left) and Penn Cove (right). These are both third best in my mind next to Kumamotos and Kusshis. Loved em! 

Steak tartare with some seriously amazing *perfect* seeded rye bread, fresno chili dijonaise and fried shallot.

Midwestern cheese plate with fresh chevre, brie, and an ash rind gooey cheese, fennel roasted candied cashews, apricot preserves, and sweet cherries.

Not pictured, a lovely glass of Spanish cava paired with the oysters and a glass of French bordeaux just because. Plus, my hubby&apos;s Westmalle Dubbel beer which was on draft. The place has an extensive Belgian beer list, a well curated wine list, and pretty cocktails. 

I think the intention there is to go there and stuff yourself full of fresh baked bread, meat, and Belgian beer, but really I felt myself being drawn toward the vegetarian dishes. They looked stellar. Next time!

Keep up the good work Publican, your servers are doing a phenomenal job!"
5,"*pre covid review* 

Hands down one of the best brunch places in the city. Their food is just great. If you are open to trying something new but that still feels like comfort food and is delicious then this is the spot. We usually come here for brunch and it is never repetitive. Their menu has a few staples (like their mouth watering, thick, and tender bacon) that don&apos;t change much and then their main dishes which rotate and change. I love that because it means that you are forced to try something different every time. It seems risky on their end but it allows them to remain creative with new dishes and I appreciate that. 
Aside from the amazing food, the staff is great and always attentive. They take reservations which is another reason why I love them but they do book up fairly quickly for brunch some times. 

Overall I love Publican and I highly recommend coming here for brunch or dinner!"
3,"Maybe it was because I came here for brunch but I had very high expectations for this place. Due to Covid, we reserved the prepaid seating in the outdoor igloos and had trouble ordering enough to fulfill the $50 each minimum. Each main dish was ~$15. We ordered the chicken and dumpling, publican scramble (spinach, crema, and crispy shallots), and the pork belly hash. All the food were a little too salty and fatty for my taste but the portions were decent. 

While the food was not very impressive, the drinks were delicious! The bourbon cream coffee and the pear hot toddy hit the spot especially on a cold morning dining outdoors. 

The service was a little a confusion. The waitstaff seemed to be in a rush, perhaps due to the pre-paid outdoor dining time limit and constantly checked to see if we were done with our food.

This should also be made clear when making a reservation and paying a non refundable $200 deposit. Overall food was great, naturally got cold fast but the courses were well spaced. The service was a bit slow especially for how few tables there were."
1,"Terrible service.No hospitality.
We booked the weekend brunch and when we arrived we had to wait a lot until seated then waited again for the order...and again when checking out.our server was cold and showed no hospitality.
There was a lot of trashes around our outdoor seating.
Very, very unpleasant.
Our server told us that  waffle and schnitzel were unavailable, at the timing of ordering , but he should have informed us before...
And food was also average, blunt, no surprise.
Just very much pricey for their portion.
And they charged us full price though we already put $30 in advance , when we booked online...so we had to ask the server to correct it.
Never come back."
5,"Let&apos;s shine a spotlight on another restaurant that has been truly amazing during the pandemic. 

First, the food is great, even if you don&apos;t order pork. The roast chicken is delicious, with a nicely salty sauce that goes perfectly on their fries, and the sides are interesting, textured, satisfying, and creative. I&apos;m thinking of the bbq carrots with ranch sauce, the burrata with tons of veggies, etc. And the desserts - an important and tough test in my household - are superlative. 

Second, they deliver! To Hyde Park! I don&apos;t mind doing some curbside pickup when I have to, but with little kids at home and Chicago traffic being what it is, I award a huge premium to any place that will give me 30-60 minutes of my life back by delivering to my door. Down here in the ivory tower we don&apos;t have a ton of amazing delivery options. But Publican is one of them.

Third, the customer service goes above and beyond. We had planned out a great spread for a Friday night dinner. The spread arrived, but missing our roast chicken. Hamlet without the prince and all that. Many restaurants would have just apologized and refunded the chicken. But the Publican recognized that without the chicken, dinner was ruined. They rushed the chicken through the kitchen and packed it into an Uber Connect. It arrived before we were done with the first course, and saved the day. And on top of that, they added a loaf of the best Publican bread for free. And they STILL refunded the chicken. 

When I worry about whether the Chicago restaurant scene will survive the pandemic, I think: as long as places like the Publican survive, we will be ok."
4,"Great local food on the main drag on Fulton&apos;s restaurant row. They offer &quot;greenhouse&quot; private dining pods outside with a min. Purchase deposit, which we found quite nice and intimate and well as safe from COVID. Food is to be shared amongst guests and doesn&apos;t come out as a meal but more like tapas. We tried the homemade bread, mussels, shrimp, and scallops- all with lots of fresh herbs and tons of flavor."
4,"We had a really great time here. Beer was great, oysters were great, the bread and dip trio was great! The pork belly for me was just OK and the service also seemed a tiny bit lacking, but overall super glad we decided to make reservations here."
5,"Gotta call in advance and reserve you spot. Decided to check this place out after watching this show called , F*ck that&apos;s delicious, and oh my it really is !!!! We ordered the soft shell crab, oysters and pork belly and frites. That was enough for 2 people. Ambience was nice on a busy Friday night During the pandemic.. but they were extra careful and did what they need to do to make sure everyone stays safe. Really love the food here and can&apos;t wait to come back."
4,"This place is not cheap, but it is ideal for special occasions. 

We started with oysters and a cheese plate, which set the tone for my excellent scallops."
5,"Loved having brunch here! 
Their Covid precautions were well organized and clean. 

The food was amazing! The pork belly was so crispy, chewy, and flavorful. The Biscuit Sandwich with Flank Steak was also a great meal that hit the spot. The different ingredients and condiments in the sandwich complimented each other so well! My favorite was the Belgian waffle. It was so light and crispy, yet was still chewy and so delicious. The jam and butter that came with it was also the perfect complement to the syrup!

Definitely want to come again next time I&apos;m in town!"
5,"Delicious authentic Southern food from New Orleans in Chicago at the Publican. The cute, cozy, and safe dining experience in their private greenhouses. Make sure to dress warm and enjoy the experience."
5,"The ambience at The Publican is great for groups. I highly recommend making a reservation. They have communal seating so go in with the expectation that you might be seated at a table with strangers, but take advantage of it and have fun! I personally recommend the communal seating for large groups; for dates, request a booth for some more privacy and intimacy.

Dishes are family style, so I recommend ordering two dishes per person. I honestly enjoyed every dish that I ordered. The potted rillettes were my favourite. There was a great balance of savouriness and sweetness. The sourdough bread was smokey and had the right crispiness, adding texture to the dish.
The honeycrisp apple tartine was refreshing. It had a nice level of acidity that cut through the richness of another dish, the pork shank, that I had. The pork shank was tender. The sauce/jus was delicious with thin slices of mango in it.

I highly recommend The Publican. I would gladly come back to try some other dishes on the menu. I also look forward to going to another restaurant by Paul Kahan."
4,"Great food but VERY pricey for the portion sizes you get. The plates are meant to be shared between a few people but in my opinion, it was more like a plate for one (maybe I just eat too much). My boyfriend took me here for dinner and we enjoyed everything. The restaurant is very family style in terms of seating, which makes the place feel homey and welcoming. There are giant pig paintings on the walls. 

Our service was wonderful. Our waters got refilled very quickly, our plates and utensils got switched out after every plate, we got checked up on often, and when one of us went to the bathroom, our napkin would get refolded and placed nicely by the staff. 

We started out with the chef selection of oysters (6/$18). They came out with a little sheet that explained where they were from and their taste. My favorite are earthy west coast oysters. 

For shareable plates, we ordered the hamachi crudo, pork belly, and sirloin. The pork belly was so tender that you aren&apos;t even given a knife to cut it. It was amazing and melt in your mouth. If you don&apos;t like fatty pork belly, you will probably not like this. The hamachi crudo was very fresh, the calamansi vinegar gave it a nice kick. The dry aged sirloin was also quite good with the cashew butter. 

We finished off with some mead and goat/sheep cheese platter. I&apos;ll be coming back to try the brunch next time."
5,"My wife and I got a well earned getaway weekend for our 10th anniversary! We decided to check out a new place we&apos;d never been to before. I had heard from several others that this place was outstanding so we decided to make a reservation for 6pm on their patio.

They offered patio or indoor seating and with the current COVID-19 Protocols we felt better about being outside. We felt very comfortable as we sat under their heat lamps and had a nice romantic dinner.

We started with their bread, which was about $9. I&apos;d say it&apos;s on the better end of the spectrum but certainly not worth the money. I mean, it&apos;s bread! 

Next we had the apple salad which was outstanding. I&apos;m not a huge apple fan but their salad blended sweet with spicy and was just the best. Then we ordered scallops and pork belly and were mesmerized by both. We decided to share everything and didn&apos;t regret it as we enjoyed every single dish they brought out. 

I would highly recommend this place to those seeking a &quot;close to normal&quot; dining experience!"
5,"If Covid&apos;s got you down and you want an excellent date night out with perfect food &amp; beverage, this is THE spot. Safe &amp; socially distant, and the menu is outstanding. They execute to perfection.

Since I&apos;m thorough, below is what we had:

Two kinds of west coast oysters I&apos;ve never had from Samich Bay, Washington: Samich Pearl (left) and Penn Cove (right). These are both third best in my mind next to Kumamotos and Kusshis. Loved em! 

Steak tartare with some seriously amazing *perfect* seeded rye bread, fresno chili dijonaise and fried shallot.

Midwestern cheese plate with fresh chevre, brie, and an ash rind gooey cheese, fennel roasted candied cashews, apricot preserves, and sweet cherries.

Not pictured, a lovely glass of Spanish cava paired with the oysters and a glass of French bordeaux just because. Plus, my hubby&apos;s Westmalle Dubbel beer which was on draft. The place has an extensive Belgian beer list, a well curated wine list, and pretty cocktails. 

I think the intention there is to go there and stuff yourself full of fresh baked bread, meat, and Belgian beer, but really I felt myself being drawn toward the vegetarian dishes. They looked stellar. Next time!

Keep up the good work Publican, your servers are doing a phenomenal job!"
5,"*pre covid review* 

Hands down one of the best brunch places in the city. Their food is just great. If you are open to trying something new but that still feels like comfort food and is delicious then this is the spot. We usually come here for brunch and it is never repetitive. Their menu has a few staples (like their mouth watering, thick, and tender bacon) that don&apos;t change much and then their main dishes which rotate and change. I love that because it means that you are forced to try something different every time. It seems risky on their end but it allows them to remain creative with new dishes and I appreciate that. 
Aside from the amazing food, the staff is great and always attentive. They take reservations which is another reason why I love them but they do book up fairly quickly for brunch some times. 

Overall I love Publican and I highly recommend coming here for brunch or dinner!"
3,"Maybe it was because I came here for brunch but I had very high expectations for this place. Due to Covid, we reserved the prepaid seating in the outdoor igloos and had trouble ordering enough to fulfill the $50 each minimum. Each main dish was ~$15. We ordered the chicken and dumpling, publican scramble (spinach, crema, and crispy shallots), and the pork belly hash. All the food were a little too salty and fatty for my taste but the portions were decent. 

While the food was not very impressive, the drinks were delicious! The bourbon cream coffee and the pear hot toddy hit the spot especially on a cold morning dining outdoors. 

The service was a little a confusion. The waitstaff seemed to be in a rush, perhaps due to the pre-paid outdoor dining time limit and constantly checked to see if we were done with our food. 

However, I have heard good things about its dinner options and willing to try again!"
3,"First time here and first time doing the prepaid seating and our experience has been terrible so far. I understand there&apos;s a pandemic but that shouldn&apos;t be an excuse for a &quot;high end&quot; restaurant. They couldn&apos;t find our prepaid $45 reservations and they don&apos;t have 70% of the menu. We weren&apos;t told this until after we already sat down. I had 4 choices to pick from prior to my arrival and they don&apos;t have every single one of them. We had to rush to order and was completely off guard by the lack of choices. I heard raving reviews of this place and always wanted to give it a try. I support my local restaurants and businesses and this is not a good representation. I only have it 2 stars since they were somewhat accommodating to not being able to find our prepaid reservation and the mask policy is strictly enforced. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star.

Update: the server and manager were apologetic about our experience. Therefore, I upped it another star."
4,"Went for Sunday brunch on 11/22 in the igloos. Great staff, I mean stellar, excellent people. They provided recommendations, knew the menu (super important), and were honest - just down right awesome service. I was not a fan of the hash browns though. The menu literally says &quot;hash browns&quot; but they are deep fried in butter and they were very crispy like hard(maybe some people like that).  

The domes are not heated I would suggest dressing warm, and there is metered parking in walking distance. I loved the new branada toast (it&apos;s not avocado toast although it looks like it on Instagram). The chicken and dumplings were good, skillet looked good really can&apos;t go wrong."
5,"Had a fantastic experience at publican. Beer and wine list is so well rounded, truly something for everyone. We had the scallops, bread and fish dip, oysters, bbq carrots and charc plate. Everything was FANTASTIC! My fiancé a little bummed because ham plate was taken off of menu."
4,"Outdoor seating with translucent pods is a thing and it looks cool. This block of Fulton St is lined with them and you need to have your selfie taken here. 

The publican does comfort food right. By it self the dishes were fine taken as a whole, they take it up a notch. 

The farm chicken with au jus on a bed of French fries is having not only a savory and well seasoned bird but is like having poutine at the same time. The side sausage is good counter to the richness of the bird. By the way the dark meat is absolutely delicious.

The BBQ carrot tasted like meat carrot. It did not taste like a vegetable. Our server suggested the mussels which my wife and son really liked. The bread it came with was excellent. 

Fulton is now bougie - that comes with prices to match just be aware of that when you dine here."
4,"The Publican is a must visit in Chicago for brunch! And during COVID and indoor dining shutdown, they offer outdoor tent dining or individual bubble/ house dining (requires $150 deposit which is non-refundable and is applied towards your restaurant bill.) -- We did the tent and we&apos;re plenty warm. You can make reservations online, but we were able to get a table on Sunday in 45° weather without a reservation. The service was good and the food was delicious! I ordered a bourbon cream coffee which was a bit too bourbony for me, but I think bourbon lovers would go nuts for this! -- Will definitely be back to try more dishes!"

Their Covid precautions were well organized and clean. 

The food was amazing! The pork belly was so crispy, chewy, and flavorful. The Biscuit Sandwich with Flank Steak was also a great meal that hit the spot. The different ingredients and condiments in the sandwich complimented each other so well! My favorite was the Belgian waffle. It was so light and crispy, yet was still chewy and so delicious. The jam and butter that came with it was also the perfect complement to the syrup!

Definitely want to come again next time I&apos;m in town!"
5,"Delicious authentic Southern food from New Orleans in Chicago at the Publican. The cute, cozy, and safe dining experience in their private greenhouses. Make sure to dress warm and enjoy the experience."
5,"The ambience at The Publican is great for groups. I highly recommend making a reservation. They have communal seating so go in with the expectation that you might be seated at a table with strangers, but take advantage of it and have fun! I personally recommend the communal seating for large groups; for dates, request a booth for some more privacy and intimacy.

Dishes are family style, so I recommend ordering two dishes per person. I honestly enjoyed every dish that I ordered. The potted rillettes were my favourite. There was a great balance of savouriness and sweetness. The sourdough bread was smokey and had the right crispiness, adding texture to the dish.
The honeycrisp apple tartine was refreshing. It had a nice level of acidity that cut through the richness of another dish, the pork shank, that I had. The pork shank was tender. The sauce/jus was delicious with thin slices of mango in it.

I highly recommend The Publican. I would gladly come back to try some other dishes on the menu. I also look forward to going to another restaurant by Paul Kahan."
4,"Great food but VERY pricey for the portion sizes you get. The plates are meant to be shared between a few people but in my opinion, it was more like a plate for one (maybe I just eat too much). My boyfriend took me here for dinner and we enjoyed everything. The restaurant is very family style in terms of seating, which makes the place feel homey and welcoming. There are giant pig paintings on the walls. 

Our service was wonderful. Our waters got refilled very quickly, our plates and utensils got switched out after every plate, we got checked up on often, and when one of us went to the bathroom, our napkin would get refolded and placed nicely by the staff. 

We started out with the chef selection of oysters (6/$18). They came out with a little sheet that explained where they were from and their taste. My favorite are earthy west coast oysters. 

For shareable plates, we ordered the hamachi crudo, pork belly, and sirloin. The pork belly was so tender that you aren&apos;t even given a knife to cut it. It was amazing and melt in your mouth. If you don&apos;t like fatty pork belly, you will probably not like this. The hamachi crudo was very fresh, the calamansi vinegar gave it a nice kick. The dry aged sirloin was also quite good with the cashew butter. 

We finished off with some mead and goat/sheep cheese platter. I&apos;ll be coming back to try the brunch next time."
5,"My wife and I got a well earned getaway weekend for our 10th anniversary! We decided to check out a new place we&apos;d never been to before. I had heard from several others that this place was outstanding so we decided to make a reservation for 6pm on their patio.

They offered patio or indoor seating and with the current COVID-19 Protocols we felt better about being outside. We felt very comfortable as we sat under their heat lamps and had a nice romantic dinner.

We started with their bread, which was about $9. I&apos;d say it&apos;s on the better end of the spectrum but certainly not worth the money. I mean, it&apos;s bread! 

Next we had the apple salad which was outstanding. I&apos;m not a huge apple fan but their salad blended sweet with spicy and was just the best. Then we ordered scallops and pork belly and were mesmerized by both. We decided to share everything and didn&apos;t regret it as we enjoyed every single dish they brought out. 

I would highly recommend this place to those seeking a &quot;close to normal&quot; dining experience!"
5,"If Covid&apos;s got you down and you want an excellent date night out with perfect food &amp; beverage, this is THE spot. Safe &amp; socially distant, and the menu is outstanding. They execute to perfection.

Since I&apos;m thorough, below is what we had:

Two kinds of west coast oysters I&apos;ve never had from Samich Bay, Washington: Samich Pearl (left) and Penn Cove (right). These are both third best in my mind next to Kumamotos and Kusshis. Loved em! 

Steak tartare with some seriously amazing *perfect* seeded rye bread, fresno chili dijonaise and fried shallot.

Midwestern cheese plate with fresh chevre, brie, and an ash rind gooey cheese, fennel roasted candied cashews, apricot preserves, and sweet cherries.

Not pictured, a lovely glass of Spanish cava paired with the oysters and a glass of French bordeaux just because. Plus, my hubby&apos;s Westmalle Dubbel beer which was on draft. The place has an extensive Belgian beer list, a well curated wine list, and pretty cocktails. 

I think the intention there is to go there and stuff yourself full of fresh baked bread, meat, and Belgian beer, but really I felt myself being drawn toward the vegetarian dishes. They looked stellar. Next time!

Keep up the good work Publican, your servers are doing a phenomenal job!"
5,"*pre covid review* 

Hands down one of the best brunch places in the city. Their food is just great. If you are open to trying something new but that still feels like comfort food and is delicious then this is the spot. We usually come here for brunch and it is never repetitive. Their menu has a few staples (like their mouth watering, thick, and tender bacon) that don&apos;t change much and then their main dishes which rotate and change. I love that because it means that you are forced to try something different every time. It seems risky on their end but it allows them to remain creative with new dishes and I appreciate that. 
Aside from the amazing food, the staff is great and always attentive. They take reservations which is another reason why I love them but they do book up fairly quickly for brunch some times. 

Overall I love Publican and I highly recommend coming here for brunch or dinner!"
3,"Maybe it was because I came here for brunch but I had very high expectations for this place. Due to Covid, we reserved the prepaid seating in the outdoor igloos and had trouble ordering enough to fulfill the $50 each minimum. Each main dish was ~$15. We ordered the chicken and dumpling, publican scramble (spinach, crema, and crispy shallots), and the pork belly hash. All the food were a little too salty and fatty for my taste but the portions were decent. 

While the food was not very impressive, the drinks were delicious! The bourbon cream coffee and the pear hot toddy hit the spot especially on a cold morning dining outdoors. 

The service was a little a confusion. The waitstaff seemed to be in a rush, perhaps due to the pre-paid outdoor dining time limit and constantly checked to see if we were done with our food. 

However, I have heard good things about its dinner options and willing to try again!"
3,"First time here and first time doing the prepaid seating and our experience has been terrible so far. I understand there&apos;s a pandemic but that shouldn&apos;t be an excuse for a &quot;high end&quot; restaurant. They couldn&apos;t find our prepaid $45 reservations and they don&apos;t have 70% of the menu. We weren&apos;t told this until after we already sat down. I had 4 choices to pick from prior to my arrival and they don&apos;t have every single one of them. We had to rush to order and was completely off guard by the lack of choices. I heard raving reviews of this place and always wanted to give it a try. I support my local restaurants and businesses and this is not a good representation. I only have it 2 stars since they were somewhat accommodating to not being able to find our prepaid reservation and the mask policy is strictly enforced. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star.

Update: the server and manager were apologetic about our experience. Therefore, I upped it another star."
4,"Went for Sunday brunch on 11/22 in the igloos. Great staff, I mean stellar, excellent people. They provided recommendations, knew the menu (super important), and were honest - just down right awesome service. I was not a fan of the hash browns though. The menu literally says &quot;hash browns&quot; but they are deep fried in butter and they were very crispy like hard(maybe some people like that).  

The domes are not heated I would suggest dressing warm, and there is metered parking in walking distance. I loved the new branada toast (it&apos;s not avocado toast although it looks like it on Instagram). The chicken and dumplings were good, skillet looked good really can&apos;t go wrong."
5,"Had a fantastic experience at publican. Beer and wine list is so well rounded, truly something for everyone. We had the scallops, bread and fish dip, oysters, bbq carrots and charc plate. Everything was FANTASTIC! My fiancé a little bummed because ham plate was taken off of menu."
4,"Outdoor seating with translucent pods is a thing and it looks cool. This block of Fulton St is lined with them and you need to have your selfie taken here. 

The publican does comfort food right. By it self the dishes were fine taken as a whole, they take it up a notch. 

The farm chicken with au jus on a bed of French fries is having not only a savory and well seasoned bird but is like having poutine at the same time. The side sausage is good counter to the richness of the bird. By the way the dark meat is absolutely delicious.

The BBQ carrot tasted like meat carrot. It did not taste like a vegetable. Our server suggested the mussels which my wife and son really liked. The bread it came with was excellent. 

Fulton is now bougie - that comes with prices to match just be aware of that when you dine here."
4,"The Publican is a must visit in Chicago for brunch! And during COVID and indoor dining shutdown, they offer outdoor tent dining or individual bubble/ house dining (requires $150 deposit which is non-refundable and is applied towards your restaurant bill.) -- We did the tent and we&apos;re plenty warm. You can make reservations online, but we were able to get a table on Sunday in 45° weather without a reservation. The service was good and the food was delicious! I ordered a bourbon cream coffee which was a bit too bourbony for me, but I think bourbon lovers would go nuts for this! -- Will definitely be back to try more dishes!"
3,"We ate in one of the igloos- &quot;private domes&quot;- they are not heated. The reservation system says &quot;dine without the elements.&quot; You are in the elements when it is cold out, the description is quite misleading. The igloos also have an open flap which also lets a lot of heat escape. 
This should also be made clear when making a reservation and paying a non refundable $200 deposit. Overall food was great, naturally got cold fast but the courses were well spaced. The service was a bit slow especially for how few tables there were."
1,"Terrible service.No hospitality.
We booked the weekend brunch and when we arrived we had to wait a lot until seated then waited again for the order...and again when checking out.our server was cold and showed no hospitality.
There was a lot of trashes around our outdoor seating.
Very, very unpleasant.
Our server told us that  waffle and schnitzel were unavailable, at the timing of ordering , but he should have informed us before...
And food was also average, blunt, no surprise.
Just very much pricey for their portion.
And they charged us full price though we already put $30 in advance , when we booked online...so we had to ask the server to correct it.
Never come back."
5,"Let&apos;s shine a spotlight on another restaurant that has been truly amazing during the pandemic. 

First, the food is great, even if you don&apos;t order pork. The roast chicken is delicious, with a nicely salty sauce that goes perfectly on their fries, and the sides are interesting, textured, satisfying, and creative. I&apos;m thinking of the bbq carrots with ranch sauce, the burrata with tons of veggies, etc. And the desserts - an important and tough test in my household - are superlative. 

Second, they deliver! To Hyde Park! I don&apos;t mind doing some curbside pickup when I have to, but with little kids at home and Chicago traffic being what it is, I award a huge premium to any place that will give me 30-60 minutes of my life back by delivering to my door. Down here in the ivory tower we don&apos;t have a ton of amazing delivery options. But Publican is one of them.

Third, the customer service goes above and beyond. We had planned out a great spread for a Friday night dinner. The spread arrived, but missing our roast chicken. Hamlet without the prince and all that. Many restaurants would have just apologized and refunded the chicken. But the Publican recognized that without the chicken, dinner was ruined. They rushed the chicken through the kitchen and packed it into an Uber Connect. It arrived before we were done with the first course, and saved the day. And on top of that, they added a loaf of the best Publican bread for free. And they STILL refunded the chicken. 

When I worry about whether the Chicago restaurant scene will survive the pandemic, I think: as long as places like the Publican survive, we will be ok."
4,"Great local food on the main drag on Fulton&apos;s restaurant row. They offer &quot;greenhouse&quot; private dining pods outside with a min. Purchase deposit, which we found quite nice and intimate and well as safe from COVID. Food is to be shared amongst guests and doesn&apos;t come out as a meal but more like tapas. We tried the homemade bread, mussels, shrimp, and scallops- all with lots of fresh herbs and tons of flavor."
4,"We had a really great time here. Beer was great, oysters were great, the bread and dip trio was great! The pork belly for me was just OK and the service also seemed a tiny bit lacking, but overall super glad we decided to make reservations here."
5,"Gotta call in advance and reserve you spot. Decided to check this place out after watching this show called , F*ck that&apos;s delicious, and oh my it really is !!!! We ordered the soft shell crab, oysters and pork belly and frites. That was enough for 2 people. Ambience was nice on a busy Friday night During the pandemic.. but they were extra careful and did what they need to do to make sure everyone stays safe. Really love the food here and can&apos;t wait to come back."

Then we ordered scallops and pork belly and were mesmerized by both. We decided to share everything and didn&apos;t regret it as we enjoyed every single dish they brought out. 

I would highly recommend this place to those seeking a &quot;close to normal&quot; dining experience!"
5,"If Covid&apos;s got you down and you want an excellent date night out with perfect food &amp; beverage, this is THE spot. Safe &amp; socially distant, and the menu is outstanding. They execute to perfection.

Since I&apos;m thorough, below is what we had:

Two kinds of west coast oysters I&apos;ve never had from Samich Bay, Washington: Samich Pearl (left) and Penn Cove (right). These are both third best in my mind next to Kumamotos and Kusshis. Loved em! 

Steak tartare with some seriously amazing *perfect* seeded rye bread, fresno chili dijonaise and fried shallot.

Midwestern cheese plate with fresh chevre, brie, and an ash rind gooey cheese, fennel roasted candied cashews, apricot preserves, and sweet cherries.

Not pictured, a lovely glass of Spanish cava paired with the oysters and a glass of French bordeaux just because. Plus, my hubby&apos;s Westmalle Dubbel beer which was on draft. The place has an extensive Belgian beer list, a well curated wine list, and pretty cocktails. 

I think the intention there is to go there and stuff yourself full of fresh baked bread, meat, and Belgian beer, but really I felt myself being drawn toward the vegetarian dishes. They looked stellar. Next time!

Keep up the good work Publican, your servers are doing a phenomenal job!"
5,"*pre covid review* 

Hands down one of the best brunch places in the city. Their food is just great. If you are open to trying something new but that still feels like comfort food and is delicious then this is the spot. We usually come here for brunch and it is never repetitive. Their menu has a few staples (like their mouth watering, thick, and tender bacon) that don&apos;t change much and then their main dishes which rotate and change. I love that because it means that you are forced to try something different every time. It seems risky on their end but it allows them to remain creative with new dishes and I appreciate that. 
Aside from the amazing food, the staff is great and always attentive. They take reservations which is another reason why I love them but they do book up fairly quickly for brunch some times. 

Overall I love Publican and I highly recommend coming here for brunch or dinner!"
3,"Maybe it was because I came here for brunch but I had very high expectations for this place. Due to Covid, we reserved the prepaid seating in the outdoor igloos and had trouble ordering enough to fulfill the $50 each minimum. Each main dish was ~$15. We ordered the chicken and dumpling, publican scramble (spinach, crema, and crispy shallots), and the pork belly hash. All the food were a little too salty and fatty for my taste but the portions were decent. 

While the food was not very impressive, the drinks were delicious! The bourbon cream coffee and the pear hot toddy hit the spot especially on a cold morning dining outdoors. 

The service was a little a confusion. The waitstaff seemed to be in a rush, perhaps due to the pre-paid outdoor dining time limit and constantly checked to see if we were done with our food. 

However, I have heard good things about its dinner options and willing to try again!"
3,"First time here and first time doing the prepaid seating and our experience has been terrible so far. I understand there&apos;s a pandemic but that shouldn&apos;t be an excuse for a &quot;high end&quot; restaurant. They couldn&apos;t find our prepaid $45 reservations and they don&apos;t have 70% of the menu. We weren&apos;t told this until after we already sat down. I had 4 choices to pick from prior to my arrival and they don&apos;t have every single one of them. We had to rush to order and was completely off guard by the lack of choices. I heard raving reviews of this place and always wanted to give it a try. I support my local restaurants and businesses and this is not a good representation. I only have it 2 stars since they were somewhat accommodating to not being able to find our prepaid reservation and the mask policy is strictly enforced. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star.

Update: the server and manager were apologetic about our experience. Therefore, I upped it another star."
4,"Went for Sunday brunch on 11/22 in the igloos. Great staff, I mean stellar, excellent people. They provided recommendations, knew the menu (super important), and were honest - just down right awesome service. I was not a fan of the hash browns though. The menu literally says &quot;hash browns&quot; but they are deep fried in butter and they were very crispy like hard(maybe some people like that).  

The domes are not heated I would suggest dressing warm, and there is metered parking in walking distance. I loved the new branada toast (it&apos;s not avocado toast although it looks like it on Instagram). The chicken and dumplings were good, skillet looked good really can&apos;t go wrong."
5,"Had a fantastic experience at publican. Beer and wine list is so well rounded, truly something for everyone. We had the scallops, bread and fish dip, oysters, bbq carrots and charc plate. Everything was FANTASTIC! My fiancé a little bummed because ham plate was taken off of menu."
4,"Outdoor seating with translucent pods is a thing and it looks cool. This block of Fulton St is lined with them and you need to have your selfie taken here. 

The publican does comfort food right. By it self the dishes were fine taken as a whole, they take it up a notch. 

The farm chicken with au jus on a bed of French fries is having not only a savory and well seasoned bird but is like having poutine at the same time. The side sausage is good counter to the richness of the bird. By the way the dark meat is absolutely delicious.

The BBQ carrot tasted like meat carrot. It did not taste like a vegetable. Our server suggested the mussels which my wife and son really liked. The bread it came with was excellent. 

Fulton is now bougie - that comes with prices to match just be aware of that when you dine here."
4,"The Publican is a must visit in Chicago for brunch! And during COVID and indoor dining shutdown, they offer outdoor tent dining or individual bubble/ house dining (requires $150 deposit which is non-refundable and is applied towards your restaurant bill.) -- We did the tent and we&apos;re plenty warm. You can make reservations online, but we were able to get a table on Sunday in 45° weather without a reservation. The service was good and the food was delicious! I ordered a bourbon cream coffee which was a bit too bourbony for me, but I think bourbon lovers would go nuts for this! -- Will definitely be back to try more dishes!"
3,"We ate in one of the igloos- &quot;private domes&quot;- they are not heated. The reservation system says &quot;dine without the elements.&quot; You are in the elements when it is cold out, the description is quite misleading. The igloos also have an open flap which also lets a lot of heat escape. 
This should also be made clear when making a reservation and paying a non refundable $200 deposit. Overall food was great, naturally got cold fast but the courses were well spaced. The service was a bit slow especially for how few tables there were."
1,"Terrible service.No hospitality.
We booked the weekend brunch and when we arrived we had to wait a lot until seated then waited again for the order...and again when checking out.our server was cold and showed no hospitality.
There was a lot of trashes around our outdoor seating.
Very, very unpleasant.
Our server told us that  waffle and schnitzel were unavailable, at the timing of ordering , but he should have informed us before...
And food was also average, blunt, no surprise.
Just very much pricey for their portion.
And they charged us full price though we already put $30 in advance , when we booked online...so we had to ask the server to correct it.
Never come back."
5,"Let&apos;s shine a spotlight on another restaurant that has been truly amazing during the pandemic. 

First, the food is great, even if you don&apos;t order pork. The roast chicken is delicious, with a nicely salty sauce that goes perfectly on their fries, and the sides are interesting, textured, satisfying, and creative. I&apos;m thinking of the bbq carrots with ranch sauce, the burrata with tons of veggies, etc. And the desserts - an important and tough test in my household - are superlative. 

Second, they deliver! To Hyde Park! I don&apos;t mind doing some curbside pickup when I have to, but with little kids at home and Chicago traffic being what it is, I award a huge premium to any place that will give me 30-60 minutes of my life back by delivering to my door. Down here in the ivory tower we don&apos;t have a ton of amazing delivery options. But Publican is one of them.

Third, the customer service goes above and beyond. We had planned out a great spread for a Friday night dinner. The spread arrived, but missing our roast chicken. Hamlet without the prince and all that. Many restaurants would have just apologized and refunded the chicken. But the Publican recognized that without the chicken, dinner was ruined. They rushed the chicken through the kitchen and packed it into an Uber Connect. It arrived before we were done with the first course, and saved the day. And on top of that, they added a loaf of the best Publican bread for free. And they STILL refunded the chicken. 

When I worry about whether the Chicago restaurant scene will survive the pandemic, I think: as long as places like the Publican survive, we will be ok."
4,"Great local food on the main drag on Fulton&apos;s restaurant row. They offer &quot;greenhouse&quot; private dining pods outside with a min. Purchase deposit, which we found quite nice and intimate and well as safe from COVID. Food is to be shared amongst guests and doesn&apos;t come out as a meal but more like tapas. We tried the homemade bread, mussels, shrimp, and scallops- all with lots of fresh herbs and tons of flavor."
4,"We had a really great time here. Beer was great, oysters were great, the bread and dip trio was great! The pork belly for me was just OK and the service also seemed a tiny bit lacking, but overall super glad we decided to make reservations here."
5,"Gotta call in advance and reserve you spot. Decided to check this place out after watching this show called , F*ck that&apos;s delicious, and oh my it really is !!!! We ordered the soft shell crab, oysters and pork belly and frites. That was enough for 2 people. Ambience was nice on a busy Friday night During the pandemic.. but they were extra careful and did what they need to do to make sure everyone stays safe. Really love the food here and can&apos;t wait to come back."
4,"This place is not cheap, but it is ideal for special occasions. 

We started with oysters and a cheese plate, which set the tone for my excellent scallops."
5,"Loved having brunch here! 
Their Covid precautions were well organized and clean. 

The food was amazing! The pork belly was so crispy, chewy, and flavorful. The Biscuit Sandwich with Flank Steak was also a great meal that hit the spot. The different ingredients and condiments in the sandwich complimented each other so well! My favorite was the Belgian waffle. It was so light and crispy, yet was still chewy and so delicious. The jam and butter that came with it was also the perfect complement to the syrup!

Definitely want to come again next time I&apos;m in town!"
5,"Delicious authentic Southern food from New Orleans in Chicago at the Publican. The cute, cozy, and safe dining experience in their private greenhouses. Make sure to dress warm and enjoy the experience."
5,"The ambience at The Publican is great for groups. I highly recommend making a reservation. They have communal seating so go in with the expectation that you might be seated at a table with strangers, but take advantage of it and have fun! I personally recommend the communal seating for large groups; for dates, request a booth for some more privacy and intimacy.

Dishes are family style, so I recommend ordering two dishes per person. I honestly enjoyed every dish that I ordered. The potted rillettes were my favourite. There was a great balance of savouriness and sweetness. The sourdough bread was smokey and had the right crispiness, adding texture to the dish.
The honeycrisp apple tartine was refreshing. It had a nice level of acidity that cut through the richness of another dish, the pork shank, that I had. The pork shank was tender. The sauce/jus was delicious with thin slices of mango in it.

I highly recommend The Publican. I would gladly come back to try some other dishes on the menu. I also look forward to going to another restaurant by Paul Kahan."
4,"Great food but VERY pricey for the portion sizes you get. The plates are meant to be shared between a few people but in my opinion, it was more like a plate for one (maybe I just eat too much). My boyfriend took me here for dinner and we enjoyed everything. The restaurant is very family style in terms of seating, which makes the place feel homey and welcoming. There are giant pig paintings on the walls. 

Our service was wonderful. Our waters got refilled very quickly, our plates and utensils got switched out after every plate, we got checked up on often, and when one of us went to the bathroom, our napkin would get refolded and placed nicely by the staff. 

We started out with the chef selection of oysters (6/$18). They came out with a little sheet that explained where they were from and their taste. My favorite are earthy west coast oysters. 

For shareable plates, we ordered the hamachi crudo, pork belly, and sirloin. The pork belly was so tender that you aren&apos;t even given a knife to cut it. It was amazing and melt in your mouth. If you don&apos;t like fatty pork belly, you will probably not like this. The hamachi crudo was very fresh, the calamansi vinegar gave it a nice kick. The dry aged sirloin was also quite good with the cashew butter. 

We finished off with some mead and goat/sheep cheese platter. I&apos;ll be coming back to try the brunch next time."
5,"My wife and I got a well earned getaway weekend for our 10th anniversary! We decided to check out a new place we&apos;d never been to before. I had heard from several others that this place was outstanding so we decided to make a reservation for 6pm on their patio.

They offered patio or indoor seating and with the current COVID-19 Protocols we felt better about being outside. We felt very comfortable as we sat under their heat lamps and had a nice romantic dinner.

We started with their bread, which was about $9. I&apos;d say it&apos;s on the better end of the spectrum but certainly not worth the money. I mean, it&apos;s bread!

I had 4 choices to pick from prior to my arrival and they don&apos;t have every single one of them. We had to rush to order and was completely off guard by the lack of choices. I heard raving reviews of this place and always wanted to give it a try. I support my local restaurants and businesses and this is not a good representation. I only have it 2 stars since they were somewhat accommodating to not being able to find our prepaid reservation and the mask policy is strictly enforced. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star.

Update: the server and manager were apologetic about our experience. Therefore, I upped it another star."
4,"Went for Sunday brunch on 11/22 in the igloos. Great staff, I mean stellar, excellent people. They provided recommendations, knew the menu (super important), and were honest - just down right awesome service. I was not a fan of the hash browns though. The menu literally says &quot;hash browns&quot; but they are deep fried in butter and they were very crispy like hard(maybe some people like that).  

The domes are not heated I would suggest dressing warm, and there is metered parking in walking distance. I loved the new branada toast (it&apos;s not avocado toast although it looks like it on Instagram). The chicken and dumplings were good, skillet looked good really can&apos;t go wrong."
5,"Had a fantastic experience at publican. Beer and wine list is so well rounded, truly something for everyone. We had the scallops, bread and fish dip, oysters, bbq carrots and charc plate. Everything was FANTASTIC! My fiancé a little bummed because ham plate was taken off of menu."
4,"Outdoor seating with translucent pods is a thing and it looks cool. This block of Fulton St is lined with them and you need to have your selfie taken here. 

The publican does comfort food right. By it self the dishes were fine taken as a whole, they take it up a notch. 

The farm chicken with au jus on a bed of French fries is having not only a savory and well seasoned bird but is like having poutine at the same time. The side sausage is good counter to the richness of the bird. By the way the dark meat is absolutely delicious.

The BBQ carrot tasted like meat carrot. It did not taste like a vegetable. Our server suggested the mussels which my wife and son really liked. The bread it came with was excellent. 

Fulton is now bougie - that comes with prices to match just be aware of that when you dine here."
4,"The Publican is a must visit in Chicago for brunch! And during COVID and indoor dining shutdown, they offer outdoor tent dining or individual bubble/ house dining (requires $150 deposit which is non-refundable and is applied towards your restaurant bill.) -- We did the tent and we&apos;re plenty warm. You can make reservations online, but we were able to get a table on Sunday in 45° weather without a reservation. The service was good and the food was delicious! I ordered a bourbon cream coffee which was a bit too bourbony for me, but I think bourbon lovers would go nuts for this! -- Will definitely be back to try more dishes!"
3,"We ate in one of the igloos- &quot;private domes&quot;- they are not heated. The reservation system says &quot;dine without the elements.&quot; You are in the elements when it is cold out, the description is quite misleading. The igloos also have an open flap which also lets a lot of heat escape. 
This should also be made clear when making a reservation and paying a non refundable $200 deposit. Overall food was great, naturally got cold fast but the courses were well spaced. The service was a bit slow especially for how few tables there were."
1,"Terrible service.No hospitality.
We booked the weekend brunch and when we arrived we had to wait a lot until seated then waited again for the order...and again when checking out.our server was cold and showed no hospitality.
There was a lot of trashes around our outdoor seating.
Very, very unpleasant.
Our server told us that  waffle and schnitzel were unavailable, at the timing of ordering , but he should have informed us before...
And food was also average, blunt, no surprise.
Just very much pricey for their portion.
And they charged us full price though we already put $30 in advance , when we booked online...so we had to ask the server to correct it.
Never come back."
5,"Let&apos;s shine a spotlight on another restaurant that has been truly amazing during the pandemic. 

First, the food is great, even if you don&apos;t order pork. The roast chicken is delicious, with a nicely salty sauce that goes perfectly on their fries, and the sides are interesting, textured, satisfying, and creative. I&apos;m thinking of the bbq carrots with ranch sauce, the burrata with tons of veggies, etc. And the desserts - an important and tough test in my household - are superlative. 

Second, they deliver! To Hyde Park! I don&apos;t mind doing some curbside pickup when I have to, but with little kids at home and Chicago traffic being what it is, I award a huge premium to any place that will give me 30-60 minutes of my life back by delivering to my door. Down here in the ivory tower we don&apos;t have a ton of amazing delivery options. But Publican is one of them.

Third, the customer service goes above and beyond. We had planned out a great spread for a Friday night dinner. The spread arrived, but missing our roast chicken. Hamlet without the prince and all that. Many restaurants would have just apologized and refunded the chicken. But the Publican recognized that without the chicken, dinner was ruined. They rushed the chicken through the kitchen and packed it into an Uber Connect. It arrived before we were done with the first course, and saved the day. And on top of that, they added a loaf of the best Publican bread for free. And they STILL refunded the chicken. 

When I worry about whether the Chicago restaurant scene will survive the pandemic, I think: as long as places like the Publican survive, we will be ok."
4,"Great local food on the main drag on Fulton&apos;s restaurant row. They offer &quot;greenhouse&quot; private dining pods outside with a min. Purchase deposit, which we found quite nice and intimate and well as safe from COVID. Food is to be shared amongst guests and doesn&apos;t come out as a meal but more like tapas. We tried the homemade bread, mussels, shrimp, and scallops- all with lots of fresh herbs and tons of flavor."
4,"We had a really great time here. Beer was great, oysters were great, the bread and dip trio was great! The pork belly for me was just OK and the service also seemed a tiny bit lacking, but overall super glad we decided to make reservations here."
5,"Gotta call in advance and reserve you spot. Decided to check this place out after watching this show called , F*ck that&apos;s delicious, and oh my it really is !!!! We ordered the soft shell crab, oysters and pork belly and frites. That was enough for 2 people. Ambience was nice on a busy Friday night During the pandemic.. but they were extra careful and did what they need to do to make sure everyone stays safe. Really love the food here and can&apos;t wait to come back."
4,"This place is not cheap, but it is ideal for special occasions. 

We started with oysters and a cheese plate, which set the tone for my excellent scallops."
5,"Loved having brunch here! 
Their Covid precautions were well organized and clean. 

The food was amazing! The pork belly was so crispy, chewy, and flavorful. The Biscuit Sandwich with Flank Steak was also a great meal that hit the spot. The different ingredients and condiments in the sandwich complimented each other so well! My favorite was the Belgian waffle. It was so light and crispy, yet was still chewy and so delicious. The jam and butter that came with it was also the perfect complement to the syrup!

Definitely want to come again next time I&apos;m in town!"
5,"Delicious authentic Southern food from New Orleans in Chicago at the Publican. The cute, cozy, and safe dining experience in their private greenhouses. Make sure to dress warm and enjoy the experience."
5,"The ambience at The Publican is great for groups. I highly recommend making a reservation. They have communal seating so go in with the expectation that you might be seated at a table with strangers, but take advantage of it and have fun! I personally recommend the communal seating for large groups; for dates, request a booth for some more privacy and intimacy.

Dishes are family style, so I recommend ordering two dishes per person. I honestly enjoyed every dish that I ordered. The potted rillettes were my favourite. There was a great balance of savouriness and sweetness. The sourdough bread was smokey and had the right crispiness, adding texture to the dish.
The honeycrisp apple tartine was refreshing. It had a nice level of acidity that cut through the richness of another dish, the pork shank, that I had. The pork shank was tender. The sauce/jus was delicious with thin slices of mango in it.

I highly recommend The Publican. I would gladly come back to try some other dishes on the menu. I also look forward to going to another restaurant by Paul Kahan."
4,"Great food but VERY pricey for the portion sizes you get. The plates are meant to be shared between a few people but in my opinion, it was more like a plate for one (maybe I just eat too much). My boyfriend took me here for dinner and we enjoyed everything. The restaurant is very family style in terms of seating, which makes the place feel homey and welcoming. There are giant pig paintings on the walls. 

Our service was wonderful. Our waters got refilled very quickly, our plates and utensils got switched out after every plate, we got checked up on often, and when one of us went to the bathroom, our napkin would get refolded and placed nicely by the staff. 

We started out with the chef selection of oysters (6/$18). They came out with a little sheet that explained where they were from and their taste. My favorite are earthy west coast oysters. 

For shareable plates, we ordered the hamachi crudo, pork belly, and sirloin. The pork belly was so tender that you aren&apos;t even given a knife to cut it. It was amazing and melt in your mouth. If you don&apos;t like fatty pork belly, you will probably not like this. The hamachi crudo was very fresh, the calamansi vinegar gave it a nice kick. The dry aged sirloin was also quite good with the cashew butter. 

We finished off with some mead and goat/sheep cheese platter. I&apos;ll be coming back to try the brunch next time."
5,"My wife and I got a well earned getaway weekend for our 10th anniversary! We decided to check out a new place we&apos;d never been to before. I had heard from several others that this place was outstanding so we decided to make a reservation for 6pm on their patio.

They offered patio or indoor seating and with the current COVID-19 Protocols we felt better about being outside. We felt very comfortable as we sat under their heat lamps and had a nice romantic dinner.

We started with their bread, which was about $9. I&apos;d say it&apos;s on the better end of the spectrum but certainly not worth the money. I mean, it&apos;s bread! 

Next we had the apple salad which was outstanding. I&apos;m not a huge apple fan but their salad blended sweet with spicy and was just the best. Then we ordered scallops and pork belly and were mesmerized by both. We decided to share everything and didn&apos;t regret it as we enjoyed every single dish they brought out. 

I would highly recommend this place to those seeking a &quot;close to normal&quot; dining experience!"
5,"If Covid&apos;s got you down and you want an excellent date night out with perfect food &amp; beverage, this is THE spot. Safe &amp; socially distant, and the menu is outstanding. They execute to perfection.

Since I&apos;m thorough, below is what we had:

Two kinds of west coast oysters I&apos;ve never had from Samich Bay, Washington: Samich Pearl (left) and Penn Cove (right). These are both third best in my mind next to Kumamotos and Kusshis. Loved em! 

Steak tartare with some seriously amazing *perfect* seeded rye bread, fresno chili dijonaise and fried shallot.

Midwestern cheese plate with fresh chevre, brie, and an ash rind gooey cheese, fennel roasted candied cashews, apricot preserves, and sweet cherries.

Not pictured, a lovely glass of Spanish cava paired with the oysters and a glass of French bordeaux just because. Plus, my hubby&apos;s Westmalle Dubbel beer which was on draft. The place has an extensive Belgian beer list, a well curated wine list, and pretty cocktails. 

I think the intention there is to go there and stuff yourself full of fresh baked bread, meat, and Belgian beer, but really I felt myself being drawn toward the vegetarian dishes. They looked stellar. Next time!

Keep up the good work Publican, your servers are doing a phenomenal job!"
5,"*pre covid review* 

Hands down one of the best brunch places in the city. Their food is just great. If you are open to trying something new but that still feels like comfort food and is delicious then this is the spot. We usually come here for brunch and it is never repetitive. Their menu has a few staples (like their mouth watering, thick, and tender bacon) that don&apos;t change much and then their main dishes which rotate and change. I love that because it means that you are forced to try something different every time. It seems risky on their end but it allows them to remain creative with new dishes and I appreciate that. 
Aside from the amazing food, the staff is great and always attentive. They take reservations which is another reason why I love them but they do book up fairly quickly for brunch some times. 

Overall I love Publican and I highly recommend coming here for brunch or dinner!"
3,"Maybe it was because I came here for brunch but I had very high expectations for this place. Due to Covid, we reserved the prepaid seating in the outdoor igloos and had trouble ordering enough to fulfill the $50 each minimum. Each main dish was ~$15. We ordered the chicken and dumpling, publican scramble (spinach, crema, and crispy shallots), and the pork belly hash. All the food were a little too salty and fatty for my taste but the portions were decent. 

While the food was not very impressive, the drinks were delicious! The bourbon cream coffee and the pear hot toddy hit the spot especially on a cold morning dining outdoors. 

The service was a little a confusion. The waitstaff seemed to be in a rush, perhaps due to the pre-paid outdoor dining time limit and constantly checked to see if we were done with our food. 

However, I have heard good things about its dinner options and willing to try again!"

Very, very unpleasant.
Our server told us that  waffle and schnitzel were unavailable, at the timing of ordering , but he should have informed us before...
And food was also average, blunt, no surprise.
Just very much pricey for their portion.
And they charged us full price though we already put $30 in advance , when we booked online...so we had to ask the server to correct it.
Never come back."
5,"Let&apos;s shine a spotlight on another restaurant that has been truly amazing during the pandemic. 

First, the food is great, even if you don&apos;t order pork. The roast chicken is delicious, with a nicely salty sauce that goes perfectly on their fries, and the sides are interesting, textured, satisfying, and creative. I&apos;m thinking of the bbq carrots with ranch sauce, the burrata with tons of veggies, etc. And the desserts - an important and tough test in my household - are superlative. 

Second, they deliver! To Hyde Park! I don&apos;t mind doing some curbside pickup when I have to, but with little kids at home and Chicago traffic being what it is, I award a huge premium to any place that will give me 30-60 minutes of my life back by delivering to my door. Down here in the ivory tower we don&apos;t have a ton of amazing delivery options. But Publican is one of them.

Third, the customer service goes above and beyond. We had planned out a great spread for a Friday night dinner. The spread arrived, but missing our roast chicken. Hamlet without the prince and all that. Many restaurants would have just apologized and refunded the chicken. But the Publican recognized that without the chicken, dinner was ruined. They rushed the chicken through the kitchen and packed it into an Uber Connect. It arrived before we were done with the first course, and saved the day. And on top of that, they added a loaf of the best Publican bread for free. And they STILL refunded the chicken. 

When I worry about whether the Chicago restaurant scene will survive the pandemic, I think: as long as places like the Publican survive, we will be ok."
4,"Great local food on the main drag on Fulton&apos;s restaurant row. They offer &quot;greenhouse&quot; private dining pods outside with a min. Purchase deposit, which we found quite nice and intimate and well as safe from COVID. Food is to be shared amongst guests and doesn&apos;t come out as a meal but more like tapas. We tried the homemade bread, mussels, shrimp, and scallops- all with lots of fresh herbs and tons of flavor."
4,"We had a really great time here. Beer was great, oysters were great, the bread and dip trio was great! The pork belly for me was just OK and the service also seemed a tiny bit lacking, but overall super glad we decided to make reservations here."
5,"Gotta call in advance and reserve you spot. Decided to check this place out after watching this show called , F*ck that&apos;s delicious, and oh my it really is !!!! We ordered the soft shell crab, oysters and pork belly and frites. That was enough for 2 people. Ambience was nice on a busy Friday night During the pandemic.. but they were extra careful and did what they need to do to make sure everyone stays safe. Really love the food here and can&apos;t wait to come back."
4,"This place is not cheap, but it is ideal for special occasions. 

We started with oysters and a cheese plate, which set the tone for my excellent scallops."
5,"Loved having brunch here! 
Their Covid precautions were well organized and clean. 

The food was amazing! The pork belly was so crispy, chewy, and flavorful. The Biscuit Sandwich with Flank Steak was also a great meal that hit the spot. The different ingredients and condiments in the sandwich complimented each other so well! My favorite was the Belgian waffle. It was so light and crispy, yet was still chewy and so delicious. The jam and butter that came with it was also the perfect complement to the syrup!

Definitely want to come again next time I&apos;m in town!"
5,"Delicious authentic Southern food from New Orleans in Chicago at the Publican. The cute, cozy, and safe dining experience in their private greenhouses. Make sure to dress warm and enjoy the experience."
5,"The ambience at The Publican is great for groups. I highly recommend making a reservation. They have communal seating so go in with the expectation that you might be seated at a table with strangers, but take advantage of it and have fun! I personally recommend the communal seating for large groups; for dates, request a booth for some more privacy and intimacy.

Dishes are family style, so I recommend ordering two dishes per person. I honestly enjoyed every dish that I ordered. The potted rillettes were my favourite. There was a great balance of savouriness and sweetness. The sourdough bread was smokey and had the right crispiness, adding texture to the dish.
The honeycrisp apple tartine was refreshing. It had a nice level of acidity that cut through the richness of another dish, the pork shank, that I had. The pork shank was tender. The sauce/jus was delicious with thin slices of mango in it.

I highly recommend The Publican. I would gladly come back to try some other dishes on the menu. I also look forward to going to another restaurant by Paul Kahan."
4,"Great food but VERY pricey for the portion sizes you get. The plates are meant to be shared between a few people but in my opinion, it was more like a plate for one (maybe I just eat too much). My boyfriend took me here for dinner and we enjoyed everything. The restaurant is very family style in terms of seating, which makes the place feel homey and welcoming. There are giant pig paintings on the walls. 

Our service was wonderful. Our waters got refilled very quickly, our plates and utensils got switched out after every plate, we got checked up on often, and when one of us went to the bathroom, our napkin would get refolded and placed nicely by the staff. 

We started out with the chef selection of oysters (6/$18). They came out with a little sheet that explained where they were from and their taste. My favorite are earthy west coast oysters. 

For shareable plates, we ordered the hamachi crudo, pork belly, and sirloin. The pork belly was so tender that you aren&apos;t even given a knife to cut it. It was amazing and melt in your mouth. If you don&apos;t like fatty pork belly, you will probably not like this. The hamachi crudo was very fresh, the calamansi vinegar gave it a nice kick. The dry aged sirloin was also quite good with the cashew butter. 

We finished off with some mead and goat/sheep cheese platter. I&apos;ll be coming back to try the brunch next time."
5,"My wife and I got a well earned getaway weekend for our 10th anniversary! We decided to check out a new place we&apos;d never been to before. I had heard from several others that this place was outstanding so we decided to make a reservation for 6pm on their patio.

They offered patio or indoor seating and with the current COVID-19 Protocols we felt better about being outside. We felt very comfortable as we sat under their heat lamps and had a nice romantic dinner.

We started with their bread, which was about $9. I&apos;d say it&apos;s on the better end of the spectrum but certainly not worth the money. I mean, it&apos;s bread! 

Next we had the apple salad which was outstanding. I&apos;m not a huge apple fan but their salad blended sweet with spicy and was just the best. Then we ordered scallops and pork belly and were mesmerized by both. We decided to share everything and didn&apos;t regret it as we enjoyed every single dish they brought out. 

I would highly recommend this place to those seeking a &quot;close to normal&quot; dining experience!"
5,"If Covid&apos;s got you down and you want an excellent date night out with perfect food &amp; beverage, this is THE spot. Safe &amp; socially distant, and the menu is outstanding. They execute to perfection.

Since I&apos;m thorough, below is what we had:

Two kinds of west coast oysters I&apos;ve never had from Samich Bay, Washington: Samich Pearl (left) and Penn Cove (right). These are both third best in my mind next to Kumamotos and Kusshis. Loved em! 

Steak tartare with some seriously amazing *perfect* seeded rye bread, fresno chili dijonaise and fried shallot.

Midwestern cheese plate with fresh chevre, brie, and an ash rind gooey cheese, fennel roasted candied cashews, apricot preserves, and sweet cherries.

Not pictured, a lovely glass of Spanish cava paired with the oysters and a glass of French bordeaux just because. Plus, my hubby&apos;s Westmalle Dubbel beer which was on draft. The place has an extensive Belgian beer list, a well curated wine list, and pretty cocktails. 

I think the intention there is to go there and stuff yourself full of fresh baked bread, meat, and Belgian beer, but really I felt myself being drawn toward the vegetarian dishes. They looked stellar. Next time!

Keep up the good work Publican, your servers are doing a phenomenal job!"
5,"*pre covid review* 

Hands down one of the best brunch places in the city. Their food is just great. If you are open to trying something new but that still feels like comfort food and is delicious then this is the spot. We usually come here for brunch and it is never repetitive. Their menu has a few staples (like their mouth watering, thick, and tender bacon) that don&apos;t change much and then their main dishes which rotate and change. I love that because it means that you are forced to try something different every time. It seems risky on their end but it allows them to remain creative with new dishes and I appreciate that. 
Aside from the amazing food, the staff is great and always attentive. They take reservations which is another reason why I love them but they do book up fairly quickly for brunch some times. 

Overall I love Publican and I highly recommend coming here for brunch or dinner!"
3,"Maybe it was because I came here for brunch but I had very high expectations for this place. Due to Covid, we reserved the prepaid seating in the outdoor igloos and had trouble ordering enough to fulfill the $50 each minimum. Each main dish was ~$15. We ordered the chicken and dumpling, publican scramble (spinach, crema, and crispy shallots), and the pork belly hash. All the food were a little too salty and fatty for my taste but the portions were decent. 

While the food was not very impressive, the drinks were delicious! The bourbon cream coffee and the pear hot toddy hit the spot especially on a cold morning dining outdoors. 

The service was a little a confusion. The waitstaff seemed to be in a rush, perhaps due to the pre-paid outdoor dining time limit and constantly checked to see if we were done with our food. 

However, I have heard good things about its dinner options and willing to try again!"
3,"First time here and first time doing the prepaid seating and our experience has been terrible so far. I understand there&apos;s a pandemic but that shouldn&apos;t be an excuse for a &quot;high end&quot; restaurant. They couldn&apos;t find our prepaid $45 reservations and they don&apos;t have 70% of the menu. We weren&apos;t told this until after we already sat down. I had 4 choices to pick from prior to my arrival and they don&apos;t have every single one of them. We had to rush to order and was completely off guard by the lack of choices. I heard raving reviews of this place and always wanted to give it a try. I support my local restaurants and businesses and this is not a good representation. I only have it 2 stars since they were somewhat accommodating to not being able to find our prepaid reservation and the mask policy is strictly enforced. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star.

Update: the server and manager were apologetic about our experience. Therefore, I upped it another star."
4,"Went for Sunday brunch on 11/22 in the igloos. Great staff, I mean stellar, excellent people. They provided recommendations, knew the menu (super important), and were honest - just down right awesome service. I was not a fan of the hash browns though. The menu literally says &quot;hash browns&quot; but they are deep fried in butter and they were very crispy like hard(maybe some people like that).  

The domes are not heated I would suggest dressing warm, and there is metered parking in walking distance. I loved the new branada toast (it&apos;s not avocado toast although it looks like it on Instagram). The chicken and dumplings were good, skillet looked good really can&apos;t go wrong."
5,"Had a fantastic experience at publican. Beer and wine list is so well rounded, truly something for everyone. We had the scallops, bread and fish dip, oysters, bbq carrots and charc plate. Everything was FANTASTIC! My fiancé a little bummed because ham plate was taken off of menu."
4,"Outdoor seating with translucent pods is a thing and it looks cool. This block of Fulton St is lined with them and you need to have your selfie taken here. 

The publican does comfort food right. By it self the dishes were fine taken as a whole, they take it up a notch. 

The farm chicken with au jus on a bed of French fries is having not only a savory and well seasoned bird but is like having poutine at the same time. The side sausage is good counter to the richness of the bird. By the way the dark meat is absolutely delicious.

The BBQ carrot tasted like meat carrot. It did not taste like a vegetable. Our server suggested the mussels which my wife and son really liked. The bread it came with was excellent. 

Fulton is now bougie - that comes with prices to match just be aware of that when you dine here."
4,"The Publican is a must visit in Chicago for brunch! And during COVID and indoor dining shutdown, they offer outdoor tent dining or individual bubble/ house dining (requires $150 deposit which is non-refundable and is applied towards your restaurant bill.) -- We did the tent and we&apos;re plenty warm. You can make reservations online, but we were able to get a table on Sunday in 45° weather without a reservation. The service was good and the food was delicious! I ordered a bourbon cream coffee which was a bit too bourbony for me, but I think bourbon lovers would go nuts for this! -- Will definitely be back to try more dishes!"
3,"We ate in one of the igloos- &quot;private domes&quot;- they are not heated. The reservation system says &quot;dine without the elements.&quot; You are in the elements when it is cold out, the description is quite misleading. The igloos also have an open flap which also lets a lot of heat escape. 
This should also be made clear when making a reservation and paying a non refundable $200 deposit. Overall food was great, naturally got cold fast but the courses were well spaced. The service was a bit slow especially for how few tables there were."

Definitely want to come again next time I&apos;m in town!"
5,"Delicious authentic Southern food from New Orleans in Chicago at the Publican. The cute, cozy, and safe dining experience in their private greenhouses. Make sure to dress warm and enjoy the experience."
5,"The ambience at The Publican is great for groups. I highly recommend making a reservation. They have communal seating so go in with the expectation that you might be seated at a table with strangers, but take advantage of it and have fun! I personally recommend the communal seating for large groups; for dates, request a booth for some more privacy and intimacy.

Dishes are family style, so I recommend ordering two dishes per person. I honestly enjoyed every dish that I ordered. The potted rillettes were my favourite. There was a great balance of savouriness and sweetness. The sourdough bread was smokey and had the right crispiness, adding texture to the dish.
The honeycrisp apple tartine was refreshing. It had a nice level of acidity that cut through the richness of another dish, the pork shank, that I had. The pork shank was tender. The sauce/jus was delicious with thin slices of mango in it.

I highly recommend The Publican. I would gladly come back to try some other dishes on the menu. I also look forward to going to another restaurant by Paul Kahan."
4,"Great food but VERY pricey for the portion sizes you get. The plates are meant to be shared between a few people but in my opinion, it was more like a plate for one (maybe I just eat too much). My boyfriend took me here for dinner and we enjoyed everything. The restaurant is very family style in terms of seating, which makes the place feel homey and welcoming. There are giant pig paintings on the walls. 

Our service was wonderful. Our waters got refilled very quickly, our plates and utensils got switched out after every plate, we got checked up on often, and when one of us went to the bathroom, our napkin would get refolded and placed nicely by the staff. 

We started out with the chef selection of oysters (6/$18). They came out with a little sheet that explained where they were from and their taste. My favorite are earthy west coast oysters. 

For shareable plates, we ordered the hamachi crudo, pork belly, and sirloin. The pork belly was so tender that you aren&apos;t even given a knife to cut it. It was amazing and melt in your mouth. If you don&apos;t like fatty pork belly, you will probably not like this. The hamachi crudo was very fresh, the calamansi vinegar gave it a nice kick. The dry aged sirloin was also quite good with the cashew butter. 

We finished off with some mead and goat/sheep cheese platter. I&apos;ll be coming back to try the brunch next time."
5,"My wife and I got a well earned getaway weekend for our 10th anniversary! We decided to check out a new place we&apos;d never been to before. I had heard from several others that this place was outstanding so we decided to make a reservation for 6pm on their patio.

They offered patio or indoor seating and with the current COVID-19 Protocols we felt better about being outside. We felt very comfortable as we sat under their heat lamps and had a nice romantic dinner.

We started with their bread, which was about $9. I&apos;d say it&apos;s on the better end of the spectrum but certainly not worth the money. I mean, it&apos;s bread! 

Next we had the apple salad which was outstanding. I&apos;m not a huge apple fan but their salad blended sweet with spicy and was just the best. Then we ordered scallops and pork belly and were mesmerized by both. We decided to share everything and didn&apos;t regret it as we enjoyed every single dish they brought out. 

I would highly recommend this place to those seeking a &quot;close to normal&quot; dining experience!"
5,"If Covid&apos;s got you down and you want an excellent date night out with perfect food &amp; beverage, this is THE spot. Safe &amp; socially distant, and the menu is outstanding. They execute to perfection.

Since I&apos;m thorough, below is what we had:

Two kinds of west coast oysters I&apos;ve never had from Samich Bay, Washington: Samich Pearl (left) and Penn Cove (right). These are both third best in my mind next to Kumamotos and Kusshis. Loved em! 

Steak tartare with some seriously amazing *perfect* seeded rye bread, fresno chili dijonaise and fried shallot.

Midwestern cheese plate with fresh chevre, brie, and an ash rind gooey cheese, fennel roasted candied cashews, apricot preserves, and sweet cherries.

Not pictured, a lovely glass of Spanish cava paired with the oysters and a glass of French bordeaux just because. Plus, my hubby&apos;s Westmalle Dubbel beer which was on draft. The place has an extensive Belgian beer list, a well curated wine list, and pretty cocktails. 

I think the intention there is to go there and stuff yourself full of fresh baked bread, meat, and Belgian beer, but really I felt myself being drawn toward the vegetarian dishes. They looked stellar. Next time!

Keep up the good work Publican, your servers are doing a phenomenal job!"
5,"*pre covid review* 

Hands down one of the best brunch places in the city. Their food is just great. If you are open to trying something new but that still feels like comfort food and is delicious then this is the spot. We usually come here for brunch and it is never repetitive. Their menu has a few staples (like their mouth watering, thick, and tender bacon) that don&apos;t change much and then their main dishes which rotate and change. I love that because it means that you are forced to try something different every time. It seems risky on their end but it allows them to remain creative with new dishes and I appreciate that. 
Aside from the amazing food, the staff is great and always attentive. They take reservations which is another reason why I love them but they do book up fairly quickly for brunch some times. 

Overall I love Publican and I highly recommend coming here for brunch or dinner!"
3,"Maybe it was because I came here for brunch but I had very high expectations for this place. Due to Covid, we reserved the prepaid seating in the outdoor igloos and had trouble ordering enough to fulfill the $50 each minimum. Each main dish was ~$15. We ordered the chicken and dumpling, publican scramble (spinach, crema, and crispy shallots), and the pork belly hash. All the food were a little too salty and fatty for my taste but the portions were decent. 

While the food was not very impressive, the drinks were delicious! The bourbon cream coffee and the pear hot toddy hit the spot especially on a cold morning dining outdoors. 

The service was a little a confusion. The waitstaff seemed to be in a rush, perhaps due to the pre-paid outdoor dining time limit and constantly checked to see if we were done with our food. 

However, I have heard good things about its dinner options and willing to try again!"
3,"First time here and first time doing the prepaid seating and our experience has been terrible so far. I understand there&apos;s a pandemic but that shouldn&apos;t be an excuse for a &quot;high end&quot; restaurant. They couldn&apos;t find our prepaid $45 reservations and they don&apos;t have 70% of the menu. We weren&apos;t told this until after we already sat down. I had 4 choices to pick from prior to my arrival and they don&apos;t have every single one of them. We had to rush to order and was completely off guard by the lack of choices. I heard raving reviews of this place and always wanted to give it a try. I support my local restaurants and businesses and this is not a good representation. I only have it 2 stars since they were somewhat accommodating to not being able to find our prepaid reservation and the mask policy is strictly enforced. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star.

Update: the server and manager were apologetic about our experience. Therefore, I upped it another star."
4,"Went for Sunday brunch on 11/22 in the igloos. Great staff, I mean stellar, excellent people. They provided recommendations, knew the menu (super important), and were honest - just down right awesome service. I was not a fan of the hash browns though. The menu literally says &quot;hash browns&quot; but they are deep fried in butter and they were very crispy like hard(maybe some people like that).  

The domes are not heated I would suggest dressing warm, and there is metered parking in walking distance. I loved the new branada toast (it&apos;s not avocado toast although it looks like it on Instagram). The chicken and dumplings were good, skillet looked good really can&apos;t go wrong."
5,"Had a fantastic experience at publican. Beer and wine list is so well rounded, truly something for everyone. We had the scallops, bread and fish dip, oysters, bbq carrots and charc plate. Everything was FANTASTIC! My fiancé a little bummed because ham plate was taken off of menu."
4,"Outdoor seating with translucent pods is a thing and it looks cool. This block of Fulton St is lined with them and you need to have your selfie taken here. 

The publican does comfort food right. By it self the dishes were fine taken as a whole, they take it up a notch. 

The farm chicken with au jus on a bed of French fries is having not only a savory and well seasoned bird but is like having poutine at the same time. The side sausage is good counter to the richness of the bird. By the way the dark meat is absolutely delicious.

The BBQ carrot tasted like meat carrot. It did not taste like a vegetable. Our server suggested the mussels which my wife and son really liked. The bread it came with was excellent. 

Fulton is now bougie - that comes with prices to match just be aware of that when you dine here."
4,"The Publican is a must visit in Chicago for brunch! And during COVID and indoor dining shutdown, they offer outdoor tent dining or individual bubble/ house dining (requires $150 deposit which is non-refundable and is applied towards your restaurant bill.) -- We did the tent and we&apos;re plenty warm. You can make reservations online, but we were able to get a table on Sunday in 45° weather without a reservation. The service was good and the food was delicious! I ordered a bourbon cream coffee which was a bit too bourbony for me, but I think bourbon lovers would go nuts for this! -- Will definitely be back to try more dishes!"
3,"We ate in one of the igloos- &quot;private domes&quot;- they are not heated. The reservation system says &quot;dine without the elements.&quot; You are in the elements when it is cold out, the description is quite misleading. The igloos also have an open flap which also lets a lot of heat escape. 
This should also be made clear when making a reservation and paying a non refundable $200 deposit. Overall food was great, naturally got cold fast but the courses were well spaced. The service was a bit slow especially for how few tables there were."
1,"Terrible service.No hospitality.
We booked the weekend brunch and when we arrived we had to wait a lot until seated then waited again for the order...and again when checking out.our server was cold and showed no hospitality.
There was a lot of trashes around our outdoor seating.
Very, very unpleasant.
Our server told us that  waffle and schnitzel were unavailable, at the timing of ordering , but he should have informed us before...
And food was also average, blunt, no surprise.
Just very much pricey for their portion.
And they charged us full price though we already put $30 in advance , when we booked online...so we had to ask the server to correct it.
Never come back."
5,"Let&apos;s shine a spotlight on another restaurant that has been truly amazing during the pandemic. 

First, the food is great, even if you don&apos;t order pork. The roast chicken is delicious, with a nicely salty sauce that goes perfectly on their fries, and the sides are interesting, textured, satisfying, and creative. I&apos;m thinking of the bbq carrots with ranch sauce, the burrata with tons of veggies, etc. And the desserts - an important and tough test in my household - are superlative. 

Second, they deliver! To Hyde Park! I don&apos;t mind doing some curbside pickup when I have to, but with little kids at home and Chicago traffic being what it is, I award a huge premium to any place that will give me 30-60 minutes of my life back by delivering to my door. Down here in the ivory tower we don&apos;t have a ton of amazing delivery options. But Publican is one of them.

Third, the customer service goes above and beyond. We had planned out a great spread for a Friday night dinner. The spread arrived, but missing our roast chicken. Hamlet without the prince and all that. Many restaurants would have just apologized and refunded the chicken. But the Publican recognized that without the chicken, dinner was ruined. They rushed the chicken through the kitchen and packed it into an Uber Connect. It arrived before we were done with the first course, and saved the day. And on top of that, they added a loaf of the best Publican bread for free. And they STILL refunded the chicken. 

When I worry about whether the Chicago restaurant scene will survive the pandemic, I think: as long as places like the Publican survive, we will be ok."
4,"Great local food on the main drag on Fulton&apos;s restaurant row. They offer &quot;greenhouse&quot; private dining pods outside with a min. Purchase deposit, which we found quite nice and intimate and well as safe from COVID. Food is to be shared amongst guests and doesn&apos;t come out as a meal but more like tapas. We tried the homemade bread, mussels, shrimp, and scallops- all with lots of fresh herbs and tons of flavor."
4,"We had a really great time here. Beer was great, oysters were great, the bread and dip trio was great! The pork belly for me was just OK and the service also seemed a tiny bit lacking, but overall super glad we decided to make reservations here."
5,"Gotta call in advance and reserve you spot. Decided to check this place out after watching this show called , F*ck that&apos;s delicious, and oh my it really is !!!! We ordered the soft shell crab, oysters and pork belly and frites. That was enough for 2 people. Ambience was nice on a busy Friday night During the pandemic.. but they were extra careful and did what they need to do to make sure everyone stays safe. Really love the food here and can&apos;t wait to come back."
4,"This place is not cheap, but it is ideal for special occasions. 

We started with oysters and a cheese plate, which set the tone for my excellent scallops."
5,"Loved having brunch here!

Since I&apos;m thorough, below is what we had:

Two kinds of west coast oysters I&apos;ve never had from Samich Bay, Washington: Samich Pearl (left) and Penn Cove (right). These are both third best in my mind next to Kumamotos and Kusshis. Loved em! 

Steak tartare with some seriously amazing *perfect* seeded rye bread, fresno chili dijonaise and fried shallot.

Midwestern cheese plate with fresh chevre, brie, and an ash rind gooey cheese, fennel roasted candied cashews, apricot preserves, and sweet cherries.

Not pictured, a lovely glass of Spanish cava paired with the oysters and a glass of French bordeaux just because. Plus, my hubby&apos;s Westmalle Dubbel beer which was on draft. The place has an extensive Belgian beer list, a well curated wine list, and pretty cocktails. 

I think the intention there is to go there and stuff yourself full of fresh baked bread, meat, and Belgian beer, but really I felt myself being drawn toward the vegetarian dishes. They looked stellar. Next time!

Keep up the good work Publican, your servers are doing a phenomenal job!"
5,"*pre covid review* 

Hands down one of the best brunch places in the city. Their food is just great. If you are open to trying something new but that still feels like comfort food and is delicious then this is the spot. We usually come here for brunch and it is never repetitive. Their menu has a few staples (like their mouth watering, thick, and tender bacon) that don&apos;t change much and then their main dishes which rotate and change. I love that because it means that you are forced to try something different every time. It seems risky on their end but it allows them to remain creative with new dishes and I appreciate that. 
Aside from the amazing food, the staff is great and always attentive. They take reservations which is another reason why I love them but they do book up fairly quickly for brunch some times. 

Overall I love Publican and I highly recommend coming here for brunch or dinner!"
3,"Maybe it was because I came here for brunch but I had very high expectations for this place. Due to Covid, we reserved the prepaid seating in the outdoor igloos and had trouble ordering enough to fulfill the $50 each minimum. Each main dish was ~$15. We ordered the chicken and dumpling, publican scramble (spinach, crema, and crispy shallots), and the pork belly hash. All the food were a little too salty and fatty for my taste but the portions were decent. 

While the food was not very impressive, the drinks were delicious! The bourbon cream coffee and the pear hot toddy hit the spot especially on a cold morning dining outdoors. 

The service was a little a confusion. The waitstaff seemed to be in a rush, perhaps due to the pre-paid outdoor dining time limit and constantly checked to see if we were done with our food. 

However, I have heard good things about its dinner options and willing to try again!"
3,"First time here and first time doing the prepaid seating and our experience has been terrible so far. I understand there&apos;s a pandemic but that shouldn&apos;t be an excuse for a &quot;high end&quot; restaurant. They couldn&apos;t find our prepaid $45 reservations and they don&apos;t have 70% of the menu. We weren&apos;t told this until after we already sat down. I had 4 choices to pick from prior to my arrival and they don&apos;t have every single one of them. We had to rush to order and was completely off guard by the lack of choices. I heard raving reviews of this place and always wanted to give it a try. I support my local restaurants and businesses and this is not a good representation. I only have it 2 stars since they were somewhat accommodating to not being able to find our prepaid reservation and the mask policy is strictly enforced. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star.

Update: the server and manager were apologetic about our experience. Therefore, I upped it another star."
4,"Went for Sunday brunch on 11/22 in the igloos. Great staff, I mean stellar, excellent people. They provided recommendations, knew the menu (super important), and were honest - just down right awesome service. I was not a fan of the hash browns though. The menu literally says &quot;hash browns&quot; but they are deep fried in butter and they were very crispy like hard(maybe some people like that).  

The domes are not heated I would suggest dressing warm, and there is metered parking in walking distance. I loved the new branada toast (it&apos;s not avocado toast although it looks like it on Instagram). The chicken and dumplings were good, skillet looked good really can&apos;t go wrong."
5,"Had a fantastic experience at publican. Beer and wine list is so well rounded, truly something for everyone. We had the scallops, bread and fish dip, oysters, bbq carrots and charc plate. Everything was FANTASTIC! My fiancé a little bummed because ham plate was taken off of menu."
4,"Outdoor seating with translucent pods is a thing and it looks cool. This block of Fulton St is lined with them and you need to have your selfie taken here. 

The publican does comfort food right. By it self the dishes were fine taken as a whole, they take it up a notch. 

The farm chicken with au jus on a bed of French fries is having not only a savory and well seasoned bird but is like having poutine at the same time. The side sausage is good counter to the richness of the bird. By the way the dark meat is absolutely delicious.

The BBQ carrot tasted like meat carrot. It did not taste like a vegetable. Our server suggested the mussels which my wife and son really liked. The bread it came with was excellent. 

Fulton is now bougie - that comes with prices to match just be aware of that when you dine here."
4,"The Publican is a must visit in Chicago for brunch! And during COVID and indoor dining shutdown, they offer outdoor tent dining or individual bubble/ house dining (requires $150 deposit which is non-refundable and is applied towards your restaurant bill.) -- We did the tent and we&apos;re plenty warm. You can make reservations online, but we were able to get a table on Sunday in 45° weather without a reservation. The service was good and the food was delicious! I ordered a bourbon cream coffee which was a bit too bourbony for me, but I think bourbon lovers would go nuts for this! -- Will definitely be back to try more dishes!"
3,"We ate in one of the igloos- &quot;private domes&quot;- they are not heated. The reservation system says &quot;dine without the elements.&quot; You are in the elements when it is cold out, the description is quite misleading. The igloos also have an open flap which also lets a lot of heat escape. 
This should also be made clear when making a reservation and paying a non refundable $200 deposit. Overall food was great, naturally got cold fast but the courses were well spaced. The service was a bit slow especially for how few tables there were."
1,"Terrible service.No hospitality.
We booked the weekend brunch and when we arrived we had to wait a lot until seated then waited again for the order...and again when checking out.our server was cold and showed no hospitality.
There was a lot of trashes around our outdoor seating.
Very, very unpleasant.
Our server told us that  waffle and schnitzel were unavailable, at the timing of ordering , but he should have informed us before...
And food was also average, blunt, no surprise.
Just very much pricey for their portion.
And they charged us full price though we already put $30 in advance , when we booked online...so we had to ask the server to correct it.
Never come back."
5,"Let&apos;s shine a spotlight on another restaurant that has been truly amazing during the pandemic. 

First, the food is great, even if you don&apos;t order pork. The roast chicken is delicious, with a nicely salty sauce that goes perfectly on their fries, and the sides are interesting, textured, satisfying, and creative. I&apos;m thinking of the bbq carrots with ranch sauce, the burrata with tons of veggies, etc. And the desserts - an important and tough test in my household - are superlative. 

Second, they deliver! To Hyde Park! I don&apos;t mind doing some curbside pickup when I have to, but with little kids at home and Chicago traffic being what it is, I award a huge premium to any place that will give me 30-60 minutes of my life back by delivering to my door. Down here in the ivory tower we don&apos;t have a ton of amazing delivery options. But Publican is one of them.

Third, the customer service goes above and beyond. We had planned out a great spread for a Friday night dinner. The spread arrived, but missing our roast chicken. Hamlet without the prince and all that. Many restaurants would have just apologized and refunded the chicken. But the Publican recognized that without the chicken, dinner was ruined. They rushed the chicken through the kitchen and packed it into an Uber Connect. It arrived before we were done with the first course, and saved the day. And on top of that, they added a loaf of the best Publican bread for free. And they STILL refunded the chicken. 

When I worry about whether the Chicago restaurant scene will survive the pandemic, I think: as long as places like the Publican survive, we will be ok."
4,"Great local food on the main drag on Fulton&apos;s restaurant row. They offer &quot;greenhouse&quot; private dining pods outside with a min. Purchase deposit, which we found quite nice and intimate and well as safe from COVID. Food is to be shared amongst guests and doesn&apos;t come out as a meal but more like tapas. We tried the homemade bread, mussels, shrimp, and scallops- all with lots of fresh herbs and tons of flavor."
4,"We had a really great time here. Beer was great, oysters were great, the bread and dip trio was great! The pork belly for me was just OK and the service also seemed a tiny bit lacking, but overall super glad we decided to make reservations here."
5,"Gotta call in advance and reserve you spot. Decided to check this place out after watching this show called , F*ck that&apos;s delicious, and oh my it really is !!!! We ordered the soft shell crab, oysters and pork belly and frites. That was enough for 2 people. Ambience was nice on a busy Friday night During the pandemic.. but they were extra careful and did what they need to do to make sure everyone stays safe. Really love the food here and can&apos;t wait to come back."
4,"This place is not cheap, but it is ideal for special occasions. 

We started with oysters and a cheese plate, which set the tone for my excellent scallops."
5,"Loved having brunch here! 
Their Covid precautions were well organized and clean. 

The food was amazing! The pork belly was so crispy, chewy, and flavorful. The Biscuit Sandwich with Flank Steak was also a great meal that hit the spot. The different ingredients and condiments in the sandwich complimented each other so well! My favorite was the Belgian waffle. It was so light and crispy, yet was still chewy and so delicious. The jam and butter that came with it was also the perfect complement to the syrup!

Definitely want to come again next time I&apos;m in town!"
5,"Delicious authentic Southern food from New Orleans in Chicago at the Publican. The cute, cozy, and safe dining experience in their private greenhouses. Make sure to dress warm and enjoy the experience."
5,"The ambience at The Publican is great for groups. I highly recommend making a reservation. They have communal seating so go in with the expectation that you might be seated at a table with strangers, but take advantage of it and have fun! I personally recommend the communal seating for large groups; for dates, request a booth for some more privacy and intimacy.

Dishes are family style, so I recommend ordering two dishes per person. I honestly enjoyed every dish that I ordered. The potted rillettes were my favourite. There was a great balance of savouriness and sweetness. The sourdough bread was smokey and had the right crispiness, adding texture to the dish.
The honeycrisp apple tartine was refreshing. It had a nice level of acidity that cut through the richness of another dish, the pork shank, that I had. The pork shank was tender. The sauce/jus was delicious with thin slices of mango in it.

I highly recommend The Publican. I would gladly come back to try some other dishes on the menu. I also look forward to going to another restaurant by Paul Kahan."
4,"Great food but VERY pricey for the portion sizes you get. The plates are meant to be shared between a few people but in my opinion, it was more like a plate for one (maybe I just eat too much). My boyfriend took me here for dinner and we enjoyed everything. The restaurant is very family style in terms of seating, which makes the place feel homey and welcoming. There are giant pig paintings on the walls. 

Our service was wonderful. Our waters got refilled very quickly, our plates and utensils got switched out after every plate, we got checked up on often, and when one of us went to the bathroom, our napkin would get refolded and placed nicely by the staff. 

We started out with the chef selection of oysters (6/$18). They came out with a little sheet that explained where they were from and their taste. My favorite are earthy west coast oysters. 

For shareable plates, we ordered the hamachi crudo, pork belly, and sirloin. The pork belly was so tender that you aren&apos;t even given a knife to cut it. It was amazing and melt in your mouth. If you don&apos;t like fatty pork belly, you will probably not like this. The hamachi crudo was very fresh, the calamansi vinegar gave it a nice kick. The dry aged sirloin was also quite good with the cashew butter. 

We finished off with some mead and goat/sheep cheese platter. I&apos;ll be coming back to try the brunch next time."
5,"My wife and I got a well earned getaway weekend for our 10th anniversary! We decided to check out a new place we&apos;d never been to before. I had heard from several others that this place was outstanding so we decided to make a reservation for 6pm on their patio.

They offered patio or indoor seating and with the current COVID-19 Protocols we felt better about being outside. We felt very comfortable as we sat under their heat lamps and had a nice romantic dinner.

We started with their bread, which was about $9. I&apos;d say it&apos;s on the better end of the spectrum but certainly not worth the money. I mean, it&apos;s bread! 

Next we had the apple salad which was outstanding. I&apos;m not a huge apple fan but their salad blended sweet with spicy and was just the best. Then we ordered scallops and pork belly and were mesmerized by both. We decided to share everything and didn&apos;t regret it as we enjoyed every single dish they brought out. 

I would highly recommend this place to those seeking a &quot;close to normal&quot; dining experience!"

4,"Went for Sunday brunch on 11/22 in the igloos. Great staff, I mean stellar, excellent people. They provided recommendations, knew the menu (super important), and were honest - just down right awesome service. I was not a fan of the hash browns though. The menu literally says &quot;hash browns&quot; but they are deep fried in butter and they were very crispy like hard(maybe some people like that).  

The domes are not heated I would suggest dressing warm, and there is metered parking in walking distance. I loved the new branada toast (it&apos;s not avocado toast although it looks like it on Instagram). The chicken and dumplings were good, skillet looked good really can&apos;t go wrong."
5,"Had a fantastic experience at publican. Beer and wine list is so well rounded, truly something for everyone. We had the scallops, bread and fish dip, oysters, bbq carrots and charc plate. Everything was FANTASTIC! My fiancé a little bummed because ham plate was taken off of menu."
4,"Outdoor seating with translucent pods is a thing and it looks cool. This block of Fulton St is lined with them and you need to have your selfie taken here. 

The publican does comfort food right. By it self the dishes were fine taken as a whole, they take it up a notch. 

The farm chicken with au jus on a bed of French fries is having not only a savory and well seasoned bird but is like having poutine at the same time. The side sausage is good counter to the richness of the bird. By the way the dark meat is absolutely delicious.

The BBQ carrot tasted like meat carrot. It did not taste like a vegetable. Our server suggested the mussels which my wife and son really liked. The bread it came with was excellent. 

Fulton is now bougie - that comes with prices to match just be aware of that when you dine here."
4,"The Publican is a must visit in Chicago for brunch! And during COVID and indoor dining shutdown, they offer outdoor tent dining or individual bubble/ house dining (requires $150 deposit which is non-refundable and is applied towards your restaurant bill.) -- We did the tent and we&apos;re plenty warm. You can make reservations online, but we were able to get a table on Sunday in 45° weather without a reservation. The service was good and the food was delicious! I ordered a bourbon cream coffee which was a bit too bourbony for me, but I think bourbon lovers would go nuts for this! -- Will definitely be back to try more dishes!"
3,"We ate in one of the igloos- &quot;private domes&quot;- they are not heated. The reservation system says &quot;dine without the elements.&quot; You are in the elements when it is cold out, the description is quite misleading. The igloos also have an open flap which also lets a lot of heat escape. 
This should also be made clear when making a reservation and paying a non refundable $200 deposit. Overall food was great, naturally got cold fast but the courses were well spaced. The service was a bit slow especially for how few tables there were."
1,"Terrible service.No hospitality.
We booked the weekend brunch and when we arrived we had to wait a lot until seated then waited again for the order...and again when checking out.our server was cold and showed no hospitality.
There was a lot of trashes around our outdoor seating.
Very, very unpleasant.
Our server told us that  waffle and schnitzel were unavailable, at the timing of ordering , but he should have informed us before...
And food was also average, blunt, no surprise.
Just very much pricey for their portion.
And they charged us full price though we already put $30 in advance , when we booked online...so we had to ask the server to correct it.
Never come back."
5,"Let&apos;s shine a spotlight on another restaurant that has been truly amazing during the pandemic. 

First, the food is great, even if you don&apos;t order pork. The roast chicken is delicious, with a nicely salty sauce that goes perfectly on their fries, and the sides are interesting, textured, satisfying, and creative. I&apos;m thinking of the bbq carrots with ranch sauce, the burrata with tons of veggies, etc. And the desserts - an important and tough test in my household - are superlative. 

Second, they deliver! To Hyde Park! I don&apos;t mind doing some curbside pickup when I have to, but with little kids at home and Chicago traffic being what it is, I award a huge premium to any place that will give me 30-60 minutes of my life back by delivering to my door. Down here in the ivory tower we don&apos;t have a ton of amazing delivery options. But Publican is one of them.

Third, the customer service goes above and beyond. We had planned out a great spread for a Friday night dinner. The spread arrived, but missing our roast chicken. Hamlet without the prince and all that. Many restaurants would have just apologized and refunded the chicken. But the Publican recognized that without the chicken, dinner was ruined. They rushed the chicken through the kitchen and packed it into an Uber Connect. It arrived before we were done with the first course, and saved the day. And on top of that, they added a loaf of the best Publican bread for free. And they STILL refunded the chicken. 

When I worry about whether the Chicago restaurant scene will survive the pandemic, I think: as long as places like the Publican survive, we will be ok."
4,"Great local food on the main drag on Fulton&apos;s restaurant row. They offer &quot;greenhouse&quot; private dining pods outside with a min. Purchase deposit, which we found quite nice and intimate and well as safe from COVID. Food is to be shared amongst guests and doesn&apos;t come out as a meal but more like tapas. We tried the homemade bread, mussels, shrimp, and scallops- all with lots of fresh herbs and tons of flavor."
4,"We had a really great time here. Beer was great, oysters were great, the bread and dip trio was great! The pork belly for me was just OK and the service also seemed a tiny bit lacking, but overall super glad we decided to make reservations here."
5,"Gotta call in advance and reserve you spot. Decided to check this place out after watching this show called , F*ck that&apos;s delicious, and oh my it really is !!!! We ordered the soft shell crab, oysters and pork belly and frites. That was enough for 2 people. Ambience was nice on a busy Friday night During the pandemic.. but they were extra careful and did what they need to do to make sure everyone stays safe. Really love the food here and can&apos;t wait to come back."
4,"This place is not cheap, but it is ideal for special occasions. 

We started with oysters and a cheese plate, which set the tone for my excellent scallops."
5,"Loved having brunch here! 
Their Covid precautions were well organized and clean. 

The food was amazing! The pork belly was so crispy, chewy, and flavorful. The Biscuit Sandwich with Flank Steak was also a great meal that hit the spot. The different ingredients and condiments in the sandwich complimented each other so well! My favorite was the Belgian waffle. It was so light and crispy, yet was still chewy and so delicious. The jam and butter that came with it was also the perfect complement to the syrup!

Definitely want to come again next time I&apos;m in town!"
5,"Delicious authentic Southern food from New Orleans in Chicago at the Publican. The cute, cozy, and safe dining experience in their private greenhouses. Make sure to dress warm and enjoy the experience."
5,"The ambience at The Publican is great for groups. I highly recommend making a reservation. They have communal seating so go in with the expectation that you might be seated at a table with strangers, but take advantage of it and have fun! I personally recommend the communal seating for large groups; for dates, request a booth for some more privacy and intimacy.

Dishes are family style, so I recommend ordering two dishes per person. I honestly enjoyed every dish that I ordered. The potted rillettes were my favourite. There was a great balance of savouriness and sweetness. The sourdough bread was smokey and had the right crispiness, adding texture to the dish.
The honeycrisp apple tartine was refreshing. It had a nice level of acidity that cut through the richness of another dish, the pork shank, that I had. The pork shank was tender. The sauce/jus was delicious with thin slices of mango in it.

I highly recommend The Publican. I would gladly come back to try some other dishes on the menu. I also look forward to going to another restaurant by Paul Kahan."
4,"Great food but VERY pricey for the portion sizes you get. The plates are meant to be shared between a few people but in my opinion, it was more like a plate for one (maybe I just eat too much). My boyfriend took me here for dinner and we enjoyed everything. The restaurant is very family style in terms of seating, which makes the place feel homey and welcoming. There are giant pig paintings on the walls. 

Our service was wonderful. Our waters got refilled very quickly, our plates and utensils got switched out after every plate, we got checked up on often, and when one of us went to the bathroom, our napkin would get refolded and placed nicely by the staff. 

We started out with the chef selection of oysters (6/$18). They came out with a little sheet that explained where they were from and their taste. My favorite are earthy west coast oysters. 

For shareable plates, we ordered the hamachi crudo, pork belly, and sirloin. The pork belly was so tender that you aren&apos;t even given a knife to cut it. It was amazing and melt in your mouth. If you don&apos;t like fatty pork belly, you will probably not like this. The hamachi crudo was very fresh, the calamansi vinegar gave it a nice kick. The dry aged sirloin was also quite good with the cashew butter. 

We finished off with some mead and goat/sheep cheese platter. I&apos;ll be coming back to try the brunch next time."
5,"My wife and I got a well earned getaway weekend for our 10th anniversary! We decided to check out a new place we&apos;d never been to before. I had heard from several others that this place was outstanding so we decided to make a reservation for 6pm on their patio.

They offered patio or indoor seating and with the current COVID-19 Protocols we felt better about being outside. We felt very comfortable as we sat under their heat lamps and had a nice romantic dinner.

We started with their bread, which was about $9. I&apos;d say it&apos;s on the better end of the spectrum but certainly not worth the money. I mean, it&apos;s bread! 

Next we had the apple salad which was outstanding. I&apos;m not a huge apple fan but their salad blended sweet with spicy and was just the best. Then we ordered scallops and pork belly and were mesmerized by both. We decided to share everything and didn&apos;t regret it as we enjoyed every single dish they brought out. 

I would highly recommend this place to those seeking a &quot;close to normal&quot; dining experience!"
5,"If Covid&apos;s got you down and you want an excellent date night out with perfect food &amp; beverage, this is THE spot. Safe &amp; socially distant, and the menu is outstanding. They execute to perfection.

Since I&apos;m thorough, below is what we had:

Two kinds of west coast oysters I&apos;ve never had from Samich Bay, Washington: Samich Pearl (left) and Penn Cove (right). These are both third best in my mind next to Kumamotos and Kusshis. Loved em! 

Steak tartare with some seriously amazing *perfect* seeded rye bread, fresno chili dijonaise and fried shallot.

Midwestern cheese plate with fresh chevre, brie, and an ash rind gooey cheese, fennel roasted candied cashews, apricot preserves, and sweet cherries.

Not pictured, a lovely glass of Spanish cava paired with the oysters and a glass of French bordeaux just because. Plus, my hubby&apos;s Westmalle Dubbel beer which was on draft. The place has an extensive Belgian beer list, a well curated wine list, and pretty cocktails. 

I think the intention there is to go there and stuff yourself full of fresh baked bread, meat, and Belgian beer, but really I felt myself being drawn toward the vegetarian dishes. They looked stellar. Next time!

Keep up the good work Publican, your servers are doing a phenomenal job!"
5,"*pre covid review* 

Hands down one of the best brunch places in the city. Their food is just great. If you are open to trying something new but that still feels like comfort food and is delicious then this is the spot. We usually come here for brunch and it is never repetitive. Their menu has a few staples (like their mouth watering, thick, and tender bacon) that don&apos;t change much and then their main dishes which rotate and change. I love that because it means that you are forced to try something different every time. It seems risky on their end but it allows them to remain creative with new dishes and I appreciate that. 
Aside from the amazing food, the staff is great and always attentive. They take reservations which is another reason why I love them but they do book up fairly quickly for brunch some times. 

Overall I love Publican and I highly recommend coming here for brunch or dinner!"
3,"Maybe it was because I came here for brunch but I had very high expectations for this place. Due to Covid, we reserved the prepaid seating in the outdoor igloos and had trouble ordering enough to fulfill the $50 each minimum. Each main dish was ~$15. We ordered the chicken and dumpling, publican scramble (spinach, crema, and crispy shallots), and the pork belly hash. All the food were a little too salty and fatty for my taste but the portions were decent. 

While the food was not very impressive, the drinks were delicious! The bourbon cream coffee and the pear hot toddy hit the spot especially on a cold morning dining outdoors. 

The service was a little a confusion. The waitstaff seemed to be in a rush, perhaps due to the pre-paid outdoor dining time limit and constantly checked to see if we were done with our food. 

However, I have heard good things about its dinner options and willing to try again!"
3,"First time here and first time doing the prepaid seating and our experience has been terrible so far. I understand there&apos;s a pandemic but that shouldn&apos;t be an excuse for a &quot;high end&quot; restaurant. They couldn&apos;t find our prepaid $45 reservations and they don&apos;t have 70% of the menu. We weren&apos;t told this until after we already sat down. I had 4 choices to pick from prior to my arrival and they don&apos;t have every single one of them. We had to rush to order and was completely off guard by the lack of choices. I heard raving reviews of this place and always wanted to give it a try. I support my local restaurants and businesses and this is not a good representation. I only have it 2 stars since they were somewhat accommodating to not being able to find our prepaid reservation and the mask policy is strictly enforced. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star.

The roast chicken is delicious, with a nicely salty sauce that goes perfectly on their fries, and the sides are interesting, textured, satisfying, and creative. I&apos;m thinking of the bbq carrots with ranch sauce, the burrata with tons of veggies, etc. And the desserts - an important and tough test in my household - are superlative. 

Second, they deliver! To Hyde Park! I don&apos;t mind doing some curbside pickup when I have to, but with little kids at home and Chicago traffic being what it is, I award a huge premium to any place that will give me 30-60 minutes of my life back by delivering to my door. Down here in the ivory tower we don&apos;t have a ton of amazing delivery options. But Publican is one of them.

Third, the customer service goes above and beyond. We had planned out a great spread for a Friday night dinner. The spread arrived, but missing our roast chicken. Hamlet without the prince and all that. Many restaurants would have just apologized and refunded the chicken. But the Publican recognized that without the chicken, dinner was ruined. They rushed the chicken through the kitchen and packed it into an Uber Connect. It arrived before we were done with the first course, and saved the day. And on top of that, they added a loaf of the best Publican bread for free. And they STILL refunded the chicken. 

When I worry about whether the Chicago restaurant scene will survive the pandemic, I think: as long as places like the Publican survive, we will be ok."
4,"Great local food on the main drag on Fulton&apos;s restaurant row. They offer &quot;greenhouse&quot; private dining pods outside with a min. Purchase deposit, which we found quite nice and intimate and well as safe from COVID. Food is to be shared amongst guests and doesn&apos;t come out as a meal but more like tapas. We tried the homemade bread, mussels, shrimp, and scallops- all with lots of fresh herbs and tons of flavor."
4,"We had a really great time here. Beer was great, oysters were great, the bread and dip trio was great! The pork belly for me was just OK and the service also seemed a tiny bit lacking, but overall super glad we decided to make reservations here."
5,"Gotta call in advance and reserve you spot. Decided to check this place out after watching this show called , F*ck that&apos;s delicious, and oh my it really is !!!! We ordered the soft shell crab, oysters and pork belly and frites. That was enough for 2 people. Ambience was nice on a busy Friday night During the pandemic.. but they were extra careful and did what they need to do to make sure everyone stays safe. Really love the food here and can&apos;t wait to come back."
4,"This place is not cheap, but it is ideal for special occasions. 

We started with oysters and a cheese plate, which set the tone for my excellent scallops."
5,"Loved having brunch here! 
Their Covid precautions were well organized and clean. 

The food was amazing! The pork belly was so crispy, chewy, and flavorful. The Biscuit Sandwich with Flank Steak was also a great meal that hit the spot. The different ingredients and condiments in the sandwich complimented each other so well! My favorite was the Belgian waffle. It was so light and crispy, yet was still chewy and so delicious. The jam and butter that came with it was also the perfect complement to the syrup!

Definitely want to come again next time I&apos;m in town!"
5,"Delicious authentic Southern food from New Orleans in Chicago at the Publican. The cute, cozy, and safe dining experience in their private greenhouses. Make sure to dress warm and enjoy the experience."
5,"The ambience at The Publican is great for groups. I highly recommend making a reservation. They have communal seating so go in with the expectation that you might be seated at a table with strangers, but take advantage of it and have fun! I personally recommend the communal seating for large groups; for dates, request a booth for some more privacy and intimacy.

Dishes are family style, so I recommend ordering two dishes per person. I honestly enjoyed every dish that I ordered. The potted rillettes were my favourite. There was a great balance of savouriness and sweetness. The sourdough bread was smokey and had the right crispiness, adding texture to the dish.
The honeycrisp apple tartine was refreshing. It had a nice level of acidity that cut through the richness of another dish, the pork shank, that I had. The pork shank was tender. The sauce/jus was delicious with thin slices of mango in it.

I highly recommend The Publican. I would gladly come back to try some other dishes on the menu. I also look forward to going to another restaurant by Paul Kahan."
4,"Great food but VERY pricey for the portion sizes you get. The plates are meant to be shared between a few people but in my opinion, it was more like a plate for one (maybe I just eat too much). My boyfriend took me here for dinner and we enjoyed everything. The restaurant is very family style in terms of seating, which makes the place feel homey and welcoming. There are giant pig paintings on the walls. 

Our service was wonderful. Our waters got refilled very quickly, our plates and utensils got switched out after every plate, we got checked up on often, and when one of us went to the bathroom, our napkin would get refolded and placed nicely by the staff. 

We started out with the chef selection of oysters (6/$18). They came out with a little sheet that explained where they were from and their taste. My favorite are earthy west coast oysters. 

For shareable plates, we ordered the hamachi crudo, pork belly, and sirloin. The pork belly was so tender that you aren&apos;t even given a knife to cut it. It was amazing and melt in your mouth. If you don&apos;t like fatty pork belly, you will probably not like this. The hamachi crudo was very fresh, the calamansi vinegar gave it a nice kick. The dry aged sirloin was also quite good with the cashew butter. 

We finished off with some mead and goat/sheep cheese platter. I&apos;ll be coming back to try the brunch next time."
5,"My wife and I got a well earned getaway weekend for our 10th anniversary! We decided to check out a new place we&apos;d never been to before. I had heard from several others that this place was outstanding so we decided to make a reservation for 6pm on their patio.

They offered patio or indoor seating and with the current COVID-19 Protocols we felt better about being outside. We felt very comfortable as we sat under their heat lamps and had a nice romantic dinner.

We started with their bread, which was about $9. I&apos;d say it&apos;s on the better end of the spectrum but certainly not worth the money. I mean, it&apos;s bread! 

Next we had the apple salad which was outstanding. I&apos;m not a huge apple fan but their salad blended sweet with spicy and was just the best. Then we ordered scallops and pork belly and were mesmerized by both. We decided to share everything and didn&apos;t regret it as we enjoyed every single dish they brought out. 

I would highly recommend this place to those seeking a &quot;close to normal&quot; dining experience!"
5,"If Covid&apos;s got you down and you want an excellent date night out with perfect food &amp; beverage, this is THE spot. Safe &amp; socially distant, and the menu is outstanding. They execute to perfection.

Since I&apos;m thorough, below is what we had:

Two kinds of west coast oysters I&apos;ve never had from Samich Bay, Washington: Samich Pearl (left) and Penn Cove (right). These are both third best in my mind next to Kumamotos and Kusshis. Loved em! 

Steak tartare with some seriously amazing *perfect* seeded rye bread, fresno chili dijonaise and fried shallot.

Midwestern cheese plate with fresh chevre, brie, and an ash rind gooey cheese, fennel roasted candied cashews, apricot preserves, and sweet cherries.

Not pictured, a lovely glass of Spanish cava paired with the oysters and a glass of French bordeaux just because. Plus, my hubby&apos;s Westmalle Dubbel beer which was on draft. The place has an extensive Belgian beer list, a well curated wine list, and pretty cocktails. 

I think the intention there is to go there and stuff yourself full of fresh baked bread, meat, and Belgian beer, but really I felt myself being drawn toward the vegetarian dishes. They looked stellar. Next time!

Keep up the good work Publican, your servers are doing a phenomenal job!"
5,"*pre covid review* 

Hands down one of the best brunch places in the city. Their food is just great. If you are open to trying something new but that still feels like comfort food and is delicious then this is the spot. We usually come here for brunch and it is never repetitive. Their menu has a few staples (like their mouth watering, thick, and tender bacon) that don&apos;t change much and then their main dishes which rotate and change. I love that because it means that you are forced to try something different every time. It seems risky on their end but it allows them to remain creative with new dishes and I appreciate that. 
Aside from the amazing food, the staff is great and always attentive. They take reservations which is another reason why I love them but they do book up fairly quickly for brunch some times. 

Overall I love Publican and I highly recommend coming here for brunch or dinner!"
3,"Maybe it was because I came here for brunch but I had very high expectations for this place. Due to Covid, we reserved the prepaid seating in the outdoor igloos and had trouble ordering enough to fulfill the $50 each minimum. Each main dish was ~$15. We ordered the chicken and dumpling, publican scramble (spinach, crema, and crispy shallots), and the pork belly hash. All the food were a little too salty and fatty for my taste but the portions were decent. 

While the food was not very impressive, the drinks were delicious! The bourbon cream coffee and the pear hot toddy hit the spot especially on a cold morning dining outdoors. 

The service was a little a confusion. The waitstaff seemed to be in a rush, perhaps due to the pre-paid outdoor dining time limit and constantly checked to see if we were done with our food. 

However, I have heard good things about its dinner options and willing to try again!"
3,"First time here and first time doing the prepaid seating and our experience has been terrible so far. I understand there&apos;s a pandemic but that shouldn&apos;t be an excuse for a &quot;high end&quot; restaurant. They couldn&apos;t find our prepaid $45 reservations and they don&apos;t have 70% of the menu. We weren&apos;t told this until after we already sat down. I had 4 choices to pick from prior to my arrival and they don&apos;t have every single one of them. We had to rush to order and was completely off guard by the lack of choices. I heard raving reviews of this place and always wanted to give it a try. I support my local restaurants and businesses and this is not a good representation. I only have it 2 stars since they were somewhat accommodating to not being able to find our prepaid reservation and the mask policy is strictly enforced. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star.

Update: the server and manager were apologetic about our experience. Therefore, I upped it another star."
4,"Went for Sunday brunch on 11/22 in the igloos. Great staff, I mean stellar, excellent people. They provided recommendations, knew the menu (super important), and were honest - just down right awesome service. I was not a fan of the hash browns though. The menu literally says &quot;hash browns&quot; but they are deep fried in butter and they were very crispy like hard(maybe some people like that).  

The domes are not heated I would suggest dressing warm, and there is metered parking in walking distance. I loved the new branada toast (it&apos;s not avocado toast although it looks like it on Instagram). The chicken and dumplings were good, skillet looked good really can&apos;t go wrong."
5,"Had a fantastic experience at publican. Beer and wine list is so well rounded, truly something for everyone. We had the scallops, bread and fish dip, oysters, bbq carrots and charc plate. Everything was FANTASTIC! My fiancé a little bummed because ham plate was taken off of menu."
4,"Outdoor seating with translucent pods is a thing and it looks cool. This block of Fulton St is lined with them and you need to have your selfie taken here. 

The publican does comfort food right. By it self the dishes were fine taken as a whole, they take it up a notch. 

The farm chicken with au jus on a bed of French fries is having not only a savory and well seasoned bird but is like having poutine at the same time. The side sausage is good counter to the richness of the bird. By the way the dark meat is absolutely delicious.

The BBQ carrot tasted like meat carrot. It did not taste like a vegetable. Our server suggested the mussels which my wife and son really liked. The bread it came with was excellent. 

Fulton is now bougie - that comes with prices to match just be aware of that when you dine here."
4,"The Publican is a must visit in Chicago for brunch! And during COVID and indoor dining shutdown, they offer outdoor tent dining or individual bubble/ house dining (requires $150 deposit which is non-refundable and is applied towards your restaurant bill.) -- We did the tent and we&apos;re plenty warm. You can make reservations online, but we were able to get a table on Sunday in 45° weather without a reservation. The service was good and the food was delicious! I ordered a bourbon cream coffee which was a bit too bourbony for me, but I think bourbon lovers would go nuts for this! -- Will definitely be back to try more dishes!"
3,"We ate in one of the igloos- &quot;private domes&quot;- they are not heated. The reservation system says &quot;dine without the elements.&quot; You are in the elements when it is cold out, the description is quite misleading. The igloos also have an open flap which also lets a lot of heat escape. 
This should also be made clear when making a reservation and paying a non refundable $200 deposit. Overall food was great, naturally got cold fast but the courses were well spaced. The service was a bit slow especially for how few tables there were."
1,"Terrible service.No hospitality.
We booked the weekend brunch and when we arrived we had to wait a lot until seated then waited again for the order...and again when checking out.our server was cold and showed no hospitality.
There was a lot of trashes around our outdoor seating.
Very, very unpleasant.
Our server told us that  waffle and schnitzel were unavailable, at the timing of ordering , but he should have informed us before...
And food was also average, blunt, no surprise.
Just very much pricey for their portion.
And they charged us full price though we already put $30 in advance , when we booked online...so we had to ask the server to correct it.
Never come back."

Dishes are family style, so I recommend ordering two dishes per person. I honestly enjoyed every dish that I ordered. The potted rillettes were my favourite. There was a great balance of savouriness and sweetness. The sourdough bread was smokey and had the right crispiness, adding texture to the dish.
The honeycrisp apple tartine was refreshing. It had a nice level of acidity that cut through the richness of another dish, the pork shank, that I had. The pork shank was tender. The sauce/jus was delicious with thin slices of mango in it.

I highly recommend The Publican. I would gladly come back to try some other dishes on the menu. I also look forward to going to another restaurant by Paul Kahan."
4,"Great food but VERY pricey for the portion sizes you get. The plates are meant to be shared between a few people but in my opinion, it was more like a plate for one (maybe I just eat too much). My boyfriend took me here for dinner and we enjoyed everything. The restaurant is very family style in terms of seating, which makes the place feel homey and welcoming. There are giant pig paintings on the walls. 

Our service was wonderful. Our waters got refilled very quickly, our plates and utensils got switched out after every plate, we got checked up on often, and when one of us went to the bathroom, our napkin would get refolded and placed nicely by the staff. 

We started out with the chef selection of oysters (6/$18). They came out with a little sheet that explained where they were from and their taste. My favorite are earthy west coast oysters. 

For shareable plates, we ordered the hamachi crudo, pork belly, and sirloin. The pork belly was so tender that you aren&apos;t even given a knife to cut it. It was amazing and melt in your mouth. If you don&apos;t like fatty pork belly, you will probably not like this. The hamachi crudo was very fresh, the calamansi vinegar gave it a nice kick. The dry aged sirloin was also quite good with the cashew butter. 

We finished off with some mead and goat/sheep cheese platter. I&apos;ll be coming back to try the brunch next time."
5,"My wife and I got a well earned getaway weekend for our 10th anniversary! We decided to check out a new place we&apos;d never been to before. I had heard from several others that this place was outstanding so we decided to make a reservation for 6pm on their patio.

They offered patio or indoor seating and with the current COVID-19 Protocols we felt better about being outside. We felt very comfortable as we sat under their heat lamps and had a nice romantic dinner.

We started with their bread, which was about $9. I&apos;d say it&apos;s on the better end of the spectrum but certainly not worth the money. I mean, it&apos;s bread! 

Next we had the apple salad which was outstanding. I&apos;m not a huge apple fan but their salad blended sweet with spicy and was just the best. Then we ordered scallops and pork belly and were mesmerized by both. We decided to share everything and didn&apos;t regret it as we enjoyed every single dish they brought out. 

I would highly recommend this place to those seeking a &quot;close to normal&quot; dining experience!"
5,"If Covid&apos;s got you down and you want an excellent date night out with perfect food &amp; beverage, this is THE spot. Safe &amp; socially distant, and the menu is outstanding. They execute to perfection.

Since I&apos;m thorough, below is what we had:

Two kinds of west coast oysters I&apos;ve never had from Samich Bay, Washington: Samich Pearl (left) and Penn Cove (right). These are both third best in my mind next to Kumamotos and Kusshis. Loved em! 

Steak tartare with some seriously amazing *perfect* seeded rye bread, fresno chili dijonaise and fried shallot.

Midwestern cheese plate with fresh chevre, brie, and an ash rind gooey cheese, fennel roasted candied cashews, apricot preserves, and sweet cherries.

Not pictured, a lovely glass of Spanish cava paired with the oysters and a glass of French bordeaux just because. Plus, my hubby&apos;s Westmalle Dubbel beer which was on draft. The place has an extensive Belgian beer list, a well curated wine list, and pretty cocktails. 

I think the intention there is to go there and stuff yourself full of fresh baked bread, meat, and Belgian beer, but really I felt myself being drawn toward the vegetarian dishes. They looked stellar. Next time!

Keep up the good work Publican, your servers are doing a phenomenal job!"
5,"*pre covid review* 

Hands down one of the best brunch places in the city. Their food is just great. If you are open to trying something new but that still feels like comfort food and is delicious then this is the spot. We usually come here for brunch and it is never repetitive. Their menu has a few staples (like their mouth watering, thick, and tender bacon) that don&apos;t change much and then their main dishes which rotate and change. I love that because it means that you are forced to try something different every time. It seems risky on their end but it allows them to remain creative with new dishes and I appreciate that. 
Aside from the amazing food, the staff is great and always attentive. They take reservations which is another reason why I love them but they do book up fairly quickly for brunch some times. 

Overall I love Publican and I highly recommend coming here for brunch or dinner!"
3,"Maybe it was because I came here for brunch but I had very high expectations for this place. Due to Covid, we reserved the prepaid seating in the outdoor igloos and had trouble ordering enough to fulfill the $50 each minimum. Each main dish was ~$15. We ordered the chicken and dumpling, publican scramble (spinach, crema, and crispy shallots), and the pork belly hash. All the food were a little too salty and fatty for my taste but the portions were decent. 

While the food was not very impressive, the drinks were delicious! The bourbon cream coffee and the pear hot toddy hit the spot especially on a cold morning dining outdoors. 

The service was a little a confusion. The waitstaff seemed to be in a rush, perhaps due to the pre-paid outdoor dining time limit and constantly checked to see if we were done with our food. 

However, I have heard good things about its dinner options and willing to try again!"
3,"First time here and first time doing the prepaid seating and our experience has been terrible so far. I understand there&apos;s a pandemic but that shouldn&apos;t be an excuse for a &quot;high end&quot; restaurant. They couldn&apos;t find our prepaid $45 reservations and they don&apos;t have 70% of the menu. We weren&apos;t told this until after we already sat down. I had 4 choices to pick from prior to my arrival and they don&apos;t have every single one of them. We had to rush to order and was completely off guard by the lack of choices. I heard raving reviews of this place and always wanted to give it a try. I support my local restaurants and businesses and this is not a good representation. I only have it 2 stars since they were somewhat accommodating to not being able to find our prepaid reservation and the mask policy is strictly enforced. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star.

Update: the server and manager were apologetic about our experience. Therefore, I upped it another star."
4,"Went for Sunday brunch on 11/22 in the igloos. Great staff, I mean stellar, excellent people. They provided recommendations, knew the menu (super important), and were honest - just down right awesome service. I was not a fan of the hash browns though. The menu literally says &quot;hash browns&quot; but they are deep fried in butter and they were very crispy like hard(maybe some people like that).  

The domes are not heated I would suggest dressing warm, and there is metered parking in walking distance. I loved the new branada toast (it&apos;s not avocado toast although it looks like it on Instagram). The chicken and dumplings were good, skillet looked good really can&apos;t go wrong."
5,"Had a fantastic experience at publican. Beer and wine list is so well rounded, truly something for everyone. We had the scallops, bread and fish dip, oysters, bbq carrots and charc plate. Everything was FANTASTIC! My fiancé a little bummed because ham plate was taken off of menu."
4,"Outdoor seating with translucent pods is a thing and it looks cool. This block of Fulton St is lined with them and you need to have your selfie taken here. 

The publican does comfort food right. By it self the dishes were fine taken as a whole, they take it up a notch. 

The farm chicken with au jus on a bed of French fries is having not only a savory and well seasoned bird but is like having poutine at the same time. The side sausage is good counter to the richness of the bird. By the way the dark meat is absolutely delicious.

The BBQ carrot tasted like meat carrot. It did not taste like a vegetable. Our server suggested the mussels which my wife and son really liked. The bread it came with was excellent. 

Fulton is now bougie - that comes with prices to match just be aware of that when you dine here."
4,"The Publican is a must visit in Chicago for brunch! And during COVID and indoor dining shutdown, they offer outdoor tent dining or individual bubble/ house dining (requires $150 deposit which is non-refundable and is applied towards your restaurant bill.) -- We did the tent and we&apos;re plenty warm. You can make reservations online, but we were able to get a table on Sunday in 45° weather without a reservation. The service was good and the food was delicious! I ordered a bourbon cream coffee which was a bit too bourbony for me, but I think bourbon lovers would go nuts for this! -- Will definitely be back to try more dishes!"
3,"We ate in one of the igloos- &quot;private domes&quot;- they are not heated. The reservation system says &quot;dine without the elements.&quot; You are in the elements when it is cold out, the description is quite misleading. The igloos also have an open flap which also lets a lot of heat escape. 
This should also be made clear when making a reservation and paying a non refundable $200 deposit. Overall food was great, naturally got cold fast but the courses were well spaced. The service was a bit slow especially for how few tables there were."
1,"Terrible service.No hospitality.
We booked the weekend brunch and when we arrived we had to wait a lot until seated then waited again for the order...and again when checking out.our server was cold and showed no hospitality.
There was a lot of trashes around our outdoor seating.
Very, very unpleasant.
Our server told us that  waffle and schnitzel were unavailable, at the timing of ordering , but he should have informed us before...
And food was also average, blunt, no surprise.
Just very much pricey for their portion.
And they charged us full price though we already put $30 in advance , when we booked online...so we had to ask the server to correct it.
Never come back."
5,"Let&apos;s shine a spotlight on another restaurant that has been truly amazing during the pandemic. 

First, the food is great, even if you don&apos;t order pork. The roast chicken is delicious, with a nicely salty sauce that goes perfectly on their fries, and the sides are interesting, textured, satisfying, and creative. I&apos;m thinking of the bbq carrots with ranch sauce, the burrata with tons of veggies, etc. And the desserts - an important and tough test in my household - are superlative. 

Second, they deliver! To Hyde Park! I don&apos;t mind doing some curbside pickup when I have to, but with little kids at home and Chicago traffic being what it is, I award a huge premium to any place that will give me 30-60 minutes of my life back by delivering to my door. Down here in the ivory tower we don&apos;t have a ton of amazing delivery options. But Publican is one of them.

Third, the customer service goes above and beyond. We had planned out a great spread for a Friday night dinner. The spread arrived, but missing our roast chicken. Hamlet without the prince and all that. Many restaurants would have just apologized and refunded the chicken. But the Publican recognized that without the chicken, dinner was ruined. They rushed the chicken through the kitchen and packed it into an Uber Connect. It arrived before we were done with the first course, and saved the day. And on top of that, they added a loaf of the best Publican bread for free. And they STILL refunded the chicken. 

When I worry about whether the Chicago restaurant scene will survive the pandemic, I think: as long as places like the Publican survive, we will be ok."
4,"Great local food on the main drag on Fulton&apos;s restaurant row. They offer &quot;greenhouse&quot; private dining pods outside with a min. Purchase deposit, which we found quite nice and intimate and well as safe from COVID. Food is to be shared amongst guests and doesn&apos;t come out as a meal but more like tapas. We tried the homemade bread, mussels, shrimp, and scallops- all with lots of fresh herbs and tons of flavor."
4,"We had a really great time here. Beer was great, oysters were great, the bread and dip trio was great! The pork belly for me was just OK and the service also seemed a tiny bit lacking, but overall super glad we decided to make reservations here."
5,"Gotta call in advance and reserve you spot. Decided to check this place out after watching this show called , F*ck that&apos;s delicious, and oh my it really is !!!! We ordered the soft shell crab, oysters and pork belly and frites. That was enough for 2 people. Ambience was nice on a busy Friday night During the pandemic.. but they were extra careful and did what they need to do to make sure everyone stays safe. Really love the food here and can&apos;t wait to come back."
4,"This place is not cheap, but it is ideal for special occasions. 

We started with oysters and a cheese plate, which set the tone for my excellent scallops."
5,"Loved having brunch here! 
Their Covid precautions were well organized and clean. 

The food was amazing! The pork belly was so crispy, chewy, and flavorful. The Biscuit Sandwich with Flank Steak was also a great meal that hit the spot. The different ingredients and condiments in the sandwich complimented each other so well! My favorite was the Belgian waffle. It was so light and crispy, yet was still chewy and so delicious. The jam and butter that came with it was also the perfect complement to the syrup!

Definitely want to come again next time I&apos;m in town!"
5,"Delicious authentic Southern food from New Orleans in Chicago at the Publican. The cute, cozy, and safe dining experience in their private greenhouses. Make sure to dress warm and enjoy the experience."

Not pictured, a lovely glass of Spanish cava paired with the oysters and a glass of French bordeaux just because. Plus, my hubby&apos;s Westmalle Dubbel beer which was on draft. The place has an extensive Belgian beer list, a well curated wine list, and pretty cocktails. 

I think the intention there is to go there and stuff yourself full of fresh baked bread, meat, and Belgian beer, but really I felt myself being drawn toward the vegetarian dishes. They looked stellar. Next time!

Keep up the good work Publican, your servers are doing a phenomenal job!"
5,"*pre covid review* 

Hands down one of the best brunch places in the city. Their food is just great. If you are open to trying something new but that still feels like comfort food and is delicious then this is the spot. We usually come here for brunch and it is never repetitive. Their menu has a few staples (like their mouth watering, thick, and tender bacon) that don&apos;t change much and then their main dishes which rotate and change. I love that because it means that you are forced to try something different every time. It seems risky on their end but it allows them to remain creative with new dishes and I appreciate that. 
Aside from the amazing food, the staff is great and always attentive. They take reservations which is another reason why I love them but they do book up fairly quickly for brunch some times. 

Overall I love Publican and I highly recommend coming here for brunch or dinner!"
3,"Maybe it was because I came here for brunch but I had very high expectations for this place. Due to Covid, we reserved the prepaid seating in the outdoor igloos and had trouble ordering enough to fulfill the $50 each minimum. Each main dish was ~$15. We ordered the chicken and dumpling, publican scramble (spinach, crema, and crispy shallots), and the pork belly hash. All the food were a little too salty and fatty for my taste but the portions were decent. 

While the food was not very impressive, the drinks were delicious! The bourbon cream coffee and the pear hot toddy hit the spot especially on a cold morning dining outdoors. 

The service was a little a confusion. The waitstaff seemed to be in a rush, perhaps due to the pre-paid outdoor dining time limit and constantly checked to see if we were done with our food. 

However, I have heard good things about its dinner options and willing to try again!"
3,"First time here and first time doing the prepaid seating and our experience has been terrible so far. I understand there&apos;s a pandemic but that shouldn&apos;t be an excuse for a &quot;high end&quot; restaurant. They couldn&apos;t find our prepaid $45 reservations and they don&apos;t have 70% of the menu. We weren&apos;t told this until after we already sat down. I had 4 choices to pick from prior to my arrival and they don&apos;t have every single one of them. We had to rush to order and was completely off guard by the lack of choices. I heard raving reviews of this place and always wanted to give it a try. I support my local restaurants and businesses and this is not a good representation. I only have it 2 stars since they were somewhat accommodating to not being able to find our prepaid reservation and the mask policy is strictly enforced. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star.

Update: the server and manager were apologetic about our experience. Therefore, I upped it another star."
4,"Went for Sunday brunch on 11/22 in the igloos. Great staff, I mean stellar, excellent people. They provided recommendations, knew the menu (super important), and were honest - just down right awesome service. I was not a fan of the hash browns though. The menu literally says &quot;hash browns&quot; but they are deep fried in butter and they were very crispy like hard(maybe some people like that).  

The domes are not heated I would suggest dressing warm, and there is metered parking in walking distance. I loved the new branada toast (it&apos;s not avocado toast although it looks like it on Instagram). The chicken and dumplings were good, skillet looked good really can&apos;t go wrong."
5,"Had a fantastic experience at publican. Beer and wine list is so well rounded, truly something for everyone. We had the scallops, bread and fish dip, oysters, bbq carrots and charc plate. Everything was FANTASTIC! My fiancé a little bummed because ham plate was taken off of menu."
4,"Outdoor seating with translucent pods is a thing and it looks cool. This block of Fulton St is lined with them and you need to have your selfie taken here. 

The publican does comfort food right. By it self the dishes were fine taken as a whole, they take it up a notch. 

The farm chicken with au jus on a bed of French fries is having not only a savory and well seasoned bird but is like having poutine at the same time. The side sausage is good counter to the richness of the bird. By the way the dark meat is absolutely delicious.

The BBQ carrot tasted like meat carrot. It did not taste like a vegetable. Our server suggested the mussels which my wife and son really liked. The bread it came with was excellent. 

Fulton is now bougie - that comes with prices to match just be aware of that when you dine here."
4,"The Publican is a must visit in Chicago for brunch! And during COVID and indoor dining shutdown, they offer outdoor tent dining or individual bubble/ house dining (requires $150 deposit which is non-refundable and is applied towards your restaurant bill.) -- We did the tent and we&apos;re plenty warm. You can make reservations online, but we were able to get a table on Sunday in 45° weather without a reservation. The service was good and the food was delicious! I ordered a bourbon cream coffee which was a bit too bourbony for me, but I think bourbon lovers would go nuts for this! -- Will definitely be back to try more dishes!"
3,"We ate in one of the igloos- &quot;private domes&quot;- they are not heated. The reservation system says &quot;dine without the elements.&quot; You are in the elements when it is cold out, the description is quite misleading. The igloos also have an open flap which also lets a lot of heat escape. 
This should also be made clear when making a reservation and paying a non refundable $200 deposit. Overall food was great, naturally got cold fast but the courses were well spaced. The service was a bit slow especially for how few tables there were."
1,"Terrible service.No hospitality.
We booked the weekend brunch and when we arrived we had to wait a lot until seated then waited again for the order...and again when checking out.our server was cold and showed no hospitality.
There was a lot of trashes around our outdoor seating.
Very, very unpleasant.
Our server told us that  waffle and schnitzel were unavailable, at the timing of ordering , but he should have informed us before...
And food was also average, blunt, no surprise.
Just very much pricey for their portion.
And they charged us full price though we already put $30 in advance , when we booked online...so we had to ask the server to correct it.
Never come back."
5,"Let&apos;s shine a spotlight on another restaurant that has been truly amazing during the pandemic. 

First, the food is great, even if you don&apos;t order pork. The roast chicken is delicious, with a nicely salty sauce that goes perfectly on their fries, and the sides are interesting, textured, satisfying, and creative. I&apos;m thinking of the bbq carrots with ranch sauce, the burrata with tons of veggies, etc. And the desserts - an important and tough test in my household - are superlative. 

Second, they deliver! To Hyde Park! I don&apos;t mind doing some curbside pickup when I have to, but with little kids at home and Chicago traffic being what it is, I award a huge premium to any place that will give me 30-60 minutes of my life back by delivering to my door. Down here in the ivory tower we don&apos;t have a ton of amazing delivery options. But Publican is one of them.

Third, the customer service goes above and beyond. We had planned out a great spread for a Friday night dinner. The spread arrived, but missing our roast chicken. Hamlet without the prince and all that. Many restaurants would have just apologized and refunded the chicken. But the Publican recognized that without the chicken, dinner was ruined. They rushed the chicken through the kitchen and packed it into an Uber Connect. It arrived before we were done with the first course, and saved the day. And on top of that, they added a loaf of the best Publican bread for free. And they STILL refunded the chicken. 

When I worry about whether the Chicago restaurant scene will survive the pandemic, I think: as long as places like the Publican survive, we will be ok."
4,"Great local food on the main drag on Fulton&apos;s restaurant row. They offer &quot;greenhouse&quot; private dining pods outside with a min. Purchase deposit, which we found quite nice and intimate and well as safe from COVID. Food is to be shared amongst guests and doesn&apos;t come out as a meal but more like tapas. We tried the homemade bread, mussels, shrimp, and scallops- all with lots of fresh herbs and tons of flavor."
4,"We had a really great time here. Beer was great, oysters were great, the bread and dip trio was great! The pork belly for me was just OK and the service also seemed a tiny bit lacking, but overall super glad we decided to make reservations here."
5,"Gotta call in advance and reserve you spot. Decided to check this place out after watching this show called , F*ck that&apos;s delicious, and oh my it really is !!!! We ordered the soft shell crab, oysters and pork belly and frites. That was enough for 2 people. Ambience was nice on a busy Friday night During the pandemic.. but they were extra careful and did what they need to do to make sure everyone stays safe. Really love the food here and can&apos;t wait to come back."
4,"This place is not cheap, but it is ideal for special occasions. 

We started with oysters and a cheese plate, which set the tone for my excellent scallops."
5,"Loved having brunch here! 
Their Covid precautions were well organized and clean. 

The food was amazing! The pork belly was so crispy, chewy, and flavorful. The Biscuit Sandwich with Flank Steak was also a great meal that hit the spot. The different ingredients and condiments in the sandwich complimented each other so well! My favorite was the Belgian waffle. It was so light and crispy, yet was still chewy and so delicious. The jam and butter that came with it was also the perfect complement to the syrup!

Definitely want to come again next time I&apos;m in town!"
5,"Delicious authentic Southern food from New Orleans in Chicago at the Publican. The cute, cozy, and safe dining experience in their private greenhouses. Make sure to dress warm and enjoy the experience."
5,"The ambience at The Publican is great for groups. I highly recommend making a reservation. They have communal seating so go in with the expectation that you might be seated at a table with strangers, but take advantage of it and have fun! I personally recommend the communal seating for large groups; for dates, request a booth for some more privacy and intimacy.

Dishes are family style, so I recommend ordering two dishes per person. I honestly enjoyed every dish that I ordered. The potted rillettes were my favourite. There was a great balance of savouriness and sweetness. The sourdough bread was smokey and had the right crispiness, adding texture to the dish.
The honeycrisp apple tartine was refreshing. It had a nice level of acidity that cut through the richness of another dish, the pork shank, that I had. The pork shank was tender. The sauce/jus was delicious with thin slices of mango in it.

I highly recommend The Publican. I would gladly come back to try some other dishes on the menu. I also look forward to going to another restaurant by Paul Kahan."
4,"Great food but VERY pricey for the portion sizes you get. The plates are meant to be shared between a few people but in my opinion, it was more like a plate for one (maybe I just eat too much). My boyfriend took me here for dinner and we enjoyed everything. The restaurant is very family style in terms of seating, which makes the place feel homey and welcoming. There are giant pig paintings on the walls. 

Our service was wonderful. Our waters got refilled very quickly, our plates and utensils got switched out after every plate, we got checked up on often, and when one of us went to the bathroom, our napkin would get refolded and placed nicely by the staff. 

We started out with the chef selection of oysters (6/$18). They came out with a little sheet that explained where they were from and their taste. My favorite are earthy west coast oysters. 

For shareable plates, we ordered the hamachi crudo, pork belly, and sirloin. The pork belly was so tender that you aren&apos;t even given a knife to cut it. It was amazing and melt in your mouth. If you don&apos;t like fatty pork belly, you will probably not like this. The hamachi crudo was very fresh, the calamansi vinegar gave it a nice kick. The dry aged sirloin was also quite good with the cashew butter. 

We finished off with some mead and goat/sheep cheese platter. I&apos;ll be coming back to try the brunch next time."
5,"My wife and I got a well earned getaway weekend for our 10th anniversary! We decided to check out a new place we&apos;d never been to before. I had heard from several others that this place was outstanding so we decided to make a reservation for 6pm on their patio.

They offered patio or indoor seating and with the current COVID-19 Protocols we felt better about being outside. We felt very comfortable as we sat under their heat lamps and had a nice romantic dinner.

We started with their bread, which was about $9. I&apos;d say it&apos;s on the better end of the spectrum but certainly not worth the money. I mean, it&apos;s bread! 

Next we had the apple salad which was outstanding. I&apos;m not a huge apple fan but their salad blended sweet with spicy and was just the best. Then we ordered scallops and pork belly and were mesmerized by both. We decided to share everything and didn&apos;t regret it as we enjoyed every single dish they brought out. 

I would highly recommend this place to those seeking a &quot;close to normal&quot; dining experience!"
5,"If Covid&apos;s got you down and you want an excellent date night out with perfect food &amp; beverage, this is THE spot. Safe &amp; socially distant, and the menu is outstanding. They execute to perfection.

Since I&apos;m thorough, below is what we had:

Two kinds of west coast oysters I&apos;ve never had from Samich Bay, Washington: Samich Pearl (left) and Penn Cove (right). These are both third best in my mind next to Kumamotos and Kusshis. Loved em! 

Steak tartare with some seriously amazing *perfect* seeded rye bread, fresno chili dijonaise and fried shallot.

Midwestern cheese plate with fresh chevre, brie, and an ash rind gooey cheese, fennel roasted candied cashews, apricot preserves, and sweet cherries.

The domes are not heated I would suggest dressing warm, and there is metered parking in walking distance. I loved the new branada toast (it&apos;s not avocado toast although it looks like it on Instagram). The chicken and dumplings were good, skillet looked good really can&apos;t go wrong."
5,"Had a fantastic experience at publican. Beer and wine list is so well rounded, truly something for everyone. We had the scallops, bread and fish dip, oysters, bbq carrots and charc plate. Everything was FANTASTIC! My fiancé a little bummed because ham plate was taken off of menu."
4,"Outdoor seating with translucent pods is a thing and it looks cool. This block of Fulton St is lined with them and you need to have your selfie taken here. 

The publican does comfort food right. By it self the dishes were fine taken as a whole, they take it up a notch. 

The farm chicken with au jus on a bed of French fries is having not only a savory and well seasoned bird but is like having poutine at the same time. The side sausage is good counter to the richness of the bird. By the way the dark meat is absolutely delicious.

The BBQ carrot tasted like meat carrot. It did not taste like a vegetable. Our server suggested the mussels which my wife and son really liked. The bread it came with was excellent. 

Fulton is now bougie - that comes with prices to match just be aware of that when you dine here."
4,"The Publican is a must visit in Chicago for brunch! And during COVID and indoor dining shutdown, they offer outdoor tent dining or individual bubble/ house dining (requires $150 deposit which is non-refundable and is applied towards your restaurant bill.) -- We did the tent and we&apos;re plenty warm. You can make reservations online, but we were able to get a table on Sunday in 45° weather without a reservation. The service was good and the food was delicious! I ordered a bourbon cream coffee which was a bit too bourbony for me, but I think bourbon lovers would go nuts for this! -- Will definitely be back to try more dishes!"
3,"We ate in one of the igloos- &quot;private domes&quot;- they are not heated. The reservation system says &quot;dine without the elements.&quot; You are in the elements when it is cold out, the description is quite misleading. The igloos also have an open flap which also lets a lot of heat escape. 
This should also be made clear when making a reservation and paying a non refundable $200 deposit. Overall food was great, naturally got cold fast but the courses were well spaced. The service was a bit slow especially for how few tables there were."
1,"Terrible service.No hospitality.
We booked the weekend brunch and when we arrived we had to wait a lot until seated then waited again for the order...and again when checking out.our server was cold and showed no hospitality.
There was a lot of trashes around our outdoor seating.
Very, very unpleasant.
Our server told us that  waffle and schnitzel were unavailable, at the timing of ordering , but he should have informed us before...
And food was also average, blunt, no surprise.
Just very much pricey for their portion.
And they charged us full price though we already put $30 in advance , when we booked online...so we had to ask the server to correct it.
Never come back."
5,"Let&apos;s shine a spotlight on another restaurant that has been truly amazing during the pandemic. 

First, the food is great, even if you don&apos;t order pork. The roast chicken is delicious, with a nicely salty sauce that goes perfectly on their fries, and the sides are interesting, textured, satisfying, and creative. I&apos;m thinking of the bbq carrots with ranch sauce, the burrata with tons of veggies, etc. And the desserts - an important and tough test in my household - are superlative. 

Second, they deliver! To Hyde Park! I don&apos;t mind doing some curbside pickup when I have to, but with little kids at home and Chicago traffic being what it is, I award a huge premium to any place that will give me 30-60 minutes of my life back by delivering to my door. Down here in the ivory tower we don&apos;t have a ton of amazing delivery options. But Publican is one of them.

Third, the customer service goes above and beyond. We had planned out a great spread for a Friday night dinner. The spread arrived, but missing our roast chicken. Hamlet without the prince and all that. Many restaurants would have just apologized and refunded the chicken. But the Publican recognized that without the chicken, dinner was ruined. They rushed the chicken through the kitchen and packed it into an Uber Connect. It arrived before we were done with the first course, and saved the day. And on top of that, they added a loaf of the best Publican bread for free. And they STILL refunded the chicken. 

When I worry about whether the Chicago restaurant scene will survive the pandemic, I think: as long as places like the Publican survive, we will be ok."
4,"Great local food on the main drag on Fulton&apos;s restaurant row. They offer &quot;greenhouse&quot; private dining pods outside with a min. Purchase deposit, which we found quite nice and intimate and well as safe from COVID. Food is to be shared amongst guests and doesn&apos;t come out as a meal but more like tapas. We tried the homemade bread, mussels, shrimp, and scallops- all with lots of fresh herbs and tons of flavor."
4,"We had a really great time here. Beer was great, oysters were great, the bread and dip trio was great! The pork belly for me was just OK and the service also seemed a tiny bit lacking, but overall super glad we decided to make reservations here."
5,"Gotta call in advance and reserve you spot. Decided to check this place out after watching this show called , F*ck that&apos;s delicious, and oh my it really is !!!! We ordered the soft shell crab, oysters and pork belly and frites. That was enough for 2 people. Ambience was nice on a busy Friday night During the pandemic.. but they were extra careful and did what they need to do to make sure everyone stays safe. Really love the food here and can&apos;t wait to come back."
4,"This place is not cheap, but it is ideal for special occasions. 

We started with oysters and a cheese plate, which set the tone for my excellent scallops."
5,"Loved having brunch here! 
Their Covid precautions were well organized and clean. 

The food was amazing! The pork belly was so crispy, chewy, and flavorful. The Biscuit Sandwich with Flank Steak was also a great meal that hit the spot. The different ingredients and condiments in the sandwich complimented each other so well! My favorite was the Belgian waffle. It was so light and crispy, yet was still chewy and so delicious. The jam and butter that came with it was also the perfect complement to the syrup!

Definitely want to come again next time I&apos;m in town!"
5,"Delicious authentic Southern food from New Orleans in Chicago at the Publican. The cute, cozy, and safe dining experience in their private greenhouses. Make sure to dress warm and enjoy the experience."
5,"The ambience at The Publican is great for groups. I highly recommend making a reservation. They have communal seating so go in with the expectation that you might be seated at a table with strangers, but take advantage of it and have fun! I personally recommend the communal seating for large groups; for dates, request a booth for some more privacy and intimacy.

Dishes are family style, so I recommend ordering two dishes per person. I honestly enjoyed every dish that I ordered. The potted rillettes were my favourite. There was a great balance of savouriness and sweetness. The sourdough bread was smokey and had the right crispiness, adding texture to the dish.
The honeycrisp apple tartine was refreshing. It had a nice level of acidity that cut through the richness of another dish, the pork shank, that I had. The pork shank was tender. The sauce/jus was delicious with thin slices of mango in it.

I highly recommend The Publican. I would gladly come back to try some other dishes on the menu. I also look forward to going to another restaurant by Paul Kahan."
4,"Great food but VERY pricey for the portion sizes you get. The plates are meant to be shared between a few people but in my opinion, it was more like a plate for one (maybe I just eat too much). My boyfriend took me here for dinner and we enjoyed everything. The restaurant is very family style in terms of seating, which makes the place feel homey and welcoming. There are giant pig paintings on the walls. 

Our service was wonderful. Our waters got refilled very quickly, our plates and utensils got switched out after every plate, we got checked up on often, and when one of us went to the bathroom, our napkin would get refolded and placed nicely by the staff. 

We started out with the chef selection of oysters (6/$18). They came out with a little sheet that explained where they were from and their taste. My favorite are earthy west coast oysters. 

For shareable plates, we ordered the hamachi crudo, pork belly, and sirloin. The pork belly was so tender that you aren&apos;t even given a knife to cut it. It was amazing and melt in your mouth. If you don&apos;t like fatty pork belly, you will probably not like this. The hamachi crudo was very fresh, the calamansi vinegar gave it a nice kick. The dry aged sirloin was also quite good with the cashew butter. 

We finished off with some mead and goat/sheep cheese platter. I&apos;ll be coming back to try the brunch next time."
5,"My wife and I got a well earned getaway weekend for our 10th anniversary! We decided to check out a new place we&apos;d never been to before. I had heard from several others that this place was outstanding so we decided to make a reservation for 6pm on their patio.

They offered patio or indoor seating and with the current COVID-19 Protocols we felt better about being outside. We felt very comfortable as we sat under their heat lamps and had a nice romantic dinner.

We started with their bread, which was about $9. I&apos;d say it&apos;s on the better end of the spectrum but certainly not worth the money. I mean, it&apos;s bread! 

Next we had the apple salad which was outstanding. I&apos;m not a huge apple fan but their salad blended sweet with spicy and was just the best. Then we ordered scallops and pork belly and were mesmerized by both. We decided to share everything and didn&apos;t regret it as we enjoyed every single dish they brought out. 

I would highly recommend this place to those seeking a &quot;close to normal&quot; dining experience!"
5,"If Covid&apos;s got you down and you want an excellent date night out with perfect food &amp; beverage, this is THE spot. Safe &amp; socially distant, and the menu is outstanding. They execute to perfection.

Since I&apos;m thorough, below is what we had:

Two kinds of west coast oysters I&apos;ve never had from Samich Bay, Washington: Samich Pearl (left) and Penn Cove (right). These are both third best in my mind next to Kumamotos and Kusshis. Loved em! 

Steak tartare with some seriously amazing *perfect* seeded rye bread, fresno chili dijonaise and fried shallot.

Midwestern cheese plate with fresh chevre, brie, and an ash rind gooey cheese, fennel roasted candied cashews, apricot preserves, and sweet cherries.

Not pictured, a lovely glass of Spanish cava paired with the oysters and a glass of French bordeaux just because. Plus, my hubby&apos;s Westmalle Dubbel beer which was on draft. The place has an extensive Belgian beer list, a well curated wine list, and pretty cocktails. 

I think the intention there is to go there and stuff yourself full of fresh baked bread, meat, and Belgian beer, but really I felt myself being drawn toward the vegetarian dishes. They looked stellar. Next time!

Keep up the good work Publican, your servers are doing a phenomenal job!"
5,"*pre covid review* 

Hands down one of the best brunch places in the city. Their food is just great. If you are open to trying something new but that still feels like comfort food and is delicious then this is the spot. We usually come here for brunch and it is never repetitive. Their menu has a few staples (like their mouth watering, thick, and tender bacon) that don&apos;t change much and then their main dishes which rotate and change. I love that because it means that you are forced to try something different every time. It seems risky on their end but it allows them to remain creative with new dishes and I appreciate that. 
Aside from the amazing food, the staff is great and always attentive. They take reservations which is another reason why I love them but they do book up fairly quickly for brunch some times. 

Overall I love Publican and I highly recommend coming here for brunch or dinner!"
3,"Maybe it was because I came here for brunch but I had very high expectations for this place. Due to Covid, we reserved the prepaid seating in the outdoor igloos and had trouble ordering enough to fulfill the $50 each minimum. Each main dish was ~$15. We ordered the chicken and dumpling, publican scramble (spinach, crema, and crispy shallots), and the pork belly hash. All the food were a little too salty and fatty for my taste but the portions were decent. 

While the food was not very impressive, the drinks were delicious! The bourbon cream coffee and the pear hot toddy hit the spot especially on a cold morning dining outdoors. 

The service was a little a confusion. The waitstaff seemed to be in a rush, perhaps due to the pre-paid outdoor dining time limit and constantly checked to see if we were done with our food. 

However, I have heard good things about its dinner options and willing to try again!"
3,"First time here and first time doing the prepaid seating and our experience has been terrible so far. I understand there&apos;s a pandemic but that shouldn&apos;t be an excuse for a &quot;high end&quot; restaurant. They couldn&apos;t find our prepaid $45 reservations and they don&apos;t have 70% of the menu. We weren&apos;t told this until after we already sat down. I had 4 choices to pick from prior to my arrival and they don&apos;t have every single one of them. We had to rush to order and was completely off guard by the lack of choices. I heard raving reviews of this place and always wanted to give it a try. I support my local restaurants and businesses and this is not a good representation. I only have it 2 stars since they were somewhat accommodating to not being able to find our prepaid reservation and the mask policy is strictly enforced. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star.

Update: the server and manager were apologetic about our experience. Therefore, I upped it another star."

I don&apos;t mind doing some curbside pickup when I have to, but with little kids at home and Chicago traffic being what it is, I award a huge premium to any place that will give me 30-60 minutes of my life back by delivering to my door. Down here in the ivory tower we don&apos;t have a ton of amazing delivery options. But Publican is one of them.

Third, the customer service goes above and beyond. We had planned out a great spread for a Friday night dinner. The spread arrived, but missing our roast chicken. Hamlet without the prince and all that. Many restaurants would have just apologized and refunded the chicken. But the Publican recognized that without the chicken, dinner was ruined. They rushed the chicken through the kitchen and packed it into an Uber Connect. It arrived before we were done with the first course, and saved the day. And on top of that, they added a loaf of the best Publican bread for free. And they STILL refunded the chicken. 

When I worry about whether the Chicago restaurant scene will survive the pandemic, I think: as long as places like the Publican survive, we will be ok."
4,"Great local food on the main drag on Fulton&apos;s restaurant row. They offer &quot;greenhouse&quot; private dining pods outside with a min. Purchase deposit, which we found quite nice and intimate and well as safe from COVID. Food is to be shared amongst guests and doesn&apos;t come out as a meal but more like tapas. We tried the homemade bread, mussels, shrimp, and scallops- all with lots of fresh herbs and tons of flavor."
4,"We had a really great time here. Beer was great, oysters were great, the bread and dip trio was great! The pork belly for me was just OK and the service also seemed a tiny bit lacking, but overall super glad we decided to make reservations here."
5,"Gotta call in advance and reserve you spot. Decided to check this place out after watching this show called , F*ck that&apos;s delicious, and oh my it really is !!!! We ordered the soft shell crab, oysters and pork belly and frites. That was enough for 2 people. Ambience was nice on a busy Friday night During the pandemic.. but they were extra careful and did what they need to do to make sure everyone stays safe. Really love the food here and can&apos;t wait to come back."
4,"This place is not cheap, but it is ideal for special occasions. 

We started with oysters and a cheese plate, which set the tone for my excellent scallops."
5,"Loved having brunch here! 
Their Covid precautions were well organized and clean. 

The food was amazing! The pork belly was so crispy, chewy, and flavorful. The Biscuit Sandwich with Flank Steak was also a great meal that hit the spot. The different ingredients and condiments in the sandwich complimented each other so well! My favorite was the Belgian waffle. It was so light and crispy, yet was still chewy and so delicious. The jam and butter that came with it was also the perfect complement to the syrup!

Definitely want to come again next time I&apos;m in town!"
5,"Delicious authentic Southern food from New Orleans in Chicago at the Publican. The cute, cozy, and safe dining experience in their private greenhouses. Make sure to dress warm and enjoy the experience."
5,"The ambience at The Publican is great for groups. I highly recommend making a reservation. They have communal seating so go in with the expectation that you might be seated at a table with strangers, but take advantage of it and have fun! I personally recommend the communal seating for large groups; for dates, request a booth for some more privacy and intimacy.

Dishes are family style, so I recommend ordering two dishes per person. I honestly enjoyed every dish that I ordered. The potted rillettes were my favourite. There was a great balance of savouriness and sweetness. The sourdough bread was smokey and had the right crispiness, adding texture to the dish.
The honeycrisp apple tartine was refreshing. It had a nice level of acidity that cut through the richness of another dish, the pork shank, that I had. The pork shank was tender. The sauce/jus was delicious with thin slices of mango in it.

I highly recommend The Publican. I would gladly come back to try some other dishes on the menu. I also look forward to going to another restaurant by Paul Kahan."
4,"Great food but VERY pricey for the portion sizes you get. The plates are meant to be shared between a few people but in my opinion, it was more like a plate for one (maybe I just eat too much). My boyfriend took me here for dinner and we enjoyed everything. The restaurant is very family style in terms of seating, which makes the place feel homey and welcoming. There are giant pig paintings on the walls. 

Our service was wonderful. Our waters got refilled very quickly, our plates and utensils got switched out after every plate, we got checked up on often, and when one of us went to the bathroom, our napkin would get refolded and placed nicely by the staff. 

We started out with the chef selection of oysters (6/$18). They came out with a little sheet that explained where they were from and their taste. My favorite are earthy west coast oysters. 

For shareable plates, we ordered the hamachi crudo, pork belly, and sirloin. The pork belly was so tender that you aren&apos;t even given a knife to cut it. It was amazing and melt in your mouth. If you don&apos;t like fatty pork belly, you will probably not like this. The hamachi crudo was very fresh, the calamansi vinegar gave it a nice kick. The dry aged sirloin was also quite good with the cashew butter. 

We finished off with some mead and goat/sheep cheese platter. I&apos;ll be coming back to try the brunch next time."
5,"My wife and I got a well earned getaway weekend for our 10th anniversary! We decided to check out a new place we&apos;d never been to before. I had heard from several others that this place was outstanding so we decided to make a reservation for 6pm on their patio.

They offered patio or indoor seating and with the current COVID-19 Protocols we felt better about being outside. We felt very comfortable as we sat under their heat lamps and had a nice romantic dinner.

We started with their bread, which was about $9. I&apos;d say it&apos;s on the better end of the spectrum but certainly not worth the money. I mean, it&apos;s bread! 

Next we had the apple salad which was outstanding. I&apos;m not a huge apple fan but their salad blended sweet with spicy and was just the best. Then we ordered scallops and pork belly and were mesmerized by both. We decided to share everything and didn&apos;t regret it as we enjoyed every single dish they brought out. 

I would highly recommend this place to those seeking a &quot;close to normal&quot; dining experience!"
5,"If Covid&apos;s got you down and you want an excellent date night out with perfect food &amp; beverage, this is THE spot. Safe &amp; socially distant, and the menu is outstanding. They execute to perfection.

Since I&apos;m thorough, below is what we had:

Two kinds of west coast oysters I&apos;ve never had from Samich Bay, Washington: Samich Pearl (left) and Penn Cove (right). These are both third best in my mind next to Kumamotos and Kusshis. Loved em! 

Steak tartare with some seriously amazing *perfect* seeded rye bread, fresno chili dijonaise and fried shallot.

Midwestern cheese plate with fresh chevre, brie, and an ash rind gooey cheese, fennel roasted candied cashews, apricot preserves, and sweet cherries.

Not pictured, a lovely glass of Spanish cava paired with the oysters and a glass of French bordeaux just because. Plus, my hubby&apos;s Westmalle Dubbel beer which was on draft. The place has an extensive Belgian beer list, a well curated wine list, and pretty cocktails. 

I think the intention there is to go there and stuff yourself full of fresh baked bread, meat, and Belgian beer, but really I felt myself being drawn toward the vegetarian dishes. They looked stellar. Next time!

Keep up the good work Publican, your servers are doing a phenomenal job!"
5,"*pre covid review* 

Hands down one of the best brunch places in the city. Their food is just great. If you are open to trying something new but that still feels like comfort food and is delicious then this is the spot. We usually come here for brunch and it is never repetitive. Their menu has a few staples (like their mouth watering, thick, and tender bacon) that don&apos;t change much and then their main dishes which rotate and change. I love that because it means that you are forced to try something different every time. It seems risky on their end but it allows them to remain creative with new dishes and I appreciate that. 
Aside from the amazing food, the staff is great and always attentive. They take reservations which is another reason why I love them but they do book up fairly quickly for brunch some times. 

Overall I love Publican and I highly recommend coming here for brunch or dinner!"
3,"Maybe it was because I came here for brunch but I had very high expectations for this place. Due to Covid, we reserved the prepaid seating in the outdoor igloos and had trouble ordering enough to fulfill the $50 each minimum. Each main dish was ~$15. We ordered the chicken and dumpling, publican scramble (spinach, crema, and crispy shallots), and the pork belly hash. All the food were a little too salty and fatty for my taste but the portions were decent. 

While the food was not very impressive, the drinks were delicious! The bourbon cream coffee and the pear hot toddy hit the spot especially on a cold morning dining outdoors. 

The service was a little a confusion. The waitstaff seemed to be in a rush, perhaps due to the pre-paid outdoor dining time limit and constantly checked to see if we were done with our food. 

However, I have heard good things about its dinner options and willing to try again!"
3,"First time here and first time doing the prepaid seating and our experience has been terrible so far. I understand there&apos;s a pandemic but that shouldn&apos;t be an excuse for a &quot;high end&quot; restaurant. They couldn&apos;t find our prepaid $45 reservations and they don&apos;t have 70% of the menu. We weren&apos;t told this until after we already sat down. I had 4 choices to pick from prior to my arrival and they don&apos;t have every single one of them. We had to rush to order and was completely off guard by the lack of choices. I heard raving reviews of this place and always wanted to give it a try. I support my local restaurants and businesses and this is not a good representation. I only have it 2 stars since they were somewhat accommodating to not being able to find our prepaid reservation and the mask policy is strictly enforced. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star.

Update: the server and manager were apologetic about our experience. Therefore, I upped it another star."
4,"Went for Sunday brunch on 11/22 in the igloos. Great staff, I mean stellar, excellent people. They provided recommendations, knew the menu (super important), and were honest - just down right awesome service. I was not a fan of the hash browns though. The menu literally says &quot;hash browns&quot; but they are deep fried in butter and they were very crispy like hard(maybe some people like that).  

The domes are not heated I would suggest dressing warm, and there is metered parking in walking distance. I loved the new branada toast (it&apos;s not avocado toast although it looks like it on Instagram). The chicken and dumplings were good, skillet looked good really can&apos;t go wrong."
5,"Had a fantastic experience at publican. Beer and wine list is so well rounded, truly something for everyone. We had the scallops, bread and fish dip, oysters, bbq carrots and charc plate. Everything was FANTASTIC! My fiancé a little bummed because ham plate was taken off of menu."
4,"Outdoor seating with translucent pods is a thing and it looks cool. This block of Fulton St is lined with them and you need to have your selfie taken here. 

The publican does comfort food right. By it self the dishes were fine taken as a whole, they take it up a notch. 

The farm chicken with au jus on a bed of French fries is having not only a savory and well seasoned bird but is like having poutine at the same time. The side sausage is good counter to the richness of the bird. By the way the dark meat is absolutely delicious.

The BBQ carrot tasted like meat carrot. It did not taste like a vegetable. Our server suggested the mussels which my wife and son really liked. The bread it came with was excellent. 

Fulton is now bougie - that comes with prices to match just be aware of that when you dine here."
4,"The Publican is a must visit in Chicago for brunch! And during COVID and indoor dining shutdown, they offer outdoor tent dining or individual bubble/ house dining (requires $150 deposit which is non-refundable and is applied towards your restaurant bill.) -- We did the tent and we&apos;re plenty warm. You can make reservations online, but we were able to get a table on Sunday in 45° weather without a reservation. The service was good and the food was delicious! I ordered a bourbon cream coffee which was a bit too bourbony for me, but I think bourbon lovers would go nuts for this! -- Will definitely be back to try more dishes!"
3,"We ate in one of the igloos- &quot;private domes&quot;- they are not heated. The reservation system says &quot;dine without the elements.&quot; You are in the elements when it is cold out, the description is quite misleading. The igloos also have an open flap which also lets a lot of heat escape. 
This should also be made clear when making a reservation and paying a non refundable $200 deposit. Overall food was great, naturally got cold fast but the courses were well spaced. The service was a bit slow especially for how few tables there were."
1,"Terrible service.No hospitality.
We booked the weekend brunch and when we arrived we had to wait a lot until seated then waited again for the order...and again when checking out.our server was cold and showed no hospitality.
There was a lot of trashes around our outdoor seating.
Very, very unpleasant.
Our server told us that  waffle and schnitzel were unavailable, at the timing of ordering , but he should have informed us before...
And food was also average, blunt, no surprise.
Just very much pricey for their portion.
And they charged us full price though we already put $30 in advance , when we booked online...so we had to ask the server to correct it.
Never come back."
5,"Let&apos;s shine a spotlight on another restaurant that has been truly amazing during the pandemic. 

First, the food is great, even if you don&apos;t order pork. The roast chicken is delicious, with a nicely salty sauce that goes perfectly on their fries, and the sides are interesting, textured, satisfying, and creative. I&apos;m thinking of the bbq carrots with ranch sauce, the burrata with tons of veggies, etc. And the desserts - an important and tough test in my household - are superlative. 

Second, they deliver! To Hyde Park!

The honeycrisp apple tartine was refreshing. It had a nice level of acidity that cut through the richness of another dish, the pork shank, that I had. The pork shank was tender. The sauce/jus was delicious with thin slices of mango in it.

I highly recommend The Publican. I would gladly come back to try some other dishes on the menu. I also look forward to going to another restaurant by Paul Kahan."
4,"Great food but VERY pricey for the portion sizes you get. The plates are meant to be shared between a few people but in my opinion, it was more like a plate for one (maybe I just eat too much). My boyfriend took me here for dinner and we enjoyed everything. The restaurant is very family style in terms of seating, which makes the place feel homey and welcoming. There are giant pig paintings on the walls. 

Our service was wonderful. Our waters got refilled very quickly, our plates and utensils got switched out after every plate, we got checked up on often, and when one of us went to the bathroom, our napkin would get refolded and placed nicely by the staff. 

We started out with the chef selection of oysters (6/$18). They came out with a little sheet that explained where they were from and their taste. My favorite are earthy west coast oysters. 

For shareable plates, we ordered the hamachi crudo, pork belly, and sirloin. The pork belly was so tender that you aren&apos;t even given a knife to cut it. It was amazing and melt in your mouth. If you don&apos;t like fatty pork belly, you will probably not like this. The hamachi crudo was very fresh, the calamansi vinegar gave it a nice kick. The dry aged sirloin was also quite good with the cashew butter. 

We finished off with some mead and goat/sheep cheese platter. I&apos;ll be coming back to try the brunch next time."
5,"My wife and I got a well earned getaway weekend for our 10th anniversary! We decided to check out a new place we&apos;d never been to before. I had heard from several others that this place was outstanding so we decided to make a reservation for 6pm on their patio.

They offered patio or indoor seating and with the current COVID-19 Protocols we felt better about being outside. We felt very comfortable as we sat under their heat lamps and had a nice romantic dinner.

We started with their bread, which was about $9. I&apos;d say it&apos;s on the better end of the spectrum but certainly not worth the money. I mean, it&apos;s bread! 

Next we had the apple salad which was outstanding. I&apos;m not a huge apple fan but their salad blended sweet with spicy and was just the best. Then we ordered scallops and pork belly and were mesmerized by both. We decided to share everything and didn&apos;t regret it as we enjoyed every single dish they brought out. 

I would highly recommend this place to those seeking a &quot;close to normal&quot; dining experience!"
5,"If Covid&apos;s got you down and you want an excellent date night out with perfect food &amp; beverage, this is THE spot. Safe &amp; socially distant, and the menu is outstanding. They execute to perfection.

Since I&apos;m thorough, below is what we had:

Two kinds of west coast oysters I&apos;ve never had from Samich Bay, Washington: Samich Pearl (left) and Penn Cove (right). These are both third best in my mind next to Kumamotos and Kusshis. Loved em! 

Steak tartare with some seriously amazing *perfect* seeded rye bread, fresno chili dijonaise and fried shallot.

Midwestern cheese plate with fresh chevre, brie, and an ash rind gooey cheese, fennel roasted candied cashews, apricot preserves, and sweet cherries.

Not pictured, a lovely glass of Spanish cava paired with the oysters and a glass of French bordeaux just because. Plus, my hubby&apos;s Westmalle Dubbel beer which was on draft. The place has an extensive Belgian beer list, a well curated wine list, and pretty cocktails. 

I think the intention there is to go there and stuff yourself full of fresh baked bread, meat, and Belgian beer, but really I felt myself being drawn toward the vegetarian dishes. They looked stellar. Next time!

Keep up the good work Publican, your servers are doing a phenomenal job!"
5,"*pre covid review* 

Hands down one of the best brunch places in the city. Their food is just great. If you are open to trying something new but that still feels like comfort food and is delicious then this is the spot. We usually come here for brunch and it is never repetitive. Their menu has a few staples (like their mouth watering, thick, and tender bacon) that don&apos;t change much and then their main dishes which rotate and change. I love that because it means that you are forced to try something different every time. It seems risky on their end but it allows them to remain creative with new dishes and I appreciate that. 
Aside from the amazing food, the staff is great and always attentive. They take reservations which is another reason why I love them but they do book up fairly quickly for brunch some times. 

Overall I love Publican and I highly recommend coming here for brunch or dinner!"
3,"Maybe it was because I came here for brunch but I had very high expectations for this place. Due to Covid, we reserved the prepaid seating in the outdoor igloos and had trouble ordering enough to fulfill the $50 each minimum. Each main dish was ~$15. We ordered the chicken and dumpling, publican scramble (spinach, crema, and crispy shallots), and the pork belly hash. All the food were a little too salty and fatty for my taste but the portions were decent. 

While the food was not very impressive, the drinks were delicious! The bourbon cream coffee and the pear hot toddy hit the spot especially on a cold morning dining outdoors. 

The service was a little a confusion. The waitstaff seemed to be in a rush, perhaps due to the pre-paid outdoor dining time limit and constantly checked to see if we were done with our food. 

However, I have heard good things about its dinner options and willing to try again!"
3,"First time here and first time doing the prepaid seating and our experience has been terrible so far. I understand there&apos;s a pandemic but that shouldn&apos;t be an excuse for a &quot;high end&quot; restaurant. They couldn&apos;t find our prepaid $45 reservations and they don&apos;t have 70% of the menu. We weren&apos;t told this until after we already sat down. I had 4 choices to pick from prior to my arrival and they don&apos;t have every single one of them. We had to rush to order and was completely off guard by the lack of choices. I heard raving reviews of this place and always wanted to give it a try. I support my local restaurants and businesses and this is not a good representation. I only have it 2 stars since they were somewhat accommodating to not being able to find our prepaid reservation and the mask policy is strictly enforced. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star.

Update: the server and manager were apologetic about our experience. Therefore, I upped it another star."
4,"Went for Sunday brunch on 11/22 in the igloos. Great staff, I mean stellar, excellent people. They provided recommendations, knew the menu (super important), and were honest - just down right awesome service. I was not a fan of the hash browns though. The menu literally says &quot;hash browns&quot; but they are deep fried in butter and they were very crispy like hard(maybe some people like that).  

The domes are not heated I would suggest dressing warm, and there is metered parking in walking distance. I loved the new branada toast (it&apos;s not avocado toast although it looks like it on Instagram). The chicken and dumplings were good, skillet looked good really can&apos;t go wrong."
5,"Had a fantastic experience at publican. Beer and wine list is so well rounded, truly something for everyone. We had the scallops, bread and fish dip, oysters, bbq carrots and charc plate. Everything was FANTASTIC! My fiancé a little bummed because ham plate was taken off of menu."
4,"Outdoor seating with translucent pods is a thing and it looks cool. This block of Fulton St is lined with them and you need to have your selfie taken here. 

The publican does comfort food right. By it self the dishes were fine taken as a whole, they take it up a notch. 

The farm chicken with au jus on a bed of French fries is having not only a savory and well seasoned bird but is like having poutine at the same time. The side sausage is good counter to the richness of the bird. By the way the dark meat is absolutely delicious.

The BBQ carrot tasted like meat carrot. It did not taste like a vegetable. Our server suggested the mussels which my wife and son really liked. The bread it came with was excellent. 

Fulton is now bougie - that comes with prices to match just be aware of that when you dine here."
4,"The Publican is a must visit in Chicago for brunch! And during COVID and indoor dining shutdown, they offer outdoor tent dining or individual bubble/ house dining (requires $150 deposit which is non-refundable and is applied towards your restaurant bill.) -- We did the tent and we&apos;re plenty warm. You can make reservations online, but we were able to get a table on Sunday in 45° weather without a reservation. The service was good and the food was delicious! I ordered a bourbon cream coffee which was a bit too bourbony for me, but I think bourbon lovers would go nuts for this! -- Will definitely be back to try more dishes!"
3,"We ate in one of the igloos- &quot;private domes&quot;- they are not heated. The reservation system says &quot;dine without the elements.&quot; You are in the elements when it is cold out, the description is quite misleading. The igloos also have an open flap which also lets a lot of heat escape. 
This should also be made clear when making a reservation and paying a non refundable $200 deposit. Overall food was great, naturally got cold fast but the courses were well spaced. The service was a bit slow especially for how few tables there were."
1,"Terrible service.No hospitality.
We booked the weekend brunch and when we arrived we had to wait a lot until seated then waited again for the order...and again when checking out.our server was cold and showed no hospitality.
There was a lot of trashes around our outdoor seating.
Very, very unpleasant.
Our server told us that  waffle and schnitzel were unavailable, at the timing of ordering , but he should have informed us before...
And food was also average, blunt, no surprise.
Just very much pricey for their portion.
And they charged us full price though we already put $30 in advance , when we booked online...so we had to ask the server to correct it.
Never come back."
5,"Let&apos;s shine a spotlight on another restaurant that has been truly amazing during the pandemic. 

First, the food is great, even if you don&apos;t order pork. The roast chicken is delicious, with a nicely salty sauce that goes perfectly on their fries, and the sides are interesting, textured, satisfying, and creative. I&apos;m thinking of the bbq carrots with ranch sauce, the burrata with tons of veggies, etc. And the desserts - an important and tough test in my household - are superlative. 

Second, they deliver! To Hyde Park! I don&apos;t mind doing some curbside pickup when I have to, but with little kids at home and Chicago traffic being what it is, I award a huge premium to any place that will give me 30-60 minutes of my life back by delivering to my door. Down here in the ivory tower we don&apos;t have a ton of amazing delivery options. But Publican is one of them.

Third, the customer service goes above and beyond. We had planned out a great spread for a Friday night dinner. The spread arrived, but missing our roast chicken. Hamlet without the prince and all that. Many restaurants would have just apologized and refunded the chicken. But the Publican recognized that without the chicken, dinner was ruined. They rushed the chicken through the kitchen and packed it into an Uber Connect. It arrived before we were done with the first course, and saved the day. And on top of that, they added a loaf of the best Publican bread for free. And they STILL refunded the chicken. 

When I worry about whether the Chicago restaurant scene will survive the pandemic, I think: as long as places like the Publican survive, we will be ok."
4,"Great local food on the main drag on Fulton&apos;s restaurant row. They offer &quot;greenhouse&quot; private dining pods outside with a min. Purchase deposit, which we found quite nice and intimate and well as safe from COVID. Food is to be shared amongst guests and doesn&apos;t come out as a meal but more like tapas. We tried the homemade bread, mussels, shrimp, and scallops- all with lots of fresh herbs and tons of flavor."
4,"We had a really great time here. Beer was great, oysters were great, the bread and dip trio was great! The pork belly for me was just OK and the service also seemed a tiny bit lacking, but overall super glad we decided to make reservations here."
5,"Gotta call in advance and reserve you spot. Decided to check this place out after watching this show called , F*ck that&apos;s delicious, and oh my it really is !!!! We ordered the soft shell crab, oysters and pork belly and frites. That was enough for 2 people. Ambience was nice on a busy Friday night During the pandemic.. but they were extra careful and did what they need to do to make sure everyone stays safe. Really love the food here and can&apos;t wait to come back."
4,"This place is not cheap, but it is ideal for special occasions. 

We started with oysters and a cheese plate, which set the tone for my excellent scallops."
5,"Loved having brunch here! 
Their Covid precautions were well organized and clean. 

The food was amazing! The pork belly was so crispy, chewy, and flavorful. The Biscuit Sandwich with Flank Steak was also a great meal that hit the spot. The different ingredients and condiments in the sandwich complimented each other so well! My favorite was the Belgian waffle. It was so light and crispy, yet was still chewy and so delicious. The jam and butter that came with it was also the perfect complement to the syrup!

Definitely want to come again next time I&apos;m in town!"
5,"Delicious authentic Southern food from New Orleans in Chicago at the Publican. The cute, cozy, and safe dining experience in their private greenhouses. Make sure to dress warm and enjoy the experience."
5,"The ambience at The Publican is great for groups. I highly recommend making a reservation. They have communal seating so go in with the expectation that you might be seated at a table with strangers, but take advantage of it and have fun! I personally recommend the communal seating for large groups; for dates, request a booth for some more privacy and intimacy.

Dishes are family style, so I recommend ordering two dishes per person. I honestly enjoyed every dish that I ordered. The potted rillettes were my favourite.

I think the intention there is to go there and stuff yourself full of fresh baked bread, meat, and Belgian beer, but really I felt myself being drawn toward the vegetarian dishes. They looked stellar. Next time!

Keep up the good work Publican, your servers are doing a phenomenal job!"
5,"*pre covid review* 

Hands down one of the best brunch places in the city. Their food is just great. If you are open to trying something new but that still feels like comfort food and is delicious then this is the spot. We usually come here for brunch and it is never repetitive. Their menu has a few staples (like their mouth watering, thick, and tender bacon) that don&apos;t change much and then their main dishes which rotate and change. I love that because it means that you are forced to try something different every time. It seems risky on their end but it allows them to remain creative with new dishes and I appreciate that. 
Aside from the amazing food, the staff is great and always attentive. They take reservations which is another reason why I love them but they do book up fairly quickly for brunch some times. 

Overall I love Publican and I highly recommend coming here for brunch or dinner!"
3,"Maybe it was because I came here for brunch but I had very high expectations for this place. Due to Covid, we reserved the prepaid seating in the outdoor igloos and had trouble ordering enough to fulfill the $50 each minimum. Each main dish was ~$15. We ordered the chicken and dumpling, publican scramble (spinach, crema, and crispy shallots), and the pork belly hash. All the food were a little too salty and fatty for my taste but the portions were decent. 

While the food was not very impressive, the drinks were delicious! The bourbon cream coffee and the pear hot toddy hit the spot especially on a cold morning dining outdoors. 

The service was a little a confusion. The waitstaff seemed to be in a rush, perhaps due to the pre-paid outdoor dining time limit and constantly checked to see if we were done with our food. 

However, I have heard good things about its dinner options and willing to try again!"
3,"First time here and first time doing the prepaid seating and our experience has been terrible so far. I understand there&apos;s a pandemic but that shouldn&apos;t be an excuse for a &quot;high end&quot; restaurant. They couldn&apos;t find our prepaid $45 reservations and they don&apos;t have 70% of the menu. We weren&apos;t told this until after we already sat down. I had 4 choices to pick from prior to my arrival and they don&apos;t have every single one of them. We had to rush to order and was completely off guard by the lack of choices. I heard raving reviews of this place and always wanted to give it a try. I support my local restaurants and businesses and this is not a good representation. I only have it 2 stars since they were somewhat accommodating to not being able to find our prepaid reservation and the mask policy is strictly enforced. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star.

Update: the server and manager were apologetic about our experience. Therefore, I upped it another star."
4,"Went for Sunday brunch on 11/22 in the igloos. Great staff, I mean stellar, excellent people. They provided recommendations, knew the menu (super important), and were honest - just down right awesome service. I was not a fan of the hash browns though. The menu literally says &quot;hash browns&quot; but they are deep fried in butter and they were very crispy like hard(maybe some people like that).  

The domes are not heated I would suggest dressing warm, and there is metered parking in walking distance. I loved the new branada toast (it&apos;s not avocado toast although it looks like it on Instagram). The chicken and dumplings were good, skillet looked good really can&apos;t go wrong."
5,"Had a fantastic experience at publican. Beer and wine list is so well rounded, truly something for everyone. We had the scallops, bread and fish dip, oysters, bbq carrots and charc plate. Everything was FANTASTIC! My fiancé a little bummed because ham plate was taken off of menu."
4,"Outdoor seating with translucent pods is a thing and it looks cool. This block of Fulton St is lined with them and you need to have your selfie taken here. 

The publican does comfort food right. By it self the dishes were fine taken as a whole, they take it up a notch. 

The farm chicken with au jus on a bed of French fries is having not only a savory and well seasoned bird but is like having poutine at the same time. The side sausage is good counter to the richness of the bird. By the way the dark meat is absolutely delicious.

The BBQ carrot tasted like meat carrot. It did not taste like a vegetable. Our server suggested the mussels which my wife and son really liked. The bread it came with was excellent. 

Fulton is now bougie - that comes with prices to match just be aware of that when you dine here."
4,"The Publican is a must visit in Chicago for brunch! And during COVID and indoor dining shutdown, they offer outdoor tent dining or individual bubble/ house dining (requires $150 deposit which is non-refundable and is applied towards your restaurant bill.) -- We did the tent and we&apos;re plenty warm. You can make reservations online, but we were able to get a table on Sunday in 45° weather without a reservation. The service was good and the food was delicious! I ordered a bourbon cream coffee which was a bit too bourbony for me, but I think bourbon lovers would go nuts for this! -- Will definitely be back to try more dishes!"
3,"We ate in one of the igloos- &quot;private domes&quot;- they are not heated. The reservation system says &quot;dine without the elements.&quot; You are in the elements when it is cold out, the description is quite misleading. The igloos also have an open flap which also lets a lot of heat escape. 
This should also be made clear when making a reservation and paying a non refundable $200 deposit. Overall food was great, naturally got cold fast but the courses were well spaced. The service was a bit slow especially for how few tables there were."
1,"Terrible service.No hospitality.
We booked the weekend brunch and when we arrived we had to wait a lot until seated then waited again for the order...and again when checking out.our server was cold and showed no hospitality.
There was a lot of trashes around our outdoor seating.
Very, very unpleasant.
Our server told us that  waffle and schnitzel were unavailable, at the timing of ordering , but he should have informed us before...
And food was also average, blunt, no surprise.
Just very much pricey for their portion.
And they charged us full price though we already put $30 in advance , when we booked online...so we had to ask the server to correct it.
Never come back."
5,"Let&apos;s shine a spotlight on another restaurant that has been truly amazing during the pandemic. 

First, the food is great, even if you don&apos;t order pork. The roast chicken is delicious, with a nicely salty sauce that goes perfectly on their fries, and the sides are interesting, textured, satisfying, and creative. I&apos;m thinking of the bbq carrots with ranch sauce, the burrata with tons of veggies, etc. And the desserts - an important and tough test in my household - are superlative. 

Second, they deliver! To Hyde Park! I don&apos;t mind doing some curbside pickup when I have to, but with little kids at home and Chicago traffic being what it is, I award a huge premium to any place that will give me 30-60 minutes of my life back by delivering to my door. Down here in the ivory tower we don&apos;t have a ton of amazing delivery options. But Publican is one of them.

Third, the customer service goes above and beyond. We had planned out a great spread for a Friday night dinner. The spread arrived, but missing our roast chicken. Hamlet without the prince and all that. Many restaurants would have just apologized and refunded the chicken. But the Publican recognized that without the chicken, dinner was ruined. They rushed the chicken through the kitchen and packed it into an Uber Connect. It arrived before we were done with the first course, and saved the day. And on top of that, they added a loaf of the best Publican bread for free. And they STILL refunded the chicken. 

When I worry about whether the Chicago restaurant scene will survive the pandemic, I think: as long as places like the Publican survive, we will be ok."
4,"Great local food on the main drag on Fulton&apos;s restaurant row. They offer &quot;greenhouse&quot; private dining pods outside with a min. Purchase deposit, which we found quite nice and intimate and well as safe from COVID. Food is to be shared amongst guests and doesn&apos;t come out as a meal but more like tapas. We tried the homemade bread, mussels, shrimp, and scallops- all with lots of fresh herbs and tons of flavor."
4,"We had a really great time here. Beer was great, oysters were great, the bread and dip trio was great! The pork belly for me was just OK and the service also seemed a tiny bit lacking, but overall super glad we decided to make reservations here."
5,"Gotta call in advance and reserve you spot. Decided to check this place out after watching this show called , F*ck that&apos;s delicious, and oh my it really is !!!! We ordered the soft shell crab, oysters and pork belly and frites. That was enough for 2 people. Ambience was nice on a busy Friday night During the pandemic.. but they were extra careful and did what they need to do to make sure everyone stays safe. Really love the food here and can&apos;t wait to come back."
4,"This place is not cheap, but it is ideal for special occasions. 

We started with oysters and a cheese plate, which set the tone for my excellent scallops."
5,"Loved having brunch here! 
Their Covid precautions were well organized and clean. 

The food was amazing! The pork belly was so crispy, chewy, and flavorful. The Biscuit Sandwich with Flank Steak was also a great meal that hit the spot. The different ingredients and condiments in the sandwich complimented each other so well! My favorite was the Belgian waffle. It was so light and crispy, yet was still chewy and so delicious. The jam and butter that came with it was also the perfect complement to the syrup!

Definitely want to come again next time I&apos;m in town!"
5,"Delicious authentic Southern food from New Orleans in Chicago at the Publican. The cute, cozy, and safe dining experience in their private greenhouses. Make sure to dress warm and enjoy the experience."
5,"The ambience at The Publican is great for groups. I highly recommend making a reservation. They have communal seating so go in with the expectation that you might be seated at a table with strangers, but take advantage of it and have fun! I personally recommend the communal seating for large groups; for dates, request a booth for some more privacy and intimacy.

Dishes are family style, so I recommend ordering two dishes per person. I honestly enjoyed every dish that I ordered. The potted rillettes were my favourite. There was a great balance of savouriness and sweetness. The sourdough bread was smokey and had the right crispiness, adding texture to the dish.
The honeycrisp apple tartine was refreshing. It had a nice level of acidity that cut through the richness of another dish, the pork shank, that I had. The pork shank was tender. The sauce/jus was delicious with thin slices of mango in it.

I highly recommend The Publican. I would gladly come back to try some other dishes on the menu. I also look forward to going to another restaurant by Paul Kahan."
4,"Great food but VERY pricey for the portion sizes you get. The plates are meant to be shared between a few people but in my opinion, it was more like a plate for one (maybe I just eat too much). My boyfriend took me here for dinner and we enjoyed everything. The restaurant is very family style in terms of seating, which makes the place feel homey and welcoming. There are giant pig paintings on the walls. 

Our service was wonderful. Our waters got refilled very quickly, our plates and utensils got switched out after every plate, we got checked up on often, and when one of us went to the bathroom, our napkin would get refolded and placed nicely by the staff. 

We started out with the chef selection of oysters (6/$18). They came out with a little sheet that explained where they were from and their taste. My favorite are earthy west coast oysters. 

For shareable plates, we ordered the hamachi crudo, pork belly, and sirloin. The pork belly was so tender that you aren&apos;t even given a knife to cut it. It was amazing and melt in your mouth. If you don&apos;t like fatty pork belly, you will probably not like this. The hamachi crudo was very fresh, the calamansi vinegar gave it a nice kick. The dry aged sirloin was also quite good with the cashew butter. 

We finished off with some mead and goat/sheep cheese platter. I&apos;ll be coming back to try the brunch next time."
5,"My wife and I got a well earned getaway weekend for our 10th anniversary! We decided to check out a new place we&apos;d never been to before. I had heard from several others that this place was outstanding so we decided to make a reservation for 6pm on their patio.

They offered patio or indoor seating and with the current COVID-19 Protocols we felt better about being outside. We felt very comfortable as we sat under their heat lamps and had a nice romantic dinner.

We started with their bread, which was about $9. I&apos;d say it&apos;s on the better end of the spectrum but certainly not worth the money. I mean, it&apos;s bread! 

Next we had the apple salad which was outstanding. I&apos;m not a huge apple fan but their salad blended sweet with spicy and was just the best. Then we ordered scallops and pork belly and were mesmerized by both. We decided to share everything and didn&apos;t regret it as we enjoyed every single dish they brought out. 

I would highly recommend this place to those seeking a &quot;close to normal&quot; dining experience!"
5,"If Covid&apos;s got you down and you want an excellent date night out with perfect food &amp; beverage, this is THE spot. Safe &amp; socially distant, and the menu is outstanding. They execute to perfection.

Since I&apos;m thorough, below is what we had:

Two kinds of west coast oysters I&apos;ve never had from Samich Bay, Washington: Samich Pearl (left) and Penn Cove (right). These are both third best in my mind next to Kumamotos and Kusshis. Loved em! 

Steak tartare with some seriously amazing *perfect* seeded rye bread, fresno chili dijonaise and fried shallot.

Midwestern cheese plate with fresh chevre, brie, and an ash rind gooey cheese, fennel roasted candied cashews, apricot preserves, and sweet cherries.

Not pictured, a lovely glass of Spanish cava paired with the oysters and a glass of French bordeaux just because. Plus, my hubby&apos;s Westmalle Dubbel beer which was on draft. The place has an extensive Belgian beer list, a well curated wine list, and pretty cocktails.

5,"Had a fantastic experience at publican. Beer and wine list is so well rounded, truly something for everyone. We had the scallops, bread and fish dip, oysters, bbq carrots and charc plate. Everything was FANTASTIC! My fiancé a little bummed because ham plate was taken off of menu."
4,"Outdoor seating with translucent pods is a thing and it looks cool. This block of Fulton St is lined with them and you need to have your selfie taken here. 

The publican does comfort food right. By it self the dishes were fine taken as a whole, they take it up a notch. 

The farm chicken with au jus on a bed of French fries is having not only a savory and well seasoned bird but is like having poutine at the same time. The side sausage is good counter to the richness of the bird. By the way the dark meat is absolutely delicious.

The BBQ carrot tasted like meat carrot. It did not taste like a vegetable. Our server suggested the mussels which my wife and son really liked. The bread it came with was excellent. 

Fulton is now bougie - that comes with prices to match just be aware of that when you dine here."
4,"The Publican is a must visit in Chicago for brunch! And during COVID and indoor dining shutdown, they offer outdoor tent dining or individual bubble/ house dining (requires $150 deposit which is non-refundable and is applied towards your restaurant bill.) -- We did the tent and we&apos;re plenty warm. You can make reservations online, but we were able to get a table on Sunday in 45° weather without a reservation. The service was good and the food was delicious! I ordered a bourbon cream coffee which was a bit too bourbony for me, but I think bourbon lovers would go nuts for this! -- Will definitely be back to try more dishes!"
3,"We ate in one of the igloos- &quot;private domes&quot;- they are not heated. The reservation system says &quot;dine without the elements.&quot; You are in the elements when it is cold out, the description is quite misleading. The igloos also have an open flap which also lets a lot of heat escape. 
This should also be made clear when making a reservation and paying a non refundable $200 deposit. Overall food was great, naturally got cold fast but the courses were well spaced. The service was a bit slow especially for how few tables there were."
1,"Terrible service.No hospitality.
We booked the weekend brunch and when we arrived we had to wait a lot until seated then waited again for the order...and again when checking out.our server was cold and showed no hospitality.
There was a lot of trashes around our outdoor seating.
Very, very unpleasant.
Our server told us that  waffle and schnitzel were unavailable, at the timing of ordering , but he should have informed us before...
And food was also average, blunt, no surprise.
Just very much pricey for their portion.
And they charged us full price though we already put $30 in advance , when we booked online...so we had to ask the server to correct it.
Never come back."
5,"Let&apos;s shine a spotlight on another restaurant that has been truly amazing during the pandemic. 

First, the food is great, even if you don&apos;t order pork. The roast chicken is delicious, with a nicely salty sauce that goes perfectly on their fries, and the sides are interesting, textured, satisfying, and creative. I&apos;m thinking of the bbq carrots with ranch sauce, the burrata with tons of veggies, etc. And the desserts - an important and tough test in my household - are superlative. 

Second, they deliver! To Hyde Park! I don&apos;t mind doing some curbside pickup when I have to, but with little kids at home and Chicago traffic being what it is, I award a huge premium to any place that will give me 30-60 minutes of my life back by delivering to my door. Down here in the ivory tower we don&apos;t have a ton of amazing delivery options. But Publican is one of them.

Third, the customer service goes above and beyond. We had planned out a great spread for a Friday night dinner. The spread arrived, but missing our roast chicken. Hamlet without the prince and all that. Many restaurants would have just apologized and refunded the chicken. But the Publican recognized that without the chicken, dinner was ruined. They rushed the chicken through the kitchen and packed it into an Uber Connect. It arrived before we were done with the first course, and saved the day. And on top of that, they added a loaf of the best Publican bread for free. And they STILL refunded the chicken. 

When I worry about whether the Chicago restaurant scene will survive the pandemic, I think: as long as places like the Publican survive, we will be ok."
4,"Great local food on the main drag on Fulton&apos;s restaurant row. They offer &quot;greenhouse&quot; private dining pods outside with a min. Purchase deposit, which we found quite nice and intimate and well as safe from COVID. Food is to be shared amongst guests and doesn&apos;t come out as a meal but more like tapas. We tried the homemade bread, mussels, shrimp, and scallops- all with lots of fresh herbs and tons of flavor."
4,"We had a really great time here. Beer was great, oysters were great, the bread and dip trio was great! The pork belly for me was just OK and the service also seemed a tiny bit lacking, but overall super glad we decided to make reservations here."
5,"Gotta call in advance and reserve you spot. Decided to check this place out after watching this show called , F*ck that&apos;s delicious, and oh my it really is !!!! We ordered the soft shell crab, oysters and pork belly and frites. That was enough for 2 people. Ambience was nice on a busy Friday night During the pandemic.. but they were extra careful and did what they need to do to make sure everyone stays safe. Really love the food here and can&apos;t wait to come back."
4,"This place is not cheap, but it is ideal for special occasions. 

We started with oysters and a cheese plate, which set the tone for my excellent scallops."
5,"Loved having brunch here! 
Their Covid precautions were well organized and clean. 

The food was amazing! The pork belly was so crispy, chewy, and flavorful. The Biscuit Sandwich with Flank Steak was also a great meal that hit the spot. The different ingredients and condiments in the sandwich complimented each other so well! My favorite was the Belgian waffle. It was so light and crispy, yet was still chewy and so delicious. The jam and butter that came with it was also the perfect complement to the syrup!

Definitely want to come again next time I&apos;m in town!"
5,"Delicious authentic Southern food from New Orleans in Chicago at the Publican. The cute, cozy, and safe dining experience in their private greenhouses. Make sure to dress warm and enjoy the experience."
5,"The ambience at The Publican is great for groups. I highly recommend making a reservation. They have communal seating so go in with the expectation that you might be seated at a table with strangers, but take advantage of it and have fun! I personally recommend the communal seating for large groups; for dates, request a booth for some more privacy and intimacy.

Dishes are family style, so I recommend ordering two dishes per person. I honestly enjoyed every dish that I ordered. The potted rillettes were my favourite. There was a great balance of savouriness and sweetness. The sourdough bread was smokey and had the right crispiness, adding texture to the dish.
The honeycrisp apple tartine was refreshing. It had a nice level of acidity that cut through the richness of another dish, the pork shank, that I had. The pork shank was tender. The sauce/jus was delicious with thin slices of mango in it.

I highly recommend The Publican. I would gladly come back to try some other dishes on the menu. I also look forward to going to another restaurant by Paul Kahan."
4,"Great food but VERY pricey for the portion sizes you get. The plates are meant to be shared between a few people but in my opinion, it was more like a plate for one (maybe I just eat too much). My boyfriend took me here for dinner and we enjoyed everything. The restaurant is very family style in terms of seating, which makes the place feel homey and welcoming. There are giant pig paintings on the walls. 

Our service was wonderful. Our waters got refilled very quickly, our plates and utensils got switched out after every plate, we got checked up on often, and when one of us went to the bathroom, our napkin would get refolded and placed nicely by the staff. 

We started out with the chef selection of oysters (6/$18). They came out with a little sheet that explained where they were from and their taste. My favorite are earthy west coast oysters. 

For shareable plates, we ordered the hamachi crudo, pork belly, and sirloin. The pork belly was so tender that you aren&apos;t even given a knife to cut it. It was amazing and melt in your mouth. If you don&apos;t like fatty pork belly, you will probably not like this. The hamachi crudo was very fresh, the calamansi vinegar gave it a nice kick. The dry aged sirloin was also quite good with the cashew butter. 

We finished off with some mead and goat/sheep cheese platter. I&apos;ll be coming back to try the brunch next time."
5,"My wife and I got a well earned getaway weekend for our 10th anniversary! We decided to check out a new place we&apos;d never been to before. I had heard from several others that this place was outstanding so we decided to make a reservation for 6pm on their patio.

They offered patio or indoor seating and with the current COVID-19 Protocols we felt better about being outside. We felt very comfortable as we sat under their heat lamps and had a nice romantic dinner.

We started with their bread, which was about $9. I&apos;d say it&apos;s on the better end of the spectrum but certainly not worth the money. I mean, it&apos;s bread! 

Next we had the apple salad which was outstanding. I&apos;m not a huge apple fan but their salad blended sweet with spicy and was just the best. Then we ordered scallops and pork belly and were mesmerized by both. We decided to share everything and didn&apos;t regret it as we enjoyed every single dish they brought out. 

I would highly recommend this place to those seeking a &quot;close to normal&quot; dining experience!"
5,"If Covid&apos;s got you down and you want an excellent date night out with perfect food &amp; beverage, this is THE spot. Safe &amp; socially distant, and the menu is outstanding. They execute to perfection.

Since I&apos;m thorough, below is what we had:

Two kinds of west coast oysters I&apos;ve never had from Samich Bay, Washington: Samich Pearl (left) and Penn Cove (right). These are both third best in my mind next to Kumamotos and Kusshis. Loved em! 

Steak tartare with some seriously amazing *perfect* seeded rye bread, fresno chili dijonaise and fried shallot.

Midwestern cheese plate with fresh chevre, brie, and an ash rind gooey cheese, fennel roasted candied cashews, apricot preserves, and sweet cherries.

Not pictured, a lovely glass of Spanish cava paired with the oysters and a glass of French bordeaux just because. Plus, my hubby&apos;s Westmalle Dubbel beer which was on draft. The place has an extensive Belgian beer list, a well curated wine list, and pretty cocktails. 

I think the intention there is to go there and stuff yourself full of fresh baked bread, meat, and Belgian beer, but really I felt myself being drawn toward the vegetarian dishes. They looked stellar. Next time!

Keep up the good work Publican, your servers are doing a phenomenal job!"
5,"*pre covid review* 

Hands down one of the best brunch places in the city. Their food is just great. If you are open to trying something new but that still feels like comfort food and is delicious then this is the spot. We usually come here for brunch and it is never repetitive. Their menu has a few staples (like their mouth watering, thick, and tender bacon) that don&apos;t change much and then their main dishes which rotate and change. I love that because it means that you are forced to try something different every time. It seems risky on their end but it allows them to remain creative with new dishes and I appreciate that. 
Aside from the amazing food, the staff is great and always attentive. They take reservations which is another reason why I love them but they do book up fairly quickly for brunch some times. 

Overall I love Publican and I highly recommend coming here for brunch or dinner!"
3,"Maybe it was because I came here for brunch but I had very high expectations for this place. Due to Covid, we reserved the prepaid seating in the outdoor igloos and had trouble ordering enough to fulfill the $50 each minimum. Each main dish was ~$15. We ordered the chicken and dumpling, publican scramble (spinach, crema, and crispy shallots), and the pork belly hash. All the food were a little too salty and fatty for my taste but the portions were decent. 

While the food was not very impressive, the drinks were delicious! The bourbon cream coffee and the pear hot toddy hit the spot especially on a cold morning dining outdoors. 

The service was a little a confusion. The waitstaff seemed to be in a rush, perhaps due to the pre-paid outdoor dining time limit and constantly checked to see if we were done with our food. 

However, I have heard good things about its dinner options and willing to try again!"
3,"First time here and first time doing the prepaid seating and our experience has been terrible so far. I understand there&apos;s a pandemic but that shouldn&apos;t be an excuse for a &quot;high end&quot; restaurant. They couldn&apos;t find our prepaid $45 reservations and they don&apos;t have 70% of the menu. We weren&apos;t told this until after we already sat down. I had 4 choices to pick from prior to my arrival and they don&apos;t have every single one of them. We had to rush to order and was completely off guard by the lack of choices. I heard raving reviews of this place and always wanted to give it a try. I support my local restaurants and businesses and this is not a good representation. I only have it 2 stars since they were somewhat accommodating to not being able to find our prepaid reservation and the mask policy is strictly enforced. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star.

Update: the server and manager were apologetic about our experience. Therefore, I upped it another star."
4,"Went for Sunday brunch on 11/22 in the igloos. Great staff, I mean stellar, excellent people.

I don&apos;t mind doing some curbside pickup when I have to, but with little kids at home and Chicago traffic being what it is, I award a huge premium to any place that will give me 30-60 minutes of my life back by delivering to my door. Down here in the ivory tower we don&apos;t have a ton of amazing delivery options. But Publican is one of them.

Third, the customer service goes above and beyond. We had planned out a great spread for a Friday night dinner. The spread arrived, but missing our roast chicken. Hamlet without the prince and all that. Many restaurants would have just apologized and refunded the chicken. But the Publican recognized that without the chicken, dinner was ruined. They rushed the chicken through the kitchen and packed it into an Uber Connect. It arrived before we were done with the first course, and saved the day. And on top of that, they added a loaf of the best Publican bread for free. And they STILL refunded the chicken. 

When I worry about whether the Chicago restaurant scene will survive the pandemic, I think: as long as places like the Publican survive, we will be ok."
4,"Great local food on the main drag on Fulton&apos;s restaurant row. They offer &quot;greenhouse&quot; private dining pods outside with a min. Purchase deposit, which we found quite nice and intimate and well as safe from COVID. Food is to be shared amongst guests and doesn&apos;t come out as a meal but more like tapas. We tried the homemade bread, mussels, shrimp, and scallops- all with lots of fresh herbs and tons of flavor."
4,"We had a really great time here. Beer was great, oysters were great, the bread and dip trio was great! The pork belly for me was just OK and the service also seemed a tiny bit lacking, but overall super glad we decided to make reservations here."
5,"Gotta call in advance and reserve you spot. Decided to check this place out after watching this show called , F*ck that&apos;s delicious, and oh my it really is !!!! We ordered the soft shell crab, oysters and pork belly and frites. That was enough for 2 people. Ambience was nice on a busy Friday night During the pandemic.. but they were extra careful and did what they need to do to make sure everyone stays safe. Really love the food here and can&apos;t wait to come back."
4,"This place is not cheap, but it is ideal for special occasions. 

We started with oysters and a cheese plate, which set the tone for my excellent scallops."
5,"Loved having brunch here! 
Their Covid precautions were well organized and clean. 

The food was amazing! The pork belly was so crispy, chewy, and flavorful. The Biscuit Sandwich with Flank Steak was also a great meal that hit the spot. The different ingredients and condiments in the sandwich complimented each other so well! My favorite was the Belgian waffle. It was so light and crispy, yet was still chewy and so delicious. The jam and butter that came with it was also the perfect complement to the syrup!

Definitely want to come again next time I&apos;m in town!"
5,"Delicious authentic Southern food from New Orleans in Chicago at the Publican. The cute, cozy, and safe dining experience in their private greenhouses. Make sure to dress warm and enjoy the experience."
5,"The ambience at The Publican is great for groups. I highly recommend making a reservation. They have communal seating so go in with the expectation that you might be seated at a table with strangers, but take advantage of it and have fun! I personally recommend the communal seating for large groups; for dates, request a booth for some more privacy and intimacy.

Dishes are family style, so I recommend ordering two dishes per person. I honestly enjoyed every dish that I ordered. The potted rillettes were my favourite. There was a great balance of savouriness and sweetness. The sourdough bread was smokey and had the right crispiness, adding texture to the dish.
The honeycrisp apple tartine was refreshing. It had a nice level of acidity that cut through the richness of another dish, the pork shank, that I had. The pork shank was tender. The sauce/jus was delicious with thin slices of mango in it.

I highly recommend The Publican. I would gladly come back to try some other dishes on the menu. I also look forward to going to another restaurant by Paul Kahan."
4,"Great food but VERY pricey for the portion sizes you get. The plates are meant to be shared between a few people but in my opinion, it was more like a plate for one (maybe I just eat too much). My boyfriend took me here for dinner and we enjoyed everything. The restaurant is very family style in terms of seating, which makes the place feel homey and welcoming. There are giant pig paintings on the walls. 

Our service was wonderful. Our waters got refilled very quickly, our plates and utensils got switched out after every plate, we got checked up on often, and when one of us went to the bathroom, our napkin would get refolded and placed nicely by the staff. 

We started out with the chef selection of oysters (6/$18). They came out with a little sheet that explained where they were from and their taste. My favorite are earthy west coast oysters. 

For shareable plates, we ordered the hamachi crudo, pork belly, and sirloin. The pork belly was so tender that you aren&apos;t even given a knife to cut it. It was amazing and melt in your mouth. If you don&apos;t like fatty pork belly, you will probably not like this. The hamachi crudo was very fresh, the calamansi vinegar gave it a nice kick. The dry aged sirloin was also quite good with the cashew butter. 

We finished off with some mead and goat/sheep cheese platter. I&apos;ll be coming back to try the brunch next time."
5,"My wife and I got a well earned getaway weekend for our 10th anniversary! We decided to check out a new place we&apos;d never been to before. I had heard from several others that this place was outstanding so we decided to make a reservation for 6pm on their patio.

They offered patio or indoor seating and with the current COVID-19 Protocols we felt better about being outside. We felt very comfortable as we sat under their heat lamps and had a nice romantic dinner.

We started with their bread, which was about $9. I&apos;d say it&apos;s on the better end of the spectrum but certainly not worth the money. I mean, it&apos;s bread! 

Next we had the apple salad which was outstanding. I&apos;m not a huge apple fan but their salad blended sweet with spicy and was just the best. Then we ordered scallops and pork belly and were mesmerized by both. We decided to share everything and didn&apos;t regret it as we enjoyed every single dish they brought out. 

I would highly recommend this place to those seeking a &quot;close to normal&quot; dining experience!"
5,"If Covid&apos;s got you down and you want an excellent date night out with perfect food &amp; beverage, this is THE spot. Safe &amp; socially distant, and the menu is outstanding. They execute to perfection.

Since I&apos;m thorough, below is what we had:

Two kinds of west coast oysters I&apos;ve never had from Samich Bay, Washington: Samich Pearl (left) and Penn Cove (right). These are both third best in my mind next to Kumamotos and Kusshis. Loved em! 

Steak tartare with some seriously amazing *perfect* seeded rye bread, fresno chili dijonaise and fried shallot.

Midwestern cheese plate with fresh chevre, brie, and an ash rind gooey cheese, fennel roasted candied cashews, apricot preserves, and sweet cherries.

Not pictured, a lovely glass of Spanish cava paired with the oysters and a glass of French bordeaux just because. Plus, my hubby&apos;s Westmalle Dubbel beer which was on draft. The place has an extensive Belgian beer list, a well curated wine list, and pretty cocktails. 

I think the intention there is to go there and stuff yourself full of fresh baked bread, meat, and Belgian beer, but really I felt myself being drawn toward the vegetarian dishes. They looked stellar. Next time!

Keep up the good work Publican, your servers are doing a phenomenal job!"
5,"*pre covid review* 

Hands down one of the best brunch places in the city. Their food is just great. If you are open to trying something new but that still feels like comfort food and is delicious then this is the spot. We usually come here for brunch and it is never repetitive. Their menu has a few staples (like their mouth watering, thick, and tender bacon) that don&apos;t change much and then their main dishes which rotate and change. I love that because it means that you are forced to try something different every time. It seems risky on their end but it allows them to remain creative with new dishes and I appreciate that. 
Aside from the amazing food, the staff is great and always attentive. They take reservations which is another reason why I love them but they do book up fairly quickly for brunch some times. 

Overall I love Publican and I highly recommend coming here for brunch or dinner!"
3,"Maybe it was because I came here for brunch but I had very high expectations for this place. Due to Covid, we reserved the prepaid seating in the outdoor igloos and had trouble ordering enough to fulfill the $50 each minimum. Each main dish was ~$15. We ordered the chicken and dumpling, publican scramble (spinach, crema, and crispy shallots), and the pork belly hash. All the food were a little too salty and fatty for my taste but the portions were decent. 

While the food was not very impressive, the drinks were delicious! The bourbon cream coffee and the pear hot toddy hit the spot especially on a cold morning dining outdoors. 

The service was a little a confusion. The waitstaff seemed to be in a rush, perhaps due to the pre-paid outdoor dining time limit and constantly checked to see if we were done with our food. 

However, I have heard good things about its dinner options and willing to try again!"
3,"First time here and first time doing the prepaid seating and our experience has been terrible so far. I understand there&apos;s a pandemic but that shouldn&apos;t be an excuse for a &quot;high end&quot; restaurant. They couldn&apos;t find our prepaid $45 reservations and they don&apos;t have 70% of the menu. We weren&apos;t told this until after we already sat down. I had 4 choices to pick from prior to my arrival and they don&apos;t have every single one of them. We had to rush to order and was completely off guard by the lack of choices. I heard raving reviews of this place and always wanted to give it a try. I support my local restaurants and businesses and this is not a good representation. I only have it 2 stars since they were somewhat accommodating to not being able to find our prepaid reservation and the mask policy is strictly enforced. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star.

Update: the server and manager were apologetic about our experience. Therefore, I upped it another star."
4,"Went for Sunday brunch on 11/22 in the igloos. Great staff, I mean stellar, excellent people. They provided recommendations, knew the menu (super important), and were honest - just down right awesome service. I was not a fan of the hash browns though. The menu literally says &quot;hash browns&quot; but they are deep fried in butter and they were very crispy like hard(maybe some people like that).  

The domes are not heated I would suggest dressing warm, and there is metered parking in walking distance. I loved the new branada toast (it&apos;s not avocado toast although it looks like it on Instagram). The chicken and dumplings were good, skillet looked good really can&apos;t go wrong."
5,"Had a fantastic experience at publican. Beer and wine list is so well rounded, truly something for everyone. We had the scallops, bread and fish dip, oysters, bbq carrots and charc plate. Everything was FANTASTIC! My fiancé a little bummed because ham plate was taken off of menu."
4,"Outdoor seating with translucent pods is a thing and it looks cool. This block of Fulton St is lined with them and you need to have your selfie taken here. 

The publican does comfort food right. By it self the dishes were fine taken as a whole, they take it up a notch. 

The farm chicken with au jus on a bed of French fries is having not only a savory and well seasoned bird but is like having poutine at the same time. The side sausage is good counter to the richness of the bird. By the way the dark meat is absolutely delicious.

The BBQ carrot tasted like meat carrot. It did not taste like a vegetable. Our server suggested the mussels which my wife and son really liked. The bread it came with was excellent. 

Fulton is now bougie - that comes with prices to match just be aware of that when you dine here."
4,"The Publican is a must visit in Chicago for brunch! And during COVID and indoor dining shutdown, they offer outdoor tent dining or individual bubble/ house dining (requires $150 deposit which is non-refundable and is applied towards your restaurant bill.) -- We did the tent and we&apos;re plenty warm. You can make reservations online, but we were able to get a table on Sunday in 45° weather without a reservation. The service was good and the food was delicious! I ordered a bourbon cream coffee which was a bit too bourbony for me, but I think bourbon lovers would go nuts for this! -- Will definitely be back to try more dishes!"
3,"We ate in one of the igloos- &quot;private domes&quot;- they are not heated. The reservation system says &quot;dine without the elements.&quot; You are in the elements when it is cold out, the description is quite misleading. The igloos also have an open flap which also lets a lot of heat escape. 
This should also be made clear when making a reservation and paying a non refundable $200 deposit. Overall food was great, naturally got cold fast but the courses were well spaced. The service was a bit slow especially for how few tables there were."
1,"Terrible service.No hospitality.
We booked the weekend brunch and when we arrived we had to wait a lot until seated then waited again for the order...and again when checking out.our server was cold and showed no hospitality.
There was a lot of trashes around our outdoor seating.
Very, very unpleasant.
Our server told us that  waffle and schnitzel were unavailable, at the timing of ordering , but he should have informed us before...
And food was also average, blunt, no surprise.
Just very much pricey for their portion.
And they charged us full price though we already put $30 in advance , when we booked online...so we had to ask the server to correct it.
Never come back."
5,"Let&apos;s shine a spotlight on another restaurant that has been truly amazing during the pandemic. 

First, the food is great, even if you don&apos;t order pork. The roast chicken is delicious, with a nicely salty sauce that goes perfectly on their fries, and the sides are interesting, textured, satisfying, and creative. I&apos;m thinking of the bbq carrots with ranch sauce, the burrata with tons of veggies, etc. And the desserts - an important and tough test in my household - are superlative. 

Second, they deliver! To Hyde Park!

The honeycrisp apple tartine was refreshing. It had a nice level of acidity that cut through the richness of another dish, the pork shank, that I had. The pork shank was tender. The sauce/jus was delicious with thin slices of mango in it.

I highly recommend The Publican. I would gladly come back to try some other dishes on the menu. I also look forward to going to another restaurant by Paul Kahan."
4,"Great food but VERY pricey for the portion sizes you get. The plates are meant to be shared between a few people but in my opinion, it was more like a plate for one (maybe I just eat too much). My boyfriend took me here for dinner and we enjoyed everything. The restaurant is very family style in terms of seating, which makes the place feel homey and welcoming. There are giant pig paintings on the walls. 

Our service was wonderful. Our waters got refilled very quickly, our plates and utensils got switched out after every plate, we got checked up on often, and when one of us went to the bathroom, our napkin would get refolded and placed nicely by the staff. 

We started out with the chef selection of oysters (6/$18). They came out with a little sheet that explained where they were from and their taste. My favorite are earthy west coast oysters. 

For shareable plates, we ordered the hamachi crudo, pork belly, and sirloin. The pork belly was so tender that you aren&apos;t even given a knife to cut it. It was amazing and melt in your mouth. If you don&apos;t like fatty pork belly, you will probably not like this. The hamachi crudo was very fresh, the calamansi vinegar gave it a nice kick. The dry aged sirloin was also quite good with the cashew butter. 

We finished off with some mead and goat/sheep cheese platter. I&apos;ll be coming back to try the brunch next time."
5,"My wife and I got a well earned getaway weekend for our 10th anniversary! We decided to check out a new place we&apos;d never been to before. I had heard from several others that this place was outstanding so we decided to make a reservation for 6pm on their patio.

They offered patio or indoor seating and with the current COVID-19 Protocols we felt better about being outside. We felt very comfortable as we sat under their heat lamps and had a nice romantic dinner.

We started with their bread, which was about $9. I&apos;d say it&apos;s on the better end of the spectrum but certainly not worth the money. I mean, it&apos;s bread! 

Next we had the apple salad which was outstanding. I&apos;m not a huge apple fan but their salad blended sweet with spicy and was just the best. Then we ordered scallops and pork belly and were mesmerized by both. We decided to share everything and didn&apos;t regret it as we enjoyed every single dish they brought out. 

I would highly recommend this place to those seeking a &quot;close to normal&quot; dining experience!"
5,"If Covid&apos;s got you down and you want an excellent date night out with perfect food &amp; beverage, this is THE spot. Safe &amp; socially distant, and the menu is outstanding. They execute to perfection.

Since I&apos;m thorough, below is what we had:

Two kinds of west coast oysters I&apos;ve never had from Samich Bay, Washington: Samich Pearl (left) and Penn Cove (right). These are both third best in my mind next to Kumamotos and Kusshis. Loved em! 

Steak tartare with some seriously amazing *perfect* seeded rye bread, fresno chili dijonaise and fried shallot.

Midwestern cheese plate with fresh chevre, brie, and an ash rind gooey cheese, fennel roasted candied cashews, apricot preserves, and sweet cherries.

Not pictured, a lovely glass of Spanish cava paired with the oysters and a glass of French bordeaux just because. Plus, my hubby&apos;s Westmalle Dubbel beer which was on draft. The place has an extensive Belgian beer list, a well curated wine list, and pretty cocktails. 

I think the intention there is to go there and stuff yourself full of fresh baked bread, meat, and Belgian beer, but really I felt myself being drawn toward the vegetarian dishes. They looked stellar. Next time!

Keep up the good work Publican, your servers are doing a phenomenal job!"
5,"*pre covid review* 

Hands down one of the best brunch places in the city. Their food is just great. If you are open to trying something new but that still feels like comfort food and is delicious then this is the spot. We usually come here for brunch and it is never repetitive. Their menu has a few staples (like their mouth watering, thick, and tender bacon) that don&apos;t change much and then their main dishes which rotate and change. I love that because it means that you are forced to try something different every time. It seems risky on their end but it allows them to remain creative with new dishes and I appreciate that. 
Aside from the amazing food, the staff is great and always attentive. They take reservations which is another reason why I love them but they do book up fairly quickly for brunch some times. 

Overall I love Publican and I highly recommend coming here for brunch or dinner!"
3,"Maybe it was because I came here for brunch but I had very high expectations for this place. Due to Covid, we reserved the prepaid seating in the outdoor igloos and had trouble ordering enough to fulfill the $50 each minimum. Each main dish was ~$15. We ordered the chicken and dumpling, publican scramble (spinach, crema, and crispy shallots), and the pork belly hash. All the food were a little too salty and fatty for my taste but the portions were decent. 

While the food was not very impressive, the drinks were delicious! The bourbon cream coffee and the pear hot toddy hit the spot especially on a cold morning dining outdoors. 

The service was a little a confusion. The waitstaff seemed to be in a rush, perhaps due to the pre-paid outdoor dining time limit and constantly checked to see if we were done with our food. 

However, I have heard good things about its dinner options and willing to try again!"
3,"First time here and first time doing the prepaid seating and our experience has been terrible so far. I understand there&apos;s a pandemic but that shouldn&apos;t be an excuse for a &quot;high end&quot; restaurant. They couldn&apos;t find our prepaid $45 reservations and they don&apos;t have 70% of the menu. We weren&apos;t told this until after we already sat down. I had 4 choices to pick from prior to my arrival and they don&apos;t have every single one of them. We had to rush to order and was completely off guard by the lack of choices. I heard raving reviews of this place and always wanted to give it a try. I support my local restaurants and businesses and this is not a good representation. I only have it 2 stars since they were somewhat accommodating to not being able to find our prepaid reservation and the mask policy is strictly enforced. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star.

Update: the server and manager were apologetic about our experience. Therefore, I upped it another star."
4,"Went for Sunday brunch on 11/22 in the igloos. Great staff, I mean stellar, excellent people. They provided recommendations, knew the menu (super important), and were honest - just down right awesome service. I was not a fan of the hash browns though. The menu literally says &quot;hash browns&quot; but they are deep fried in butter and they were very crispy like hard(maybe some people like that).  

The domes are not heated I would suggest dressing warm, and there is metered parking in walking distance. I loved the new branada toast (it&apos;s not avocado toast although it looks like it on Instagram). The chicken and dumplings were good, skillet looked good really can&apos;t go wrong."
5,"Had a fantastic experience at publican. Beer and wine list is so well rounded, truly something for everyone. We had the scallops, bread and fish dip, oysters, bbq carrots and charc plate. Everything was FANTASTIC! My fiancé a little bummed because ham plate was taken off of menu."
4,"Outdoor seating with translucent pods is a thing and it looks cool. This block of Fulton St is lined with them and you need to have your selfie taken here. 

The publican does comfort food right. By it self the dishes were fine taken as a whole, they take it up a notch. 

The farm chicken with au jus on a bed of French fries is having not only a savory and well seasoned bird but is like having poutine at the same time. The side sausage is good counter to the richness of the bird. By the way the dark meat is absolutely delicious.

The BBQ carrot tasted like meat carrot. It did not taste like a vegetable. Our server suggested the mussels which my wife and son really liked. The bread it came with was excellent. 

Fulton is now bougie - that comes with prices to match just be aware of that when you dine here."
4,"The Publican is a must visit in Chicago for brunch! And during COVID and indoor dining shutdown, they offer outdoor tent dining or individual bubble/ house dining (requires $150 deposit which is non-refundable and is applied towards your restaurant bill.) -- We did the tent and we&apos;re plenty warm. You can make reservations online, but we were able to get a table on Sunday in 45° weather without a reservation. The service was good and the food was delicious! I ordered a bourbon cream coffee which was a bit too bourbony for me, but I think bourbon lovers would go nuts for this! -- Will definitely be back to try more dishes!"
3,"We ate in one of the igloos- &quot;private domes&quot;- they are not heated. The reservation system says &quot;dine without the elements.&quot; You are in the elements when it is cold out, the description is quite misleading. The igloos also have an open flap which also lets a lot of heat escape. 
This should also be made clear when making a reservation and paying a non refundable $200 deposit. Overall food was great, naturally got cold fast but the courses were well spaced. The service was a bit slow especially for how few tables there were."
1,"Terrible service.No hospitality.
We booked the weekend brunch and when we arrived we had to wait a lot until seated then waited again for the order...and again when checking out.our server was cold and showed no hospitality.
There was a lot of trashes around our outdoor seating.
Very, very unpleasant.
Our server told us that  waffle and schnitzel were unavailable, at the timing of ordering , but he should have informed us before...
And food was also average, blunt, no surprise.
Just very much pricey for their portion.
And they charged us full price though we already put $30 in advance , when we booked online...so we had to ask the server to correct it.
Never come back."
5,"Let&apos;s shine a spotlight on another restaurant that has been truly amazing during the pandemic. 

First, the food is great, even if you don&apos;t order pork. The roast chicken is delicious, with a nicely salty sauce that goes perfectly on their fries, and the sides are interesting, textured, satisfying, and creative. I&apos;m thinking of the bbq carrots with ranch sauce, the burrata with tons of veggies, etc. And the desserts - an important and tough test in my household - are superlative. 

Second, they deliver! To Hyde Park! I don&apos;t mind doing some curbside pickup when I have to, but with little kids at home and Chicago traffic being what it is, I award a huge premium to any place that will give me 30-60 minutes of my life back by delivering to my door. Down here in the ivory tower we don&apos;t have a ton of amazing delivery options. But Publican is one of them.

Third, the customer service goes above and beyond. We had planned out a great spread for a Friday night dinner. The spread arrived, but missing our roast chicken. Hamlet without the prince and all that. Many restaurants would have just apologized and refunded the chicken. But the Publican recognized that without the chicken, dinner was ruined. They rushed the chicken through the kitchen and packed it into an Uber Connect. It arrived before we were done with the first course, and saved the day. And on top of that, they added a loaf of the best Publican bread for free. And they STILL refunded the chicken. 

When I worry about whether the Chicago restaurant scene will survive the pandemic, I think: as long as places like the Publican survive, we will be ok."
4,"Great local food on the main drag on Fulton&apos;s restaurant row. They offer &quot;greenhouse&quot; private dining pods outside with a min. Purchase deposit, which we found quite nice and intimate and well as safe from COVID. Food is to be shared amongst guests and doesn&apos;t come out as a meal but more like tapas. We tried the homemade bread, mussels, shrimp, and scallops- all with lots of fresh herbs and tons of flavor."
4,"We had a really great time here. Beer was great, oysters were great, the bread and dip trio was great! The pork belly for me was just OK and the service also seemed a tiny bit lacking, but overall super glad we decided to make reservations here."
5,"Gotta call in advance and reserve you spot. Decided to check this place out after watching this show called , F*ck that&apos;s delicious, and oh my it really is !!!! We ordered the soft shell crab, oysters and pork belly and frites. That was enough for 2 people. Ambience was nice on a busy Friday night During the pandemic.. but they were extra careful and did what they need to do to make sure everyone stays safe. Really love the food here and can&apos;t wait to come back."
4,"This place is not cheap, but it is ideal for special occasions. 

We started with oysters and a cheese plate, which set the tone for my excellent scallops."
5,"Loved having brunch here! 
Their Covid precautions were well organized and clean. 

The food was amazing! The pork belly was so crispy, chewy, and flavorful. The Biscuit Sandwich with Flank Steak was also a great meal that hit the spot. The different ingredients and condiments in the sandwich complimented each other so well! My favorite was the Belgian waffle. It was so light and crispy, yet was still chewy and so delicious. The jam and butter that came with it was also the perfect complement to the syrup!

Definitely want to come again next time I&apos;m in town!"
5,"Delicious authentic Southern food from New Orleans in Chicago at the Publican. The cute, cozy, and safe dining experience in their private greenhouses. Make sure to dress warm and enjoy the experience."
5,"The ambience at The Publican is great for groups. I highly recommend making a reservation. They have communal seating so go in with the expectation that you might be seated at a table with strangers, but take advantage of it and have fun! I personally recommend the communal seating for large groups; for dates, request a booth for some more privacy and intimacy.

Dishes are family style, so I recommend ordering two dishes per person. I honestly enjoyed every dish that I ordered. The potted rillettes were my favourite.

I think the intention there is to go there and stuff yourself full of fresh baked bread, meat, and Belgian beer, but really I felt myself being drawn toward the vegetarian dishes. They looked stellar. Next time!

Keep up the good work Publican, your servers are doing a phenomenal job!"
5,"*pre covid review* 

Hands down one of the best brunch places in the city. Their food is just great. If you are open to trying something new but that still feels like comfort food and is delicious then this is the spot. We usually come here for brunch and it is never repetitive. Their menu has a few staples (like their mouth watering, thick, and tender bacon) that don&apos;t change much and then their main dishes which rotate and change. I love that because it means that you are forced to try something different every time. It seems risky on their end but it allows them to remain creative with new dishes and I appreciate that. 
Aside from the amazing food, the staff is great and always attentive. They take reservations which is another reason why I love them but they do book up fairly quickly for brunch some times. 

Overall I love Publican and I highly recommend coming here for brunch or dinner!"
3,"Maybe it was because I came here for brunch but I had very high expectations for this place. Due to Covid, we reserved the prepaid seating in the outdoor igloos and had trouble ordering enough to fulfill the $50 each minimum. Each main dish was ~$15. We ordered the chicken and dumpling, publican scramble (spinach, crema, and crispy shallots), and the pork belly hash. All the food were a little too salty and fatty for my taste but the portions were decent. 

While the food was not very impressive, the drinks were delicious! The bourbon cream coffee and the pear hot toddy hit the spot especially on a cold morning dining outdoors. 

The service was a little a confusion. The waitstaff seemed to be in a rush, perhaps due to the pre-paid outdoor dining time limit and constantly checked to see if we were done with our food. 

However, I have heard good things about its dinner options and willing to try again!"
3,"First time here and first time doing the prepaid seating and our experience has been terrible so far. I understand there&apos;s a pandemic but that shouldn&apos;t be an excuse for a &quot;high end&quot; restaurant. They couldn&apos;t find our prepaid $45 reservations and they don&apos;t have 70% of the menu. We weren&apos;t told this until after we already sat down. I had 4 choices to pick from prior to my arrival and they don&apos;t have every single one of them. We had to rush to order and was completely off guard by the lack of choices. I heard raving reviews of this place and always wanted to give it a try. I support my local restaurants and businesses and this is not a good representation. I only have it 2 stars since they were somewhat accommodating to not being able to find our prepaid reservation and the mask policy is strictly enforced. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star.

Update: the server and manager were apologetic about our experience. Therefore, I upped it another star."
4,"Went for Sunday brunch on 11/22 in the igloos. Great staff, I mean stellar, excellent people. They provided recommendations, knew the menu (super important), and were honest - just down right awesome service. I was not a fan of the hash browns though. The menu literally says &quot;hash browns&quot; but they are deep fried in butter and they were very crispy like hard(maybe some people like that).  

The domes are not heated I would suggest dressing warm, and there is metered parking in walking distance. I loved the new branada toast (it&apos;s not avocado toast although it looks like it on Instagram). The chicken and dumplings were good, skillet looked good really can&apos;t go wrong."
5,"Had a fantastic experience at publican. Beer and wine list is so well rounded, truly something for everyone. We had the scallops, bread and fish dip, oysters, bbq carrots and charc plate. Everything was FANTASTIC! My fiancé a little bummed because ham plate was taken off of menu."
4,"Outdoor seating with translucent pods is a thing and it looks cool. This block of Fulton St is lined with them and you need to have your selfie taken here. 

The publican does comfort food right. By it self the dishes were fine taken as a whole, they take it up a notch. 

The farm chicken with au jus on a bed of French fries is having not only a savory and well seasoned bird but is like having poutine at the same time. The side sausage is good counter to the richness of the bird. By the way the dark meat is absolutely delicious.

The BBQ carrot tasted like meat carrot. It did not taste like a vegetable. Our server suggested the mussels which my wife and son really liked. The bread it came with was excellent. 

Fulton is now bougie - that comes with prices to match just be aware of that when you dine here."
4,"The Publican is a must visit in Chicago for brunch! And during COVID and indoor dining shutdown, they offer outdoor tent dining or individual bubble/ house dining (requires $150 deposit which is non-refundable and is applied towards your restaurant bill.) -- We did the tent and we&apos;re plenty warm. You can make reservations online, but we were able to get a table on Sunday in 45° weather without a reservation. The service was good and the food was delicious! I ordered a bourbon cream coffee which was a bit too bourbony for me, but I think bourbon lovers would go nuts for this! -- Will definitely be back to try more dishes!"
3,"We ate in one of the igloos- &quot;private domes&quot;- they are not heated. The reservation system says &quot;dine without the elements.&quot; You are in the elements when it is cold out, the description is quite misleading. The igloos also have an open flap which also lets a lot of heat escape. 
This should also be made clear when making a reservation and paying a non refundable $200 deposit. Overall food was great, naturally got cold fast but the courses were well spaced. The service was a bit slow especially for how few tables there were."
1,"Terrible service.No hospitality.
We booked the weekend brunch and when we arrived we had to wait a lot until seated then waited again for the order...and again when checking out.our server was cold and showed no hospitality.
There was a lot of trashes around our outdoor seating.
Very, very unpleasant.
Our server told us that  waffle and schnitzel were unavailable, at the timing of ordering , but he should have informed us before...
And food was also average, blunt, no surprise.
Just very much pricey for their portion.
And they charged us full price though we already put $30 in advance , when we booked online...so we had to ask the server to correct it.
Never come back."
5,"Let&apos;s shine a spotlight on another restaurant that has been truly amazing during the pandemic. 

First, the food is great, even if you don&apos;t order pork. The roast chicken is delicious, with a nicely salty sauce that goes perfectly on their fries, and the sides are interesting, textured, satisfying, and creative. I&apos;m thinking of the bbq carrots with ranch sauce, the burrata with tons of veggies, etc. And the desserts - an important and tough test in my household - are superlative. 

Second, they deliver! To Hyde Park! I don&apos;t mind doing some curbside pickup when I have to, but with little kids at home and Chicago traffic being what it is, I award a huge premium to any place that will give me 30-60 minutes of my life back by delivering to my door. Down here in the ivory tower we don&apos;t have a ton of amazing delivery options. But Publican is one of them.

Third, the customer service goes above and beyond. We had planned out a great spread for a Friday night dinner. The spread arrived, but missing our roast chicken. Hamlet without the prince and all that. Many restaurants would have just apologized and refunded the chicken. But the Publican recognized that without the chicken, dinner was ruined. They rushed the chicken through the kitchen and packed it into an Uber Connect. It arrived before we were done with the first course, and saved the day. And on top of that, they added a loaf of the best Publican bread for free. And they STILL refunded the chicken. 

When I worry about whether the Chicago restaurant scene will survive the pandemic, I think: as long as places like the Publican survive, we will be ok."
4,"Great local food on the main drag on Fulton&apos;s restaurant row. They offer &quot;greenhouse&quot; private dining pods outside with a min. Purchase deposit, which we found quite nice and intimate and well as safe from COVID. Food is to be shared amongst guests and doesn&apos;t come out as a meal but more like tapas. We tried the homemade bread, mussels, shrimp, and scallops- all with lots of fresh herbs and tons of flavor."
4,"We had a really great time here. Beer was great, oysters were great, the bread and dip trio was great! The pork belly for me was just OK and the service also seemed a tiny bit lacking, but overall super glad we decided to make reservations here."
5,"Gotta call in advance and reserve you spot. Decided to check this place out after watching this show called , F*ck that&apos;s delicious, and oh my it really is !!!! We ordered the soft shell crab, oysters and pork belly and frites. That was enough for 2 people. Ambience was nice on a busy Friday night During the pandemic.. but they were extra careful and did what they need to do to make sure everyone stays safe. Really love the food here and can&apos;t wait to come back."
4,"This place is not cheap, but it is ideal for special occasions. 

We started with oysters and a cheese plate, which set the tone for my excellent scallops."
5,"Loved having brunch here! 
Their Covid precautions were well organized and clean. 

The food was amazing! The pork belly was so crispy, chewy, and flavorful. The Biscuit Sandwich with Flank Steak was also a great meal that hit the spot. The different ingredients and condiments in the sandwich complimented each other so well! My favorite was the Belgian waffle. It was so light and crispy, yet was still chewy and so delicious. The jam and butter that came with it was also the perfect complement to the syrup!

Definitely want to come again next time I&apos;m in town!"
5,"Delicious authentic Southern food from New Orleans in Chicago at the Publican. The cute, cozy, and safe dining experience in their private greenhouses. Make sure to dress warm and enjoy the experience."
5,"The ambience at The Publican is great for groups. I highly recommend making a reservation. They have communal seating so go in with the expectation that you might be seated at a table with strangers, but take advantage of it and have fun! I personally recommend the communal seating for large groups; for dates, request a booth for some more privacy and intimacy.

Dishes are family style, so I recommend ordering two dishes per person. I honestly enjoyed every dish that I ordered. The potted rillettes were my favourite. There was a great balance of savouriness and sweetness. The sourdough bread was smokey and had the right crispiness, adding texture to the dish.
The honeycrisp apple tartine was refreshing. It had a nice level of acidity that cut through the richness of another dish, the pork shank, that I had. The pork shank was tender. The sauce/jus was delicious with thin slices of mango in it.

I highly recommend The Publican. I would gladly come back to try some other dishes on the menu. I also look forward to going to another restaurant by Paul Kahan."
4,"Great food but VERY pricey for the portion sizes you get. The plates are meant to be shared between a few people but in my opinion, it was more like a plate for one (maybe I just eat too much). My boyfriend took me here for dinner and we enjoyed everything. The restaurant is very family style in terms of seating, which makes the place feel homey and welcoming. There are giant pig paintings on the walls. 

Our service was wonderful. Our waters got refilled very quickly, our plates and utensils got switched out after every plate, we got checked up on often, and when one of us went to the bathroom, our napkin would get refolded and placed nicely by the staff. 

We started out with the chef selection of oysters (6/$18). They came out with a little sheet that explained where they were from and their taste. My favorite are earthy west coast oysters. 

For shareable plates, we ordered the hamachi crudo, pork belly, and sirloin. The pork belly was so tender that you aren&apos;t even given a knife to cut it. It was amazing and melt in your mouth. If you don&apos;t like fatty pork belly, you will probably not like this. The hamachi crudo was very fresh, the calamansi vinegar gave it a nice kick. The dry aged sirloin was also quite good with the cashew butter. 

We finished off with some mead and goat/sheep cheese platter. I&apos;ll be coming back to try the brunch next time."
5,"My wife and I got a well earned getaway weekend for our 10th anniversary! We decided to check out a new place we&apos;d never been to before. I had heard from several others that this place was outstanding so we decided to make a reservation for 6pm on their patio.

They offered patio or indoor seating and with the current COVID-19 Protocols we felt better about being outside. We felt very comfortable as we sat under their heat lamps and had a nice romantic dinner.

We started with their bread, which was about $9. I&apos;d say it&apos;s on the better end of the spectrum but certainly not worth the money. I mean, it&apos;s bread! 

Next we had the apple salad which was outstanding. I&apos;m not a huge apple fan but their salad blended sweet with spicy and was just the best. Then we ordered scallops and pork belly and were mesmerized by both. We decided to share everything and didn&apos;t regret it as we enjoyed every single dish they brought out. 

I would highly recommend this place to those seeking a &quot;close to normal&quot; dining experience!"
5,"If Covid&apos;s got you down and you want an excellent date night out with perfect food &amp; beverage, this is THE spot. Safe &amp; socially distant, and the menu is outstanding. They execute to perfection.

Since I&apos;m thorough, below is what we had:

Two kinds of west coast oysters I&apos;ve never had from Samich Bay, Washington: Samich Pearl (left) and Penn Cove (right). These are both third best in my mind next to Kumamotos and Kusshis. Loved em! 

Steak tartare with some seriously amazing *perfect* seeded rye bread, fresno chili dijonaise and fried shallot.

Midwestern cheese plate with fresh chevre, brie, and an ash rind gooey cheese, fennel roasted candied cashews, apricot preserves, and sweet cherries.

Not pictured, a lovely glass of Spanish cava paired with the oysters and a glass of French bordeaux just because. Plus, my hubby&apos;s Westmalle Dubbel beer which was on draft. The place has an extensive Belgian beer list, a well curated wine list, and pretty cocktails.
