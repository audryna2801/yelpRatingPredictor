5,"I am passionate about Jeni&apos;s ice cream and made the hike to stock up on pints! It&apos;s an investment, but well worth the drive and the price tag. Over 20 flavors of pints were in stock, including my favorites: lavender and brambleberry! 

Perfect service. No line. Super COVID safety precautions. This is a great location, too. Easy Park &amp; Pay street parking. It only cost me 53 cents to park!"
5,"It&apos;s finally summer and now I want ice cream everyday! This location is open for pick up only - so order online first. It&apos;s pints only but it&apos;s ready ASAP, so basically you could order when you get there or whenever the craving strikes! 

Anyways, the skillet cinnamon roll and the sweet cream biscuits and peach jam are my legitimate favorite flavors! Of all year round flavors - these are the cream of the crop. $12 pints is a little steep but when it&apos;s $5-6 for two scoops it actually is reasonably for an entire pint. If you choose only one, get the skillet cinnamon roll pint. You won&apos;t be sorry!!! 

You can add waffle cone, or pieces of cones and sprinkles to your order too !"
4,"It&apos;s taken me awhile to jump on the Jeni&apos;s train because the first few times I went I wasn&apos;t wowed by any flavors unlike the many people I know who rant any rave about it.

However, I recently gave it another try and really enjoyed it! I&apos;m not sure if I just never tried the right flavors for my palate or if my taste buds have changed or what. 

I will also say the staff is always great and the space is cool and clean."
4,"Love me some Jeni&apos;s - I&apos;ve been to all of the Jeni&apos;s locations in Chicago and LA by now. I love many of the flavors here, but my ultimate fave is the Brown Butter Almond Brittle. During a recent visit, I tried the split scoop of Coffee with Cream &amp; Sugar and the Brambleberry Crisp. Great blend of flavors and the creaminess of Jeni&apos;s flavors is unparalleled. Sure, prices are high but worth it for me!"
5,"The best freaking ice cream ever. Tried Jeni&apos;s for the first time after hearing everyone hype about it and although it is a tad bit pricey, it is so worth it. They have such unique flavors im sad I didn&apos;t get to try them all but brambleberru crisp was my favorite. Will definitely be coming back again!"
3,"We came to Jeni&apos;s on a Saturday night. The line was pretty long but went by quick!

The service was great and the cashier was very patient as I was trying to figure out what to get. 

The ice cream was good but in my opinion, a little over priced and over rated. I wish they had more of a variety of chocolate options. The chocolate options were a bit bland: milk, dark, etc. It would&apos;ve been nice to have flavors like oreo, chocolate chip, snickers.

Overall, I&apos;d go back if the people who I was with wanted to, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;d go out of my way to get it!"
5,"Man . This place is hot fire . The flavors are amazing and the staff is super friendly. .
I would 100% recommend trying the flavors (they&apos;re super nice about trying different options) but I got the bramble berry and salted peanut butter and they were absolutely amazing ."
4,"I have been to Jeni&apos;s many times before covid. My friends love it and there are vegan options for me! In the times that I have gone, they have had 4 vegan flavors. Texas sheet cake, cold brew, frose, and roasted PB. I have tried them all and just from my flavor palate, I only ever get roasted PB. I LOVE peanut butter. However, my non-vegan friends have really enjoyed the other flavors! It is good...but I wouldn&apos;t say its the best vegan ice cream I have had. Perhaps it is because I used to live in a place with so many specialty ice cream places - some that were completely vegan. This is really good and its always so nice going to a scoop shop. But not incredible for vegans. I am really excited to try their two new vegan flavors after covid though!"
4,"We came here on a hot weekday afternoon and luckily didn&apos;t experience any long lines. Don&apos;t come here if you&apos;re looking for your traditional ice cream flavors. Jeni&apos;s offers a lot more than that, and it works! 

We weren&apos;t that hungry to each have our own cones so we opted for their their trio sampler. We ordered their Salty caramel, cold brew with coconut cream, and frose sorbet. The frose sorbet was my least favorite. A sangria style frozen rose, with pear, strawberry and watermelon. It was refreshing, just didn&apos;t taste all that great. The salty caramel was good, a nice balance with sweet and salt, but my favorite was their cold brew with coconut cream. Cold brew coffee with a hint of coconut in every bite. Definitely a must try. They even add a chip of a waffle cone. A nice touch indeed. Next time we come back, we&apos;re going to come with a bigger appetite so we can each order our own cone."
5,"There are so, so many amazing flavors to choose from! I always try a few new flavors, but my go to combo is Darkest Chocolate (so rich, not too sweet) and Wildberry Lavender (floral, juicy, truly incredible). 

Their seasonal flavors are also really great! There&apos;s currently Banana Brulee which I really enjoyed, and I&apos;m secretly hoping Pear Riesling and Orange Blossom Chiffon make a comeback at some point."
5,"The smell of waffle cones whisks you in from down the street.  Amazing environment and friendly, patient staff, they allow you to sample as many flavors as you want and are so accommodating.  There is sometimes a line but the wait is worth it, and the flavors explode in your mouth like no other.  It is homemade, fresh and unlike anything you have had before. The waffle cones are made fresh daily and taste like a dream.  You can split flavors and do half and half if you would like."
5,Jeni&apos;s ice cream is proof that dreams do come true. Can&apos;t go wrong with literally any flavor. Always get the waffle cone.
5,Jeni&apos;s never disappoints me! I go to Jeni&apos;s every time I am in Chicago! The flavors are unique and you are able to sample flavors to help you decide what you like! This time I got the flavor pineapple upside down cake in a waffle cone! It was delicious and not overly fruit and there were many pieces of cake in the ice cream! When you go to Jeni&apos;s the waffle cone is a must! They are made in house! Jeni&apos;s splendid is a must go to on your next Chicago trip or next ice cream outing!
5,"Wow, really loved the mix of flavors they offer here. Highly recommend the salted peanut butter with chocolate chunks in it. My boyfriend liked the goat cheese with cherry and the darkest chocolate. Also love that it comes with a little waffle cone sliver. The woman who helped us was also lovely.

One of the best things unrelated to the actual ice cream: they use REAL spoons not PLASTIC!! thank you for choosing a more sustainable option instead of wasting hundreds of tiny plastic spoons every day!!! Such an awesome surprise to be handed an actual metal spoon. They also use paper cups that aren&apos;t coated in wax or plastic so they are easier to discard properly. Great place!"
5,Always love Jeni&apos;s!! I&apos;ve been to locations across the country and none of them ever disappoint. Even the sorbet flavors are amazing! Plenty of dairy free options for vegan/lactose-intolerant people.
5,"I have always wanted to try her ice cream and boy was it worth the hype! Luckily stumbled upon this place while in Wicker Park. Each flavor was striking. You are allowed to sample before committing to flavors which is great for an indecisive person like me. I tried the most popular ones but went with salted peanut butter with chocolate flecks, frose sorbet, and coffee with cream &amp; sugar. I can honestly say I loved each flavor and the waffle chip! I should buy a pint at a grocery store since there aren&apos;t any Jeni&apos;s in NYC."
5,Jeni&apos;s is the best ice cream you will ever eat in your life! But they do sell it cheaper at foxtrot market for $10.00 a pint
5,"Love it! This treasure of flavor and happiness draws us to visit even in the dead of winter. The seasonal flavors are unique and limited. So, don&apos;t fall in love. 

Well worth tHe wait if there is a line and you can always bring a pint home!"
4,"Jeni&apos;s offers a wide variety of flavors and is generous with their sampling! We waited in line for about ten minutes to order and were really surprised at just how many flavors they will let you try. The person in front of us tried upwards of ten! 

We ourselves tried a couple for the experience but knew what we wanted after family had sent us a sampler pack in the mail a few months prior. We split a gooey butter cake single in a bowl which was served with a piece of freshly made waffle cone. It was a nice surprise as the aroma of freshly made cones filled the entire parlor and a member of the team was busy making cone after cone.

The ice cream is rich and creamy, but not too heavy. Sharing a bowl was the perfect snack as we took a break from shopping. It&apos;s nice that there are several locations and that they will ship across the United States as a unique gift idea. 

Overall, we&apos;ve enjoyed their ice creams and likely will stop in again on out next trip."
5,Having a splendid good time  Imagine this: fresh cinnamon sugar waffle cone smells waft through the air inviting you to escape from the cold Chicago wind. The flavors are endless as you try 8 hoping and wishing you had the metabolism and $$$$ to get ALL 8 flavors but alas you had to settle for two: Gooey Butter Cake and Peppermint White Mocha. You finish the entire bowl feeling satisfied knowing damn well you&apos;ll be back to take on the rest. The end.

4,"I have been to Jeni&apos;s many times before covid. My friends love it and there are vegan options for me! In the times that I have gone, they have had 4 vegan flavors. Texas sheet cake, cold brew, frose, and roasted PB. I have tried them all and just from my flavor palate, I only ever get roasted PB. I LOVE peanut butter. However, my non-vegan friends have really enjoyed the other flavors! It is good...but I wouldn&apos;t say its the best vegan ice cream I have had. Perhaps it is because I used to live in a place with so many specialty ice cream places - some that were completely vegan. This is really good and its always so nice going to a scoop shop. But not incredible for vegans. I am really excited to try their two new vegan flavors after covid though!"
4,"We came here on a hot weekday afternoon and luckily didn&apos;t experience any long lines. Don&apos;t come here if you&apos;re looking for your traditional ice cream flavors. Jeni&apos;s offers a lot more than that, and it works! 

We weren&apos;t that hungry to each have our own cones so we opted for their their trio sampler. We ordered their Salty caramel, cold brew with coconut cream, and frose sorbet. The frose sorbet was my least favorite. A sangria style frozen rose, with pear, strawberry and watermelon. It was refreshing, just didn&apos;t taste all that great. The salty caramel was good, a nice balance with sweet and salt, but my favorite was their cold brew with coconut cream. Cold brew coffee with a hint of coconut in every bite. Definitely a must try. They even add a chip of a waffle cone. A nice touch indeed. Next time we come back, we&apos;re going to come with a bigger appetite so we can each order our own cone."
5,"There are so, so many amazing flavors to choose from! I always try a few new flavors, but my go to combo is Darkest Chocolate (so rich, not too sweet) and Wildberry Lavender (floral, juicy, truly incredible). 

Their seasonal flavors are also really great! There&apos;s currently Banana Brulee which I really enjoyed, and I&apos;m secretly hoping Pear Riesling and Orange Blossom Chiffon make a comeback at some point."
5,"The smell of waffle cones whisks you in from down the street.  Amazing environment and friendly, patient staff, they allow you to sample as many flavors as you want and are so accommodating.  There is sometimes a line but the wait is worth it, and the flavors explode in your mouth like no other.  It is homemade, fresh and unlike anything you have had before. The waffle cones are made fresh daily and taste like a dream.  You can split flavors and do half and half if you would like."
5,Jeni&apos;s ice cream is proof that dreams do come true. Can&apos;t go wrong with literally any flavor. Always get the waffle cone.
5,Jeni&apos;s never disappoints me! I go to Jeni&apos;s every time I am in Chicago! The flavors are unique and you are able to sample flavors to help you decide what you like! This time I got the flavor pineapple upside down cake in a waffle cone! It was delicious and not overly fruit and there were many pieces of cake in the ice cream! When you go to Jeni&apos;s the waffle cone is a must! They are made in house! Jeni&apos;s splendid is a must go to on your next Chicago trip or next ice cream outing!
5,"Wow, really loved the mix of flavors they offer here. Highly recommend the salted peanut butter with chocolate chunks in it. My boyfriend liked the goat cheese with cherry and the darkest chocolate. Also love that it comes with a little waffle cone sliver. The woman who helped us was also lovely.

One of the best things unrelated to the actual ice cream: they use REAL spoons not PLASTIC!! thank you for choosing a more sustainable option instead of wasting hundreds of tiny plastic spoons every day!!! Such an awesome surprise to be handed an actual metal spoon. They also use paper cups that aren&apos;t coated in wax or plastic so they are easier to discard properly. Great place!"
5,Always love Jeni&apos;s!! I&apos;ve been to locations across the country and none of them ever disappoint. Even the sorbet flavors are amazing! Plenty of dairy free options for vegan/lactose-intolerant people.
5,"I have always wanted to try her ice cream and boy was it worth the hype! Luckily stumbled upon this place while in Wicker Park. Each flavor was striking. You are allowed to sample before committing to flavors which is great for an indecisive person like me. I tried the most popular ones but went with salted peanut butter with chocolate flecks, frose sorbet, and coffee with cream &amp; sugar. I can honestly say I loved each flavor and the waffle chip! I should buy a pint at a grocery store since there aren&apos;t any Jeni&apos;s in NYC."
5,Jeni&apos;s is the best ice cream you will ever eat in your life! But they do sell it cheaper at foxtrot market for $10.00 a pint
5,"Love it! This treasure of flavor and happiness draws us to visit even in the dead of winter. The seasonal flavors are unique and limited. So, don&apos;t fall in love. 

Well worth tHe wait if there is a line and you can always bring a pint home!"
4,"Jeni&apos;s offers a wide variety of flavors and is generous with their sampling! We waited in line for about ten minutes to order and were really surprised at just how many flavors they will let you try. The person in front of us tried upwards of ten! 

We ourselves tried a couple for the experience but knew what we wanted after family had sent us a sampler pack in the mail a few months prior. We split a gooey butter cake single in a bowl which was served with a piece of freshly made waffle cone. It was a nice surprise as the aroma of freshly made cones filled the entire parlor and a member of the team was busy making cone after cone.

The ice cream is rich and creamy, but not too heavy. Sharing a bowl was the perfect snack as we took a break from shopping. It&apos;s nice that there are several locations and that they will ship across the United States as a unique gift idea. 

Overall, we&apos;ve enjoyed their ice creams and likely will stop in again on out next trip."
5,Having a splendid good time  Imagine this: fresh cinnamon sugar waffle cone smells waft through the air inviting you to escape from the cold Chicago wind. The flavors are endless as you try 8 hoping and wishing you had the metabolism and $$$$ to get ALL 8 flavors but alas you had to settle for two: Gooey Butter Cake and Peppermint White Mocha. You finish the entire bowl feeling satisfied knowing damn well you&apos;ll be back to take on the rest. The end.
5,"I am passionate about Jeni&apos;s ice cream and made the hike to stock up on pints! It&apos;s an investment, but well worth the drive and the price tag. Over 20 flavors of pints were in stock, including my favorites: lavender and brambleberry! 

Perfect service. No line. Super COVID safety precautions. This is a great location, too. Easy Park &amp; Pay street parking. It only cost me 53 cents to park!"
5,"It&apos;s finally summer and now I want ice cream everyday! This location is open for pick up only - so order online first. It&apos;s pints only but it&apos;s ready ASAP, so basically you could order when you get there or whenever the craving strikes! 

Anyways, the skillet cinnamon roll and the sweet cream biscuits and peach jam are my legitimate favorite flavors! Of all year round flavors - these are the cream of the crop. $12 pints is a little steep but when it&apos;s $5-6 for two scoops it actually is reasonably for an entire pint. If you choose only one, get the skillet cinnamon roll pint. You won&apos;t be sorry!!! 

You can add waffle cone, or pieces of cones and sprinkles to your order too !"
4,"It&apos;s taken me awhile to jump on the Jeni&apos;s train because the first few times I went I wasn&apos;t wowed by any flavors unlike the many people I know who rant any rave about it.

However, I recently gave it another try and really enjoyed it! I&apos;m not sure if I just never tried the right flavors for my palate or if my taste buds have changed or what. 

I will also say the staff is always great and the space is cool and clean."
4,"Love me some Jeni&apos;s - I&apos;ve been to all of the Jeni&apos;s locations in Chicago and LA by now. I love many of the flavors here, but my ultimate fave is the Brown Butter Almond Brittle. During a recent visit, I tried the split scoop of Coffee with Cream &amp; Sugar and the Brambleberry Crisp. Great blend of flavors and the creaminess of Jeni&apos;s flavors is unparalleled. Sure, prices are high but worth it for me!"
5,"The best freaking ice cream ever. Tried Jeni&apos;s for the first time after hearing everyone hype about it and although it is a tad bit pricey, it is so worth it. They have such unique flavors im sad I didn&apos;t get to try them all but brambleberru crisp was my favorite. Will definitely be coming back again!"
3,"We came to Jeni&apos;s on a Saturday night. The line was pretty long but went by quick!

The service was great and the cashier was very patient as I was trying to figure out what to get. 

The ice cream was good but in my opinion, a little over priced and over rated. I wish they had more of a variety of chocolate options. The chocolate options were a bit bland: milk, dark, etc. It would&apos;ve been nice to have flavors like oreo, chocolate chip, snickers.

Overall, I&apos;d go back if the people who I was with wanted to, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;d go out of my way to get it!"

When you go to Jeni&apos;s the waffle cone is a must! They are made in house! Jeni&apos;s splendid is a must go to on your next Chicago trip or next ice cream outing!
5,"Wow, really loved the mix of flavors they offer here. Highly recommend the salted peanut butter with chocolate chunks in it. My boyfriend liked the goat cheese with cherry and the darkest chocolate. Also love that it comes with a little waffle cone sliver. The woman who helped us was also lovely.

One of the best things unrelated to the actual ice cream: they use REAL spoons not PLASTIC!! thank you for choosing a more sustainable option instead of wasting hundreds of tiny plastic spoons every day!!! Such an awesome surprise to be handed an actual metal spoon. They also use paper cups that aren&apos;t coated in wax or plastic so they are easier to discard properly. Great place!"
5,Always love Jeni&apos;s!! I&apos;ve been to locations across the country and none of them ever disappoint. Even the sorbet flavors are amazing! Plenty of dairy free options for vegan/lactose-intolerant people.
5,"I have always wanted to try her ice cream and boy was it worth the hype! Luckily stumbled upon this place while in Wicker Park. Each flavor was striking. You are allowed to sample before committing to flavors which is great for an indecisive person like me. I tried the most popular ones but went with salted peanut butter with chocolate flecks, frose sorbet, and coffee with cream &amp; sugar. I can honestly say I loved each flavor and the waffle chip! I should buy a pint at a grocery store since there aren&apos;t any Jeni&apos;s in NYC."
5,Jeni&apos;s is the best ice cream you will ever eat in your life! But they do sell it cheaper at foxtrot market for $10.00 a pint
5,"Love it! This treasure of flavor and happiness draws us to visit even in the dead of winter. The seasonal flavors are unique and limited. So, don&apos;t fall in love. 

Well worth tHe wait if there is a line and you can always bring a pint home!"
4,"Jeni&apos;s offers a wide variety of flavors and is generous with their sampling! We waited in line for about ten minutes to order and were really surprised at just how many flavors they will let you try. The person in front of us tried upwards of ten! 

We ourselves tried a couple for the experience but knew what we wanted after family had sent us a sampler pack in the mail a few months prior. We split a gooey butter cake single in a bowl which was served with a piece of freshly made waffle cone. It was a nice surprise as the aroma of freshly made cones filled the entire parlor and a member of the team was busy making cone after cone.

The ice cream is rich and creamy, but not too heavy. Sharing a bowl was the perfect snack as we took a break from shopping. It&apos;s nice that there are several locations and that they will ship across the United States as a unique gift idea. 

Overall, we&apos;ve enjoyed their ice creams and likely will stop in again on out next trip."
5,Having a splendid good time  Imagine this: fresh cinnamon sugar waffle cone smells waft through the air inviting you to escape from the cold Chicago wind. The flavors are endless as you try 8 hoping and wishing you had the metabolism and $$$$ to get ALL 8 flavors but alas you had to settle for two: Gooey Butter Cake and Peppermint White Mocha. You finish the entire bowl feeling satisfied knowing damn well you&apos;ll be back to take on the rest. The end.
5,"I am passionate about Jeni&apos;s ice cream and made the hike to stock up on pints! It&apos;s an investment, but well worth the drive and the price tag. Over 20 flavors of pints were in stock, including my favorites: lavender and brambleberry! 

Perfect service. No line. Super COVID safety precautions. This is a great location, too. Easy Park &amp; Pay street parking. It only cost me 53 cents to park!"
5,"It&apos;s finally summer and now I want ice cream everyday! This location is open for pick up only - so order online first. It&apos;s pints only but it&apos;s ready ASAP, so basically you could order when you get there or whenever the craving strikes! 

Anyways, the skillet cinnamon roll and the sweet cream biscuits and peach jam are my legitimate favorite flavors! Of all year round flavors - these are the cream of the crop. $12 pints is a little steep but when it&apos;s $5-6 for two scoops it actually is reasonably for an entire pint. If you choose only one, get the skillet cinnamon roll pint. You won&apos;t be sorry!!! 

You can add waffle cone, or pieces of cones and sprinkles to your order too !"
4,"It&apos;s taken me awhile to jump on the Jeni&apos;s train because the first few times I went I wasn&apos;t wowed by any flavors unlike the many people I know who rant any rave about it.

However, I recently gave it another try and really enjoyed it! I&apos;m not sure if I just never tried the right flavors for my palate or if my taste buds have changed or what. 

I will also say the staff is always great and the space is cool and clean."
4,"Love me some Jeni&apos;s - I&apos;ve been to all of the Jeni&apos;s locations in Chicago and LA by now. I love many of the flavors here, but my ultimate fave is the Brown Butter Almond Brittle. During a recent visit, I tried the split scoop of Coffee with Cream &amp; Sugar and the Brambleberry Crisp. Great blend of flavors and the creaminess of Jeni&apos;s flavors is unparalleled. Sure, prices are high but worth it for me!"
5,"The best freaking ice cream ever. Tried Jeni&apos;s for the first time after hearing everyone hype about it and although it is a tad bit pricey, it is so worth it. They have such unique flavors im sad I didn&apos;t get to try them all but brambleberru crisp was my favorite. Will definitely be coming back again!"
3,"We came to Jeni&apos;s on a Saturday night. The line was pretty long but went by quick!

The service was great and the cashier was very patient as I was trying to figure out what to get. 

The ice cream was good but in my opinion, a little over priced and over rated. I wish they had more of a variety of chocolate options. The chocolate options were a bit bland: milk, dark, etc. It would&apos;ve been nice to have flavors like oreo, chocolate chip, snickers.

Overall, I&apos;d go back if the people who I was with wanted to, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;d go out of my way to get it!"
5,"Man . This place is hot fire . The flavors are amazing and the staff is super friendly. .
I would 100% recommend trying the flavors (they&apos;re super nice about trying different options) but I got the bramble berry and salted peanut butter and they were absolutely amazing ."
4,"I have been to Jeni&apos;s many times before covid. My friends love it and there are vegan options for me! In the times that I have gone, they have had 4 vegan flavors. Texas sheet cake, cold brew, frose, and roasted PB. I have tried them all and just from my flavor palate, I only ever get roasted PB. I LOVE peanut butter. However, my non-vegan friends have really enjoyed the other flavors! It is good...but I wouldn&apos;t say its the best vegan ice cream I have had. Perhaps it is because I used to live in a place with so many specialty ice cream places - some that were completely vegan. This is really good and its always so nice going to a scoop shop. But not incredible for vegans. I am really excited to try their two new vegan flavors after covid though!"
4,"We came here on a hot weekday afternoon and luckily didn&apos;t experience any long lines. Don&apos;t come here if you&apos;re looking for your traditional ice cream flavors. Jeni&apos;s offers a lot more than that, and it works! 

We weren&apos;t that hungry to each have our own cones so we opted for their their trio sampler. We ordered their Salty caramel, cold brew with coconut cream, and frose sorbet. The frose sorbet was my least favorite. A sangria style frozen rose, with pear, strawberry and watermelon. It was refreshing, just didn&apos;t taste all that great. The salty caramel was good, a nice balance with sweet and salt, but my favorite was their cold brew with coconut cream. Cold brew coffee with a hint of coconut in every bite. Definitely a must try. They even add a chip of a waffle cone. A nice touch indeed. Next time we come back, we&apos;re going to come with a bigger appetite so we can each order our own cone."
5,"There are so, so many amazing flavors to choose from! I always try a few new flavors, but my go to combo is Darkest Chocolate (so rich, not too sweet) and Wildberry Lavender (floral, juicy, truly incredible). 

Their seasonal flavors are also really great! There&apos;s currently Banana Brulee which I really enjoyed, and I&apos;m secretly hoping Pear Riesling and Orange Blossom Chiffon make a comeback at some point."
5,"The smell of waffle cones whisks you in from down the street.  Amazing environment and friendly, patient staff, they allow you to sample as many flavors as you want and are so accommodating.  There is sometimes a line but the wait is worth it, and the flavors explode in your mouth like no other.  It is homemade, fresh and unlike anything you have had before. The waffle cones are made fresh daily and taste like a dream.  You can split flavors and do half and half if you would like."
5,Jeni&apos;s ice cream is proof that dreams do come true. Can&apos;t go wrong with literally any flavor. Always get the waffle cone.

The flavors are endless as you try 8 hoping and wishing you had the metabolism and $$$$ to get ALL 8 flavors but alas you had to settle for two: Gooey Butter Cake and Peppermint White Mocha. You finish the entire bowl feeling satisfied knowing damn well you&apos;ll be back to take on the rest. The end.
5,"I am passionate about Jeni&apos;s ice cream and made the hike to stock up on pints! It&apos;s an investment, but well worth the drive and the price tag. Over 20 flavors of pints were in stock, including my favorites: lavender and brambleberry! 

Perfect service. No line. Super COVID safety precautions. This is a great location, too. Easy Park &amp; Pay street parking. It only cost me 53 cents to park!"
5,"It&apos;s finally summer and now I want ice cream everyday! This location is open for pick up only - so order online first. It&apos;s pints only but it&apos;s ready ASAP, so basically you could order when you get there or whenever the craving strikes! 

Anyways, the skillet cinnamon roll and the sweet cream biscuits and peach jam are my legitimate favorite flavors! Of all year round flavors - these are the cream of the crop. $12 pints is a little steep but when it&apos;s $5-6 for two scoops it actually is reasonably for an entire pint. If you choose only one, get the skillet cinnamon roll pint. You won&apos;t be sorry!!! 

You can add waffle cone, or pieces of cones and sprinkles to your order too !"
4,"It&apos;s taken me awhile to jump on the Jeni&apos;s train because the first few times I went I wasn&apos;t wowed by any flavors unlike the many people I know who rant any rave about it.

However, I recently gave it another try and really enjoyed it! I&apos;m not sure if I just never tried the right flavors for my palate or if my taste buds have changed or what. 

I will also say the staff is always great and the space is cool and clean."
4,"Love me some Jeni&apos;s - I&apos;ve been to all of the Jeni&apos;s locations in Chicago and LA by now. I love many of the flavors here, but my ultimate fave is the Brown Butter Almond Brittle. During a recent visit, I tried the split scoop of Coffee with Cream &amp; Sugar and the Brambleberry Crisp. Great blend of flavors and the creaminess of Jeni&apos;s flavors is unparalleled. Sure, prices are high but worth it for me!"
5,"The best freaking ice cream ever. Tried Jeni&apos;s for the first time after hearing everyone hype about it and although it is a tad bit pricey, it is so worth it. They have such unique flavors im sad I didn&apos;t get to try them all but brambleberru crisp was my favorite. Will definitely be coming back again!"
3,"We came to Jeni&apos;s on a Saturday night. The line was pretty long but went by quick!

The service was great and the cashier was very patient as I was trying to figure out what to get. 

The ice cream was good but in my opinion, a little over priced and over rated. I wish they had more of a variety of chocolate options. The chocolate options were a bit bland: milk, dark, etc. It would&apos;ve been nice to have flavors like oreo, chocolate chip, snickers.

Overall, I&apos;d go back if the people who I was with wanted to, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;d go out of my way to get it!"
5,"Man . This place is hot fire . The flavors are amazing and the staff is super friendly. .
I would 100% recommend trying the flavors (they&apos;re super nice about trying different options) but I got the bramble berry and salted peanut butter and they were absolutely amazing ."
4,"I have been to Jeni&apos;s many times before covid. My friends love it and there are vegan options for me! In the times that I have gone, they have had 4 vegan flavors. Texas sheet cake, cold brew, frose, and roasted PB. I have tried them all and just from my flavor palate, I only ever get roasted PB. I LOVE peanut butter. However, my non-vegan friends have really enjoyed the other flavors! It is good...but I wouldn&apos;t say its the best vegan ice cream I have had. Perhaps it is because I used to live in a place with so many specialty ice cream places - some that were completely vegan. This is really good and its always so nice going to a scoop shop. But not incredible for vegans. I am really excited to try their two new vegan flavors after covid though!"
4,"We came here on a hot weekday afternoon and luckily didn&apos;t experience any long lines. Don&apos;t come here if you&apos;re looking for your traditional ice cream flavors. Jeni&apos;s offers a lot more than that, and it works! 

We weren&apos;t that hungry to each have our own cones so we opted for their their trio sampler. We ordered their Salty caramel, cold brew with coconut cream, and frose sorbet. The frose sorbet was my least favorite. A sangria style frozen rose, with pear, strawberry and watermelon. It was refreshing, just didn&apos;t taste all that great. The salty caramel was good, a nice balance with sweet and salt, but my favorite was their cold brew with coconut cream. Cold brew coffee with a hint of coconut in every bite. Definitely a must try. They even add a chip of a waffle cone. A nice touch indeed. Next time we come back, we&apos;re going to come with a bigger appetite so we can each order our own cone."
5,"There are so, so many amazing flavors to choose from! I always try a few new flavors, but my go to combo is Darkest Chocolate (so rich, not too sweet) and Wildberry Lavender (floral, juicy, truly incredible). 

Their seasonal flavors are also really great! There&apos;s currently Banana Brulee which I really enjoyed, and I&apos;m secretly hoping Pear Riesling and Orange Blossom Chiffon make a comeback at some point."
5,"The smell of waffle cones whisks you in from down the street.  Amazing environment and friendly, patient staff, they allow you to sample as many flavors as you want and are so accommodating.  There is sometimes a line but the wait is worth it, and the flavors explode in your mouth like no other.  It is homemade, fresh and unlike anything you have had before. The waffle cones are made fresh daily and taste like a dream.  You can split flavors and do half and half if you would like."
5,Jeni&apos;s ice cream is proof that dreams do come true. Can&apos;t go wrong with literally any flavor. Always get the waffle cone.
5,Jeni&apos;s never disappoints me! I go to Jeni&apos;s every time I am in Chicago! The flavors are unique and you are able to sample flavors to help you decide what you like! This time I got the flavor pineapple upside down cake in a waffle cone! It was delicious and not overly fruit and there were many pieces of cake in the ice cream! When you go to Jeni&apos;s the waffle cone is a must! They are made in house! Jeni&apos;s splendid is a must go to on your next Chicago trip or next ice cream outing!
5,"Wow, really loved the mix of flavors they offer here. Highly recommend the salted peanut butter with chocolate chunks in it. My boyfriend liked the goat cheese with cherry and the darkest chocolate. Also love that it comes with a little waffle cone sliver. The woman who helped us was also lovely.

One of the best things unrelated to the actual ice cream: they use REAL spoons not PLASTIC!! thank you for choosing a more sustainable option instead of wasting hundreds of tiny plastic spoons every day!!! Such an awesome surprise to be handed an actual metal spoon. They also use paper cups that aren&apos;t coated in wax or plastic so they are easier to discard properly. Great place!"
5,Always love Jeni&apos;s!! I&apos;ve been to locations across the country and none of them ever disappoint. Even the sorbet flavors are amazing! Plenty of dairy free options for vegan/lactose-intolerant people.
5,"I have always wanted to try her ice cream and boy was it worth the hype! Luckily stumbled upon this place while in Wicker Park. Each flavor was striking. You are allowed to sample before committing to flavors which is great for an indecisive person like me. I tried the most popular ones but went with salted peanut butter with chocolate flecks, frose sorbet, and coffee with cream &amp; sugar. I can honestly say I loved each flavor and the waffle chip! I should buy a pint at a grocery store since there aren&apos;t any Jeni&apos;s in NYC."
5,Jeni&apos;s is the best ice cream you will ever eat in your life! But they do sell it cheaper at foxtrot market for $10.00 a pint
5,"Love it! This treasure of flavor and happiness draws us to visit even in the dead of winter. The seasonal flavors are unique and limited. So, don&apos;t fall in love. 

Well worth tHe wait if there is a line and you can always bring a pint home!"
4,"Jeni&apos;s offers a wide variety of flavors and is generous with their sampling! We waited in line for about ten minutes to order and were really surprised at just how many flavors they will let you try. The person in front of us tried upwards of ten! 

We ourselves tried a couple for the experience but knew what we wanted after family had sent us a sampler pack in the mail a few months prior. We split a gooey butter cake single in a bowl which was served with a piece of freshly made waffle cone. It was a nice surprise as the aroma of freshly made cones filled the entire parlor and a member of the team was busy making cone after cone.

The ice cream is rich and creamy, but not too heavy. Sharing a bowl was the perfect snack as we took a break from shopping. It&apos;s nice that there are several locations and that they will ship across the United States as a unique gift idea. 

Overall, we&apos;ve enjoyed their ice creams and likely will stop in again on out next trip."

The ice cream was good but in my opinion, a little over priced and over rated. I wish they had more of a variety of chocolate options. The chocolate options were a bit bland: milk, dark, etc. It would&apos;ve been nice to have flavors like oreo, chocolate chip, snickers.

Overall, I&apos;d go back if the people who I was with wanted to, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;d go out of my way to get it!"
5,"Man . This place is hot fire . The flavors are amazing and the staff is super friendly. .
I would 100% recommend trying the flavors (they&apos;re super nice about trying different options) but I got the bramble berry and salted peanut butter and they were absolutely amazing ."
4,"I have been to Jeni&apos;s many times before covid. My friends love it and there are vegan options for me! In the times that I have gone, they have had 4 vegan flavors. Texas sheet cake, cold brew, frose, and roasted PB. I have tried them all and just from my flavor palate, I only ever get roasted PB. I LOVE peanut butter. However, my non-vegan friends have really enjoyed the other flavors! It is good...but I wouldn&apos;t say its the best vegan ice cream I have had. Perhaps it is because I used to live in a place with so many specialty ice cream places - some that were completely vegan. This is really good and its always so nice going to a scoop shop. But not incredible for vegans. I am really excited to try their two new vegan flavors after covid though!"
4,"We came here on a hot weekday afternoon and luckily didn&apos;t experience any long lines. Don&apos;t come here if you&apos;re looking for your traditional ice cream flavors. Jeni&apos;s offers a lot more than that, and it works! 

We weren&apos;t that hungry to each have our own cones so we opted for their their trio sampler. We ordered their Salty caramel, cold brew with coconut cream, and frose sorbet. The frose sorbet was my least favorite. A sangria style frozen rose, with pear, strawberry and watermelon. It was refreshing, just didn&apos;t taste all that great. The salty caramel was good, a nice balance with sweet and salt, but my favorite was their cold brew with coconut cream. Cold brew coffee with a hint of coconut in every bite. Definitely a must try. They even add a chip of a waffle cone. A nice touch indeed. Next time we come back, we&apos;re going to come with a bigger appetite so we can each order our own cone."
5,"There are so, so many amazing flavors to choose from! I always try a few new flavors, but my go to combo is Darkest Chocolate (so rich, not too sweet) and Wildberry Lavender (floral, juicy, truly incredible). 

Their seasonal flavors are also really great! There&apos;s currently Banana Brulee which I really enjoyed, and I&apos;m secretly hoping Pear Riesling and Orange Blossom Chiffon make a comeback at some point."
5,"The smell of waffle cones whisks you in from down the street.  Amazing environment and friendly, patient staff, they allow you to sample as many flavors as you want and are so accommodating.  There is sometimes a line but the wait is worth it, and the flavors explode in your mouth like no other.  It is homemade, fresh and unlike anything you have had before. The waffle cones are made fresh daily and taste like a dream.  You can split flavors and do half and half if you would like."
5,Jeni&apos;s ice cream is proof that dreams do come true. Can&apos;t go wrong with literally any flavor. Always get the waffle cone.
5,Jeni&apos;s never disappoints me! I go to Jeni&apos;s every time I am in Chicago! The flavors are unique and you are able to sample flavors to help you decide what you like! This time I got the flavor pineapple upside down cake in a waffle cone! It was delicious and not overly fruit and there were many pieces of cake in the ice cream! When you go to Jeni&apos;s the waffle cone is a must! They are made in house! Jeni&apos;s splendid is a must go to on your next Chicago trip or next ice cream outing!
5,"Wow, really loved the mix of flavors they offer here. Highly recommend the salted peanut butter with chocolate chunks in it. My boyfriend liked the goat cheese with cherry and the darkest chocolate. Also love that it comes with a little waffle cone sliver. The woman who helped us was also lovely.

One of the best things unrelated to the actual ice cream: they use REAL spoons not PLASTIC!! thank you for choosing a more sustainable option instead of wasting hundreds of tiny plastic spoons every day!!! Such an awesome surprise to be handed an actual metal spoon. They also use paper cups that aren&apos;t coated in wax or plastic so they are easier to discard properly. Great place!"
5,Always love Jeni&apos;s!! I&apos;ve been to locations across the country and none of them ever disappoint. Even the sorbet flavors are amazing! Plenty of dairy free options for vegan/lactose-intolerant people.
5,"I have always wanted to try her ice cream and boy was it worth the hype! Luckily stumbled upon this place while in Wicker Park. Each flavor was striking. You are allowed to sample before committing to flavors which is great for an indecisive person like me. I tried the most popular ones but went with salted peanut butter with chocolate flecks, frose sorbet, and coffee with cream &amp; sugar. I can honestly say I loved each flavor and the waffle chip! I should buy a pint at a grocery store since there aren&apos;t any Jeni&apos;s in NYC."
5,Jeni&apos;s is the best ice cream you will ever eat in your life! But they do sell it cheaper at foxtrot market for $10.00 a pint
5,"Love it! This treasure of flavor and happiness draws us to visit even in the dead of winter. The seasonal flavors are unique and limited. So, don&apos;t fall in love. 

Well worth tHe wait if there is a line and you can always bring a pint home!"
4,"Jeni&apos;s offers a wide variety of flavors and is generous with their sampling! We waited in line for about ten minutes to order and were really surprised at just how many flavors they will let you try. The person in front of us tried upwards of ten! 

We ourselves tried a couple for the experience but knew what we wanted after family had sent us a sampler pack in the mail a few months prior. We split a gooey butter cake single in a bowl which was served with a piece of freshly made waffle cone. It was a nice surprise as the aroma of freshly made cones filled the entire parlor and a member of the team was busy making cone after cone.

The ice cream is rich and creamy, but not too heavy. Sharing a bowl was the perfect snack as we took a break from shopping. It&apos;s nice that there are several locations and that they will ship across the United States as a unique gift idea. 

Overall, we&apos;ve enjoyed their ice creams and likely will stop in again on out next trip."
5,Having a splendid good time  Imagine this: fresh cinnamon sugar waffle cone smells waft through the air inviting you to escape from the cold Chicago wind. The flavors are endless as you try 8 hoping and wishing you had the metabolism and $$$$ to get ALL 8 flavors but alas you had to settle for two: Gooey Butter Cake and Peppermint White Mocha. You finish the entire bowl feeling satisfied knowing damn well you&apos;ll be back to take on the rest. The end.
5,"I am passionate about Jeni&apos;s ice cream and made the hike to stock up on pints! It&apos;s an investment, but well worth the drive and the price tag. Over 20 flavors of pints were in stock, including my favorites: lavender and brambleberry! 

Perfect service. No line. Super COVID safety precautions. This is a great location, too. Easy Park &amp; Pay street parking. It only cost me 53 cents to park!"
5,"It&apos;s finally summer and now I want ice cream everyday! This location is open for pick up only - so order online first. It&apos;s pints only but it&apos;s ready ASAP, so basically you could order when you get there or whenever the craving strikes! 

Anyways, the skillet cinnamon roll and the sweet cream biscuits and peach jam are my legitimate favorite flavors! Of all year round flavors - these are the cream of the crop. $12 pints is a little steep but when it&apos;s $5-6 for two scoops it actually is reasonably for an entire pint. If you choose only one, get the skillet cinnamon roll pint. You won&apos;t be sorry!!! 

You can add waffle cone, or pieces of cones and sprinkles to your order too !"
4,"It&apos;s taken me awhile to jump on the Jeni&apos;s train because the first few times I went I wasn&apos;t wowed by any flavors unlike the many people I know who rant any rave about it.

However, I recently gave it another try and really enjoyed it! I&apos;m not sure if I just never tried the right flavors for my palate or if my taste buds have changed or what. 

I will also say the staff is always great and the space is cool and clean."
4,"Love me some Jeni&apos;s - I&apos;ve been to all of the Jeni&apos;s locations in Chicago and LA by now. I love many of the flavors here, but my ultimate fave is the Brown Butter Almond Brittle. During a recent visit, I tried the split scoop of Coffee with Cream &amp; Sugar and the Brambleberry Crisp. Great blend of flavors and the creaminess of Jeni&apos;s flavors is unparalleled. Sure, prices are high but worth it for me!"
5,"The best freaking ice cream ever. Tried Jeni&apos;s for the first time after hearing everyone hype about it and although it is a tad bit pricey, it is so worth it. They have such unique flavors im sad I didn&apos;t get to try them all but brambleberru crisp was my favorite. Will definitely be coming back again!"
