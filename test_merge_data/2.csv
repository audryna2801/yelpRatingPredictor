5,"On my 35th birthday I finally got to try The Purple Pig after all these years. Every time I&apos;ve gone in the past, I haven&apos;t had any luck because they usually don&apos;t take reservations and the wait was always so long; however, because of COVID-19, they are now taking reservations!

They definitely lived up to the hype after all these years and I was super happy with all the menu items we ordered. My favorite dish was the crispy pig ears with kale. It was like having elevated Chicharrón with crispy kale. The pickled banana peppers added the proper amount of acidity and the yolk from the fried egg soaked up all the flavors perfectly.

If you&apos;re looking for comfort food, the milk braise pork shoulder provided all of that. The gravy was mind blowing! Throw in some great cocktails and wine pairings and The Purple Pig is the perfect casual-chic restaurant for tourists and locals alike! You can&apos;t go wrong with any menu item here!"
5,"We came here to celebrate our anniversary. This place is known for long wait times and not allowing reservations. Not luckily, but luckily because of COVID, they are currently doing reservations. So we&apos;re able to walk in with our reservation and get a table right away. I will admit, this place was very casual and I felt like we were over dressed. They were very professional throughout the night and did really great explaining every dish and giving directions on how to eat the food so you can get the best taste out of each dish. Jimmy Bannos Jr. even stopped by our table to talk a little bit and made sure we were enjoying our night. 

We started off our night with a couple of drinks. My wife ordered their &quot;Paloma&quot; and I was feeling rich and magical that night and ordered their &quot;24 Carrot Magic.&quot; The Paloma was a simple classic made with Espolon blanco tequila, lime juice and grapefruit soda. It&apos;s really hard to get this one wrong. Definitely tasty. The 24 carrot Magic was something different. This one came with corazon reposado tequila, ancho Reyes Chile liqueur, carrot juice, lime juice and ginger syrup. A drink with a kick of heat, thanks to the ancho Reyes Chile liqueur. Never heard of such liqueur and is now on my list of things to buy! The carrot juice was overpower and made the drink taste healthy. I just wish they had the wider selection of drinks, the at least the drinks we both got were fantastic. 

We started off with their Crispy Pigs Ear and ended up with a total of four entries plus dessert. 

Crispy Pigs Ear-This seems to be a very popular dish. It&apos;s served with salty crispy pigs ear, mixed with kale, and pickled banana peppers and topped with a fried egg. You must break the yolk so it serves as a dressing to the pigs ear and mix it all together. If you just eat the pigs ear by itself, it will be too salty. The egg, kale and banana peppers helps balance all the flavors. Not sure if I&apos;d get this again though. 

Chicken thigh kebabs-You get two perfectly seasoned chicken kebabs on top of four fried smashed potatoes with Tzatziki sauce at the bottom. The chicken was very tender and went perfectly with their tasty tzatziki sauce. The potatoes we&apos;re good and worked as a starchy filler. The dish was tasty but $20 for two chicken kebabs was a tad bit much. Wouldn&apos;t mind ordering again, but would probably try some other plates next time. 

Whipped Feta- This dish was tasty. It came with toast and plenty of whipped feta to spread on the toast. The whipped feta came with cucumber and marinated tomatoes. The tomatoes were very tasty and tasted sweet. I would definitely order this dish again. 

Roasted Bone Marrow- This dish was my favorite dish of the night. It came with herbs, capers and onions with a side of Maldonado sea salt. You spread the bone marrow on the toast, grab some of the salt and sprinkle it on top, and then you top it off with the greens. A perfect bite every time. I would order this dish again and again. 

For dessert we opted for their popular &quot;Sicilian Iris.&quot; I will admit by dessert time, we were already stuffed, and whenever we&apos;re completely full we skip dessert. But since it was our anniversary and since it&apos;s the Purple Pig, we had to try a little bit of everything. The Sicilian iris, was tasty. It came warm and the fried ball was huge. It came stuffed ricotta, and chocolate chip. It reminded me of a warm gooey ball version of a cannoli. I wouldn&apos;t mind ordering this again. 

Overall, The Purple Pig hype is real. Everything was phenomenal. Flaw customer service, delicious food. Will definitely be returning."
5,"I had a great time at The Purple Pig. They recently opened the outdoor so I decided to give it a try. I was lucky to get a reservation spot on Tock. The reservation does require a $20 fee which will be applied to the check, but sometimes they might forget, so you want to check the final bill. The outdoor area was very small- maybe 5-6 tables, but it was fenced off and had its own trailer bathroom. 
We ordered the duck, pork shoulder, pork belly, broccoli and sweet corn. They were all really good.
The drinks were good as the portions were generous and there were a lot of alcohol in them- which is a plus!
All the meat dishes were very tender and the vegetable dishes were really nice too. It was one of the best broccoli dishes I have tried! The pork belly was a bit fatty, but it was soft and well cooked. The pork shoulder was meaty and the gravy, mashed potato and meat all went very well together.
The duck was massive, but still very soft and juicy. 
Some reviews mentioned that the portions are small but we had more than enough food and walked out very full.
I am not sure if this is worth the hype or the wait in the pre-covid period, but I thought the prices are relatively reasonable for the quality of food and there are many good options. Perhaps not the best in Chicago, but definitely the best in River North around Michigan Ave :)"
5,"Great place! 
Quite tasty and very affordable! Recently my friend and I went to this amazing restaurant. We ordered their best-seller food, and we were so pleased to find it wonderful! It was really tasty.  Both of us were pleased with the food and the operation. 
Thank you very much to all of you, guys!"
5,"We celebrated our anniversary in Chicago and one of our favorite spots was the Purple Pig. We were sad that it was just the two of us, because we wanted to order one of everything on the menu, but that would turn us into the purple pigs, so we went with a few favorites. The wait was minimal, and gave us a chance to sample some cheese and wine before we dined.

The dishes are rich and full of flavor, but we would have licked the plates if it wasn&apos;t rude to do in public-ha!

Some of our favorites were the Spanish octopus, pork jowl, pork liver pate, salt beets, and scallops. We kept seeing the turkey leg go by, but were so full, we couldn&apos;t make it work. Oh well, I guess we have to go back."
3,"Service was good. And food was okay. Their portions weren&apos;t very impressive &amp; the cost is quite high. I noticed they move their restaurant. I&apos;ve heard such great things about this restaurant and although food was good; it just wasn&apos;t THAT good. They have a $20 non refundable deposit to reserve a table. I assume it&apos;s cause of the pandemic and they don&apos;t want to hold a table for a no show. Everyone was socially distanced and staffs were wearing masks so it looks like they&apos;re honoring the safety guidelines. They also checked our temperature upon arrival. I definitely don&apos;t regret coming to try the food but don&apos;t think I&apos;ll go back just because the price is too high, portion size isn&apos;t too impressive, &amp; food was just average."
5,"My FAVORITE restaurant in all of Chicago hands down! The menu changes often but always features delicious, unique flavors. All the ingredients are so fresh and crafted together so perfectly. If on the menu- the broccoli, hot dog, and duck have been some of my all time favorites! You really can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu though. For the quality of food, it&apos;s very reasonably priced and worth every penny."
5,"I&apos;ve heard quite a bit about the Purple Pig,  but never found the time to go. This morning, we decided to go to their brunch. I am glad I did as it was one of the best brunches I have ever had in the city. 

I started out with a Paloma which was expertly made. We decided to go with the charcuterie board with sopressa and duck procuttio . Both are made in house. I thought the sopressa was excellent and the duck was ok. I think I&apos;ll go with another meat next time. The cheese was outstanding, but expected. The surprising Star was the bread....mmmmmmm. This board was the real deal. This seems like the thing to get with wine! 

My group shared three dishes: Chicken and Waffles, Avocado Toast, and French omelette. The omelette was expected, but excellent. A solid dish! The surprise was the Avocado Toast  which was a guacamole with the acid coming from the olives and cucumbers. It was a weird combo, but it worked! The chicken and waffles were the best I&apos;ve ever had! The waffle was more savory than sweet which I loved. The chicken was pretty epic too! 

Yes, this place is pretty pricey, but well worth the price! I knew it was good, but I never imagined it would be THAT good! One of the best brunches I&apos;ve had in Chicago, no question!"
5,"The milk braised pork shoulder is one of the best dishes I have had in Chicago. Bone marrow is also a must, the presentation was incredible and makes for a fun food-sharing experience. At least 3-4 dishes for two people."
5,A great place to stop by in Chicago. Try to reserve a table ahead of time to make sure you don&apos;t have to wait an hour or more. Definitely great service and good recommendations. Will definitely come back to try new things next time!
4,"Only came here for happy hour, but had a good experience.  My friends and I sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and attentive.  It was quiet when we arrived, but filled up after work (this was pre-COVID precautions).  Their happy hours specials were a good deal, and also tasted good.  The food menu looked good, so I would love to go back at some time to try a good meal (or at least happy hour with some appetizers)."
5,"Great menu, great service, unique food! A real treat! Will be back! This is an innovative, very creative menu."
4,"FOOD: Tapas with a heavy emphasis on MEAT. The COVID menu is a bit smaller than what I remembered from my last visit, but they had a great cheese/charcuterie selection (including a prosciutto duck!) and fan favorites pork shoulder and belly. The food is rich and full and the flavors are certainly not what you would expect from typical tapas 

SERVICE: Prompt service with great attitudes. No issues here

EXPERIENCE: The new location has multiple indoor seating options as well as a patio out back

VALUE: Deceiving large portion sizes. Between two people, we had two appetizers and two entrees and had enough for a full meals worth of left overs. Appetizers are about $10-15 and entrees $20-35

SUMMARY: Amazing meats and intriguing menu. This place is a classic and well worth the wait. Have come back multiple times and will continue to do so in the future"
5,"If you are looking for a good wine and tapas place in Chicago this is the way to go!! 

We came here on a Sunday morning around 11:30am and it wasn&apos;t too busy. The service was great and our server told us how it works here as it&apos;s mostly shared plates so about 5 plates was good for the 4 of us. 

We ordered:
crispy pig ears - these were way too salty for my taste but I liked the crunch
ricotta gnocchi-so cheesy and decadent but definitely heavy!
the bacon and liver pate-this was my absolute fav!!! It was so tasty
the pork belly-so tender and fatty with a really good sauce
The rib hash off the brunch menu-I loved that it came with an egg and the rib meat was tender.

Really good shared plates and they had a good selection of wine and cocktails!"
5,"Our company had a small corporate party (just around 8 people) and we&apos;ve decided to check out the Purple pig. And it was absolutely awesome decision as the food is very delicious, pork was crispy and tasty. They also have a good  wine menu. Everyone got satisfied of that evening.
And what is also important, the staff wear masks"
4,"I came here for dinner after a show during peak dinner hours and the wait was actually a lot shorter than I expected. I left my name and walked around and I got a notification about 15mins that my table was ready. The atmosphere is casual and loud. The seating was a bit tight and my table was very close to the tables beside me. 

FOOD:
In terms of food, I enjoyed most of the dishes I had. My favorites included the octopus and the bucatini. There was one dish that I didn&apos;t like which is the milk braised berkshire shoulder. The item seemed interesting so I decided to give it a try. The pork was tender but I didn&apos;t love the flavor profile of it. 

OVERALL:
I enjoyed most of the foods that I had and the service was great. I would highly recommend this restaurant."
5,"Not gonna lie, I&apos;m normally a non-believer in fancy cuisine, but my friend who was visiting wanted to come here, and now I can&apos;t wait to go back. We came early and enjoyed being the only guests for brunch. It&apos;s a beautiful restaurant with great service. All three dishes we tried, we liked."
5,Actually I changed my mind. Sometimes it takes time to learn what true greatness really is.
4,"TL;DR
What to order:
- Italian Feast - unfortunately it looks like they&apos;ve moved onto the &quot;Greek Feast&quot; :( - $18 per person + tax + tip

What to watch out for
- we specified 5:30 as the pickup time but they messaged us way earlier around 4pm to come pickup the food; when we got the food it was still somewhat warm but I don&apos;t understand why they didn&apos;t stick to the specified time...

=====

Ordered the Italian feast for 2 a couple weeks ago using Tock and it was really good! It comes with chicken cacciatore with potatoes; a salad with goat cheese, beets, and roasted asparagus; and a baked pasta with cheese and pork neckbone gravy. 

The highlights were definitely the chicken in the cacciatore, the asparagus in the salad, and the pasta was really good as a whole! The chicken fell off the bone and was extremely tender, the pasta was perfectly al dente, and everything in general was very flavorful. The portion sizes were fine and we spread out all the food across maybe two-ish meals each. They give you one salad box per person but everything else just comes in one container.

Some lowlights were that in the 2-person portion we got maybe 3 or so pieces of chicken and a lot of potato. The salad&apos;s dressing was also quite sweet, but as far as salads go, I mean, it was fine (I don&apos;t eat salads for the taste, I&apos;m afraid).

Overall I would love to try their other takeout options! ~$20 per person for the Purple Pig is a pretty darned good deal compared to their normal prices, and for the quality of food you get. Only docking a star for the pickup time snafu."
3,Perhaps they had an off night. Everything was... good... but modes not compare to places down south.

You must break the yolk so it serves as a dressing to the pigs ear and mix it all together. If you just eat the pigs ear by itself, it will be too salty. The egg, kale and banana peppers helps balance all the flavors. Not sure if I&apos;d get this again though. 

Chicken thigh kebabs-You get two perfectly seasoned chicken kebabs on top of four fried smashed potatoes with Tzatziki sauce at the bottom. The chicken was very tender and went perfectly with their tasty tzatziki sauce. The potatoes we&apos;re good and worked as a starchy filler. The dish was tasty but $20 for two chicken kebabs was a tad bit much. Wouldn&apos;t mind ordering again, but would probably try some other plates next time. 

Whipped Feta- This dish was tasty. It came with toast and plenty of whipped feta to spread on the toast. The whipped feta came with cucumber and marinated tomatoes. The tomatoes were very tasty and tasted sweet. I would definitely order this dish again. 

Roasted Bone Marrow- This dish was my favorite dish of the night. It came with herbs, capers and onions with a side of Maldonado sea salt. You spread the bone marrow on the toast, grab some of the salt and sprinkle it on top, and then you top it off with the greens. A perfect bite every time. I would order this dish again and again. 

For dessert we opted for their popular &quot;Sicilian Iris.&quot; I will admit by dessert time, we were already stuffed, and whenever we&apos;re completely full we skip dessert. But since it was our anniversary and since it&apos;s the Purple Pig, we had to try a little bit of everything. The Sicilian iris, was tasty. It came warm and the fried ball was huge. It came stuffed ricotta, and chocolate chip. It reminded me of a warm gooey ball version of a cannoli. I wouldn&apos;t mind ordering this again. 

Overall, The Purple Pig hype is real. Everything was phenomenal. Flaw customer service, delicious food. Will definitely be returning."
5,"I had a great time at The Purple Pig. They recently opened the outdoor so I decided to give it a try. I was lucky to get a reservation spot on Tock. The reservation does require a $20 fee which will be applied to the check, but sometimes they might forget, so you want to check the final bill. The outdoor area was very small- maybe 5-6 tables, but it was fenced off and had its own trailer bathroom. 
We ordered the duck, pork shoulder, pork belly, broccoli and sweet corn. They were all really good.
The drinks were good as the portions were generous and there were a lot of alcohol in them- which is a plus!
All the meat dishes were very tender and the vegetable dishes were really nice too. It was one of the best broccoli dishes I have tried! The pork belly was a bit fatty, but it was soft and well cooked. The pork shoulder was meaty and the gravy, mashed potato and meat all went very well together.
The duck was massive, but still very soft and juicy. 
Some reviews mentioned that the portions are small but we had more than enough food and walked out very full.
I am not sure if this is worth the hype or the wait in the pre-covid period, but I thought the prices are relatively reasonable for the quality of food and there are many good options. Perhaps not the best in Chicago, but definitely the best in River North around Michigan Ave :)"
5,"Great place! 
Quite tasty and very affordable! Recently my friend and I went to this amazing restaurant. We ordered their best-seller food, and we were so pleased to find it wonderful! It was really tasty.  Both of us were pleased with the food and the operation. 
Thank you very much to all of you, guys!"
5,"We celebrated our anniversary in Chicago and one of our favorite spots was the Purple Pig. We were sad that it was just the two of us, because we wanted to order one of everything on the menu, but that would turn us into the purple pigs, so we went with a few favorites. The wait was minimal, and gave us a chance to sample some cheese and wine before we dined.

The dishes are rich and full of flavor, but we would have licked the plates if it wasn&apos;t rude to do in public-ha!

Some of our favorites were the Spanish octopus, pork jowl, pork liver pate, salt beets, and scallops. We kept seeing the turkey leg go by, but were so full, we couldn&apos;t make it work. Oh well, I guess we have to go back."
3,"Service was good. And food was okay. Their portions weren&apos;t very impressive &amp; the cost is quite high. I noticed they move their restaurant. I&apos;ve heard such great things about this restaurant and although food was good; it just wasn&apos;t THAT good. They have a $20 non refundable deposit to reserve a table. I assume it&apos;s cause of the pandemic and they don&apos;t want to hold a table for a no show. Everyone was socially distanced and staffs were wearing masks so it looks like they&apos;re honoring the safety guidelines. They also checked our temperature upon arrival. I definitely don&apos;t regret coming to try the food but don&apos;t think I&apos;ll go back just because the price is too high, portion size isn&apos;t too impressive, &amp; food was just average."
5,"My FAVORITE restaurant in all of Chicago hands down! The menu changes often but always features delicious, unique flavors. All the ingredients are so fresh and crafted together so perfectly. If on the menu- the broccoli, hot dog, and duck have been some of my all time favorites! You really can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu though. For the quality of food, it&apos;s very reasonably priced and worth every penny."
5,"I&apos;ve heard quite a bit about the Purple Pig,  but never found the time to go. This morning, we decided to go to their brunch. I am glad I did as it was one of the best brunches I have ever had in the city. 

I started out with a Paloma which was expertly made. We decided to go with the charcuterie board with sopressa and duck procuttio . Both are made in house. I thought the sopressa was excellent and the duck was ok. I think I&apos;ll go with another meat next time. The cheese was outstanding, but expected. The surprising Star was the bread....mmmmmmm. This board was the real deal. This seems like the thing to get with wine! 

My group shared three dishes: Chicken and Waffles, Avocado Toast, and French omelette. The omelette was expected, but excellent. A solid dish! The surprise was the Avocado Toast  which was a guacamole with the acid coming from the olives and cucumbers. It was a weird combo, but it worked! The chicken and waffles were the best I&apos;ve ever had! The waffle was more savory than sweet which I loved. The chicken was pretty epic too! 

Yes, this place is pretty pricey, but well worth the price! I knew it was good, but I never imagined it would be THAT good! One of the best brunches I&apos;ve had in Chicago, no question!"
5,"The milk braised pork shoulder is one of the best dishes I have had in Chicago. Bone marrow is also a must, the presentation was incredible and makes for a fun food-sharing experience. At least 3-4 dishes for two people."
5,A great place to stop by in Chicago. Try to reserve a table ahead of time to make sure you don&apos;t have to wait an hour or more. Definitely great service and good recommendations. Will definitely come back to try new things next time!
4,"Only came here for happy hour, but had a good experience.  My friends and I sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and attentive.  It was quiet when we arrived, but filled up after work (this was pre-COVID precautions).  Their happy hours specials were a good deal, and also tasted good.  The food menu looked good, so I would love to go back at some time to try a good meal (or at least happy hour with some appetizers)."
5,"Great menu, great service, unique food! A real treat! Will be back! This is an innovative, very creative menu."
4,"FOOD: Tapas with a heavy emphasis on MEAT. The COVID menu is a bit smaller than what I remembered from my last visit, but they had a great cheese/charcuterie selection (including a prosciutto duck!) and fan favorites pork shoulder and belly. The food is rich and full and the flavors are certainly not what you would expect from typical tapas 

SERVICE: Prompt service with great attitudes. No issues here

EXPERIENCE: The new location has multiple indoor seating options as well as a patio out back

VALUE: Deceiving large portion sizes. Between two people, we had two appetizers and two entrees and had enough for a full meals worth of left overs. Appetizers are about $10-15 and entrees $20-35

SUMMARY: Amazing meats and intriguing menu. This place is a classic and well worth the wait. Have come back multiple times and will continue to do so in the future"
5,"If you are looking for a good wine and tapas place in Chicago this is the way to go!! 

We came here on a Sunday morning around 11:30am and it wasn&apos;t too busy. The service was great and our server told us how it works here as it&apos;s mostly shared plates so about 5 plates was good for the 4 of us. 

We ordered:
crispy pig ears - these were way too salty for my taste but I liked the crunch
ricotta gnocchi-so cheesy and decadent but definitely heavy!
the bacon and liver pate-this was my absolute fav!!! It was so tasty
the pork belly-so tender and fatty with a really good sauce
The rib hash off the brunch menu-I loved that it came with an egg and the rib meat was tender.

Really good shared plates and they had a good selection of wine and cocktails!"
5,"Our company had a small corporate party (just around 8 people) and we&apos;ve decided to check out the Purple pig. And it was absolutely awesome decision as the food is very delicious, pork was crispy and tasty. They also have a good  wine menu. Everyone got satisfied of that evening.
And what is also important, the staff wear masks"
4,"I came here for dinner after a show during peak dinner hours and the wait was actually a lot shorter than I expected. I left my name and walked around and I got a notification about 15mins that my table was ready. The atmosphere is casual and loud. The seating was a bit tight and my table was very close to the tables beside me. 

FOOD:
In terms of food, I enjoyed most of the dishes I had. My favorites included the octopus and the bucatini. There was one dish that I didn&apos;t like which is the milk braised berkshire shoulder. The item seemed interesting so I decided to give it a try. The pork was tender but I didn&apos;t love the flavor profile of it. 

OVERALL:
I enjoyed most of the foods that I had and the service was great. I would highly recommend this restaurant."
5,"Not gonna lie, I&apos;m normally a non-believer in fancy cuisine, but my friend who was visiting wanted to come here, and now I can&apos;t wait to go back. We came early and enjoyed being the only guests for brunch. It&apos;s a beautiful restaurant with great service. All three dishes we tried, we liked."
5,Actually I changed my mind. Sometimes it takes time to learn what true greatness really is.
4,"TL;DR
What to order:
- Italian Feast - unfortunately it looks like they&apos;ve moved onto the &quot;Greek Feast&quot; :( - $18 per person + tax + tip

What to watch out for
- we specified 5:30 as the pickup time but they messaged us way earlier around 4pm to come pickup the food; when we got the food it was still somewhat warm but I don&apos;t understand why they didn&apos;t stick to the specified time...

=====

Ordered the Italian feast for 2 a couple weeks ago using Tock and it was really good! It comes with chicken cacciatore with potatoes; a salad with goat cheese, beets, and roasted asparagus; and a baked pasta with cheese and pork neckbone gravy. 

The highlights were definitely the chicken in the cacciatore, the asparagus in the salad, and the pasta was really good as a whole! The chicken fell off the bone and was extremely tender, the pasta was perfectly al dente, and everything in general was very flavorful. The portion sizes were fine and we spread out all the food across maybe two-ish meals each. They give you one salad box per person but everything else just comes in one container.

Some lowlights were that in the 2-person portion we got maybe 3 or so pieces of chicken and a lot of potato. The salad&apos;s dressing was also quite sweet, but as far as salads go, I mean, it was fine (I don&apos;t eat salads for the taste, I&apos;m afraid).

Overall I would love to try their other takeout options! ~$20 per person for the Purple Pig is a pretty darned good deal compared to their normal prices, and for the quality of food you get. Only docking a star for the pickup time snafu."
3,Perhaps they had an off night. Everything was... good... but modes not compare to places down south.
5,"On my 35th birthday I finally got to try The Purple Pig after all these years. Every time I&apos;ve gone in the past, I haven&apos;t had any luck because they usually don&apos;t take reservations and the wait was always so long; however, because of COVID-19, they are now taking reservations!

They definitely lived up to the hype after all these years and I was super happy with all the menu items we ordered. My favorite dish was the crispy pig ears with kale. It was like having elevated Chicharrón with crispy kale. The pickled banana peppers added the proper amount of acidity and the yolk from the fried egg soaked up all the flavors perfectly.

If you&apos;re looking for comfort food, the milk braise pork shoulder provided all of that. The gravy was mind blowing! Throw in some great cocktails and wine pairings and The Purple Pig is the perfect casual-chic restaurant for tourists and locals alike! You can&apos;t go wrong with any menu item here!"
5,"We came here to celebrate our anniversary. This place is known for long wait times and not allowing reservations. Not luckily, but luckily because of COVID, they are currently doing reservations. So we&apos;re able to walk in with our reservation and get a table right away. I will admit, this place was very casual and I felt like we were over dressed. They were very professional throughout the night and did really great explaining every dish and giving directions on how to eat the food so you can get the best taste out of each dish. Jimmy Bannos Jr. even stopped by our table to talk a little bit and made sure we were enjoying our night. 

We started off our night with a couple of drinks. My wife ordered their &quot;Paloma&quot; and I was feeling rich and magical that night and ordered their &quot;24 Carrot Magic.&quot; The Paloma was a simple classic made with Espolon blanco tequila, lime juice and grapefruit soda. It&apos;s really hard to get this one wrong. Definitely tasty. The 24 carrot Magic was something different. This one came with corazon reposado tequila, ancho Reyes Chile liqueur, carrot juice, lime juice and ginger syrup. A drink with a kick of heat, thanks to the ancho Reyes Chile liqueur. Never heard of such liqueur and is now on my list of things to buy! The carrot juice was overpower and made the drink taste healthy. I just wish they had the wider selection of drinks, the at least the drinks we both got were fantastic. 

We started off with their Crispy Pigs Ear and ended up with a total of four entries plus dessert. 

Crispy Pigs Ear-This seems to be a very popular dish. It&apos;s served with salty crispy pigs ear, mixed with kale, and pickled banana peppers and topped with a fried egg.

We ordered the duck, pork shoulder, pork belly, broccoli and sweet corn. They were all really good.
The drinks were good as the portions were generous and there were a lot of alcohol in them- which is a plus!
All the meat dishes were very tender and the vegetable dishes were really nice too. It was one of the best broccoli dishes I have tried! The pork belly was a bit fatty, but it was soft and well cooked. The pork shoulder was meaty and the gravy, mashed potato and meat all went very well together.
The duck was massive, but still very soft and juicy. 
Some reviews mentioned that the portions are small but we had more than enough food and walked out very full.
I am not sure if this is worth the hype or the wait in the pre-covid period, but I thought the prices are relatively reasonable for the quality of food and there are many good options. Perhaps not the best in Chicago, but definitely the best in River North around Michigan Ave :)"
5,"Great place! 
Quite tasty and very affordable! Recently my friend and I went to this amazing restaurant. We ordered their best-seller food, and we were so pleased to find it wonderful! It was really tasty.  Both of us were pleased with the food and the operation. 
Thank you very much to all of you, guys!"
5,"We celebrated our anniversary in Chicago and one of our favorite spots was the Purple Pig. We were sad that it was just the two of us, because we wanted to order one of everything on the menu, but that would turn us into the purple pigs, so we went with a few favorites. The wait was minimal, and gave us a chance to sample some cheese and wine before we dined.

The dishes are rich and full of flavor, but we would have licked the plates if it wasn&apos;t rude to do in public-ha!

Some of our favorites were the Spanish octopus, pork jowl, pork liver pate, salt beets, and scallops. We kept seeing the turkey leg go by, but were so full, we couldn&apos;t make it work. Oh well, I guess we have to go back."
3,"Service was good. And food was okay. Their portions weren&apos;t very impressive &amp; the cost is quite high. I noticed they move their restaurant. I&apos;ve heard such great things about this restaurant and although food was good; it just wasn&apos;t THAT good. They have a $20 non refundable deposit to reserve a table. I assume it&apos;s cause of the pandemic and they don&apos;t want to hold a table for a no show. Everyone was socially distanced and staffs were wearing masks so it looks like they&apos;re honoring the safety guidelines. They also checked our temperature upon arrival. I definitely don&apos;t regret coming to try the food but don&apos;t think I&apos;ll go back just because the price is too high, portion size isn&apos;t too impressive, &amp; food was just average."
5,"My FAVORITE restaurant in all of Chicago hands down! The menu changes often but always features delicious, unique flavors. All the ingredients are so fresh and crafted together so perfectly. If on the menu- the broccoli, hot dog, and duck have been some of my all time favorites! You really can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu though. For the quality of food, it&apos;s very reasonably priced and worth every penny."
5,"I&apos;ve heard quite a bit about the Purple Pig,  but never found the time to go. This morning, we decided to go to their brunch. I am glad I did as it was one of the best brunches I have ever had in the city. 

I started out with a Paloma which was expertly made. We decided to go with the charcuterie board with sopressa and duck procuttio . Both are made in house. I thought the sopressa was excellent and the duck was ok. I think I&apos;ll go with another meat next time. The cheese was outstanding, but expected. The surprising Star was the bread....mmmmmmm. This board was the real deal. This seems like the thing to get with wine! 

My group shared three dishes: Chicken and Waffles, Avocado Toast, and French omelette. The omelette was expected, but excellent. A solid dish! The surprise was the Avocado Toast  which was a guacamole with the acid coming from the olives and cucumbers. It was a weird combo, but it worked! The chicken and waffles were the best I&apos;ve ever had! The waffle was more savory than sweet which I loved. The chicken was pretty epic too! 

Yes, this place is pretty pricey, but well worth the price! I knew it was good, but I never imagined it would be THAT good! One of the best brunches I&apos;ve had in Chicago, no question!"
5,"The milk braised pork shoulder is one of the best dishes I have had in Chicago. Bone marrow is also a must, the presentation was incredible and makes for a fun food-sharing experience. At least 3-4 dishes for two people."
5,A great place to stop by in Chicago. Try to reserve a table ahead of time to make sure you don&apos;t have to wait an hour or more. Definitely great service and good recommendations. Will definitely come back to try new things next time!
4,"Only came here for happy hour, but had a good experience.  My friends and I sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and attentive.  It was quiet when we arrived, but filled up after work (this was pre-COVID precautions).  Their happy hours specials were a good deal, and also tasted good.  The food menu looked good, so I would love to go back at some time to try a good meal (or at least happy hour with some appetizers)."
5,"Great menu, great service, unique food! A real treat! Will be back! This is an innovative, very creative menu."
4,"FOOD: Tapas with a heavy emphasis on MEAT. The COVID menu is a bit smaller than what I remembered from my last visit, but they had a great cheese/charcuterie selection (including a prosciutto duck!) and fan favorites pork shoulder and belly. The food is rich and full and the flavors are certainly not what you would expect from typical tapas 

SERVICE: Prompt service with great attitudes. No issues here

EXPERIENCE: The new location has multiple indoor seating options as well as a patio out back

VALUE: Deceiving large portion sizes. Between two people, we had two appetizers and two entrees and had enough for a full meals worth of left overs. Appetizers are about $10-15 and entrees $20-35

SUMMARY: Amazing meats and intriguing menu. This place is a classic and well worth the wait. Have come back multiple times and will continue to do so in the future"
5,"If you are looking for a good wine and tapas place in Chicago this is the way to go!! 

We came here on a Sunday morning around 11:30am and it wasn&apos;t too busy. The service was great and our server told us how it works here as it&apos;s mostly shared plates so about 5 plates was good for the 4 of us. 

We ordered:
crispy pig ears - these were way too salty for my taste but I liked the crunch
ricotta gnocchi-so cheesy and decadent but definitely heavy!
the bacon and liver pate-this was my absolute fav!!! It was so tasty
the pork belly-so tender and fatty with a really good sauce
The rib hash off the brunch menu-I loved that it came with an egg and the rib meat was tender.

Really good shared plates and they had a good selection of wine and cocktails!"
5,"Our company had a small corporate party (just around 8 people) and we&apos;ve decided to check out the Purple pig. And it was absolutely awesome decision as the food is very delicious, pork was crispy and tasty. They also have a good  wine menu. Everyone got satisfied of that evening.
And what is also important, the staff wear masks"
4,"I came here for dinner after a show during peak dinner hours and the wait was actually a lot shorter than I expected. I left my name and walked around and I got a notification about 15mins that my table was ready. The atmosphere is casual and loud. The seating was a bit tight and my table was very close to the tables beside me. 

FOOD:
In terms of food, I enjoyed most of the dishes I had. My favorites included the octopus and the bucatini. There was one dish that I didn&apos;t like which is the milk braised berkshire shoulder. The item seemed interesting so I decided to give it a try. The pork was tender but I didn&apos;t love the flavor profile of it. 

OVERALL:
I enjoyed most of the foods that I had and the service was great. I would highly recommend this restaurant."
5,"Not gonna lie, I&apos;m normally a non-believer in fancy cuisine, but my friend who was visiting wanted to come here, and now I can&apos;t wait to go back. We came early and enjoyed being the only guests for brunch. It&apos;s a beautiful restaurant with great service. All three dishes we tried, we liked."
5,Actually I changed my mind. Sometimes it takes time to learn what true greatness really is.
4,"TL;DR
What to order:
- Italian Feast - unfortunately it looks like they&apos;ve moved onto the &quot;Greek Feast&quot; :( - $18 per person + tax + tip

What to watch out for
- we specified 5:30 as the pickup time but they messaged us way earlier around 4pm to come pickup the food; when we got the food it was still somewhat warm but I don&apos;t understand why they didn&apos;t stick to the specified time...

=====

Ordered the Italian feast for 2 a couple weeks ago using Tock and it was really good! It comes with chicken cacciatore with potatoes; a salad with goat cheese, beets, and roasted asparagus; and a baked pasta with cheese and pork neckbone gravy. 

The highlights were definitely the chicken in the cacciatore, the asparagus in the salad, and the pasta was really good as a whole! The chicken fell off the bone and was extremely tender, the pasta was perfectly al dente, and everything in general was very flavorful. The portion sizes were fine and we spread out all the food across maybe two-ish meals each. They give you one salad box per person but everything else just comes in one container.

Some lowlights were that in the 2-person portion we got maybe 3 or so pieces of chicken and a lot of potato. The salad&apos;s dressing was also quite sweet, but as far as salads go, I mean, it was fine (I don&apos;t eat salads for the taste, I&apos;m afraid).

Overall I would love to try their other takeout options! ~$20 per person for the Purple Pig is a pretty darned good deal compared to their normal prices, and for the quality of food you get. Only docking a star for the pickup time snafu."
3,Perhaps they had an off night. Everything was... good... but modes not compare to places down south.
5,"On my 35th birthday I finally got to try The Purple Pig after all these years. Every time I&apos;ve gone in the past, I haven&apos;t had any luck because they usually don&apos;t take reservations and the wait was always so long; however, because of COVID-19, they are now taking reservations!

They definitely lived up to the hype after all these years and I was super happy with all the menu items we ordered. My favorite dish was the crispy pig ears with kale. It was like having elevated Chicharrón with crispy kale. The pickled banana peppers added the proper amount of acidity and the yolk from the fried egg soaked up all the flavors perfectly.

If you&apos;re looking for comfort food, the milk braise pork shoulder provided all of that. The gravy was mind blowing! Throw in some great cocktails and wine pairings and The Purple Pig is the perfect casual-chic restaurant for tourists and locals alike! You can&apos;t go wrong with any menu item here!"
5,"We came here to celebrate our anniversary. This place is known for long wait times and not allowing reservations. Not luckily, but luckily because of COVID, they are currently doing reservations. So we&apos;re able to walk in with our reservation and get a table right away. I will admit, this place was very casual and I felt like we were over dressed. They were very professional throughout the night and did really great explaining every dish and giving directions on how to eat the food so you can get the best taste out of each dish. Jimmy Bannos Jr. even stopped by our table to talk a little bit and made sure we were enjoying our night. 

We started off our night with a couple of drinks. My wife ordered their &quot;Paloma&quot; and I was feeling rich and magical that night and ordered their &quot;24 Carrot Magic.&quot; The Paloma was a simple classic made with Espolon blanco tequila, lime juice and grapefruit soda. It&apos;s really hard to get this one wrong. Definitely tasty. The 24 carrot Magic was something different. This one came with corazon reposado tequila, ancho Reyes Chile liqueur, carrot juice, lime juice and ginger syrup. A drink with a kick of heat, thanks to the ancho Reyes Chile liqueur. Never heard of such liqueur and is now on my list of things to buy! The carrot juice was overpower and made the drink taste healthy. I just wish they had the wider selection of drinks, the at least the drinks we both got were fantastic. 

We started off with their Crispy Pigs Ear and ended up with a total of four entries plus dessert. 

Crispy Pigs Ear-This seems to be a very popular dish. It&apos;s served with salty crispy pigs ear, mixed with kale, and pickled banana peppers and topped with a fried egg. You must break the yolk so it serves as a dressing to the pigs ear and mix it all together. If you just eat the pigs ear by itself, it will be too salty. The egg, kale and banana peppers helps balance all the flavors. Not sure if I&apos;d get this again though. 

Chicken thigh kebabs-You get two perfectly seasoned chicken kebabs on top of four fried smashed potatoes with Tzatziki sauce at the bottom. The chicken was very tender and went perfectly with their tasty tzatziki sauce. The potatoes we&apos;re good and worked as a starchy filler. The dish was tasty but $20 for two chicken kebabs was a tad bit much. Wouldn&apos;t mind ordering again, but would probably try some other plates next time. 

Whipped Feta- This dish was tasty. It came with toast and plenty of whipped feta to spread on the toast. The whipped feta came with cucumber and marinated tomatoes. The tomatoes were very tasty and tasted sweet. I would definitely order this dish again. 

Roasted Bone Marrow- This dish was my favorite dish of the night. It came with herbs, capers and onions with a side of Maldonado sea salt. You spread the bone marrow on the toast, grab some of the salt and sprinkle it on top, and then you top it off with the greens. A perfect bite every time. I would order this dish again and again. 

For dessert we opted for their popular &quot;Sicilian Iris.&quot; I will admit by dessert time, we were already stuffed, and whenever we&apos;re completely full we skip dessert. But since it was our anniversary and since it&apos;s the Purple Pig, we had to try a little bit of everything. The Sicilian iris, was tasty. It came warm and the fried ball was huge. It came stuffed ricotta, and chocolate chip. It reminded me of a warm gooey ball version of a cannoli. I wouldn&apos;t mind ordering this again. 

Overall, The Purple Pig hype is real. Everything was phenomenal. Flaw customer service, delicious food. Will definitely be returning."
5,"I had a great time at The Purple Pig. They recently opened the outdoor so I decided to give it a try. I was lucky to get a reservation spot on Tock.

The outdoor area was very small- maybe 5-6 tables, but it was fenced off and had its own trailer bathroom.

I assume it&apos;s cause of the pandemic and they don&apos;t want to hold a table for a no show. Everyone was socially distanced and staffs were wearing masks so it looks like they&apos;re honoring the safety guidelines. They also checked our temperature upon arrival. I definitely don&apos;t regret coming to try the food but don&apos;t think I&apos;ll go back just because the price is too high, portion size isn&apos;t too impressive, &amp; food was just average."
5,"My FAVORITE restaurant in all of Chicago hands down! The menu changes often but always features delicious, unique flavors. All the ingredients are so fresh and crafted together so perfectly. If on the menu- the broccoli, hot dog, and duck have been some of my all time favorites! You really can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu though. For the quality of food, it&apos;s very reasonably priced and worth every penny."
5,"I&apos;ve heard quite a bit about the Purple Pig,  but never found the time to go. This morning, we decided to go to their brunch. I am glad I did as it was one of the best brunches I have ever had in the city. 

I started out with a Paloma which was expertly made. We decided to go with the charcuterie board with sopressa and duck procuttio . Both are made in house. I thought the sopressa was excellent and the duck was ok. I think I&apos;ll go with another meat next time. The cheese was outstanding, but expected. The surprising Star was the bread....mmmmmmm. This board was the real deal. This seems like the thing to get with wine! 

My group shared three dishes: Chicken and Waffles, Avocado Toast, and French omelette. The omelette was expected, but excellent. A solid dish! The surprise was the Avocado Toast  which was a guacamole with the acid coming from the olives and cucumbers. It was a weird combo, but it worked! The chicken and waffles were the best I&apos;ve ever had! The waffle was more savory than sweet which I loved. The chicken was pretty epic too! 

Yes, this place is pretty pricey, but well worth the price! I knew it was good, but I never imagined it would be THAT good! One of the best brunches I&apos;ve had in Chicago, no question!"
5,"The milk braised pork shoulder is one of the best dishes I have had in Chicago. Bone marrow is also a must, the presentation was incredible and makes for a fun food-sharing experience. At least 3-4 dishes for two people."
5,A great place to stop by in Chicago. Try to reserve a table ahead of time to make sure you don&apos;t have to wait an hour or more. Definitely great service and good recommendations. Will definitely come back to try new things next time!
4,"Only came here for happy hour, but had a good experience.  My friends and I sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and attentive.  It was quiet when we arrived, but filled up after work (this was pre-COVID precautions).  Their happy hours specials were a good deal, and also tasted good.  The food menu looked good, so I would love to go back at some time to try a good meal (or at least happy hour with some appetizers)."
5,"Great menu, great service, unique food! A real treat! Will be back! This is an innovative, very creative menu."
4,"FOOD: Tapas with a heavy emphasis on MEAT. The COVID menu is a bit smaller than what I remembered from my last visit, but they had a great cheese/charcuterie selection (including a prosciutto duck!) and fan favorites pork shoulder and belly. The food is rich and full and the flavors are certainly not what you would expect from typical tapas 

SERVICE: Prompt service with great attitudes. No issues here

EXPERIENCE: The new location has multiple indoor seating options as well as a patio out back

VALUE: Deceiving large portion sizes. Between two people, we had two appetizers and two entrees and had enough for a full meals worth of left overs. Appetizers are about $10-15 and entrees $20-35

SUMMARY: Amazing meats and intriguing menu. This place is a classic and well worth the wait. Have come back multiple times and will continue to do so in the future"
5,"If you are looking for a good wine and tapas place in Chicago this is the way to go!! 

We came here on a Sunday morning around 11:30am and it wasn&apos;t too busy. The service was great and our server told us how it works here as it&apos;s mostly shared plates so about 5 plates was good for the 4 of us. 

We ordered:
crispy pig ears - these were way too salty for my taste but I liked the crunch
ricotta gnocchi-so cheesy and decadent but definitely heavy!
the bacon and liver pate-this was my absolute fav!!! It was so tasty
the pork belly-so tender and fatty with a really good sauce
The rib hash off the brunch menu-I loved that it came with an egg and the rib meat was tender.

Really good shared plates and they had a good selection of wine and cocktails!"
5,"Our company had a small corporate party (just around 8 people) and we&apos;ve decided to check out the Purple pig. And it was absolutely awesome decision as the food is very delicious, pork was crispy and tasty. They also have a good  wine menu. Everyone got satisfied of that evening.
And what is also important, the staff wear masks"
4,"I came here for dinner after a show during peak dinner hours and the wait was actually a lot shorter than I expected. I left my name and walked around and I got a notification about 15mins that my table was ready. The atmosphere is casual and loud. The seating was a bit tight and my table was very close to the tables beside me. 

FOOD:
In terms of food, I enjoyed most of the dishes I had. My favorites included the octopus and the bucatini. There was one dish that I didn&apos;t like which is the milk braised berkshire shoulder. The item seemed interesting so I decided to give it a try. The pork was tender but I didn&apos;t love the flavor profile of it. 

OVERALL:
I enjoyed most of the foods that I had and the service was great. I would highly recommend this restaurant."
5,"Not gonna lie, I&apos;m normally a non-believer in fancy cuisine, but my friend who was visiting wanted to come here, and now I can&apos;t wait to go back. We came early and enjoyed being the only guests for brunch. It&apos;s a beautiful restaurant with great service. All three dishes we tried, we liked."
5,Actually I changed my mind. Sometimes it takes time to learn what true greatness really is.
4,"TL;DR
What to order:
- Italian Feast - unfortunately it looks like they&apos;ve moved onto the &quot;Greek Feast&quot; :( - $18 per person + tax + tip

What to watch out for
- we specified 5:30 as the pickup time but they messaged us way earlier around 4pm to come pickup the food; when we got the food it was still somewhat warm but I don&apos;t understand why they didn&apos;t stick to the specified time...

=====

Ordered the Italian feast for 2 a couple weeks ago using Tock and it was really good! It comes with chicken cacciatore with potatoes; a salad with goat cheese, beets, and roasted asparagus; and a baked pasta with cheese and pork neckbone gravy. 

The highlights were definitely the chicken in the cacciatore, the asparagus in the salad, and the pasta was really good as a whole! The chicken fell off the bone and was extremely tender, the pasta was perfectly al dente, and everything in general was very flavorful. The portion sizes were fine and we spread out all the food across maybe two-ish meals each. They give you one salad box per person but everything else just comes in one container.

Some lowlights were that in the 2-person portion we got maybe 3 or so pieces of chicken and a lot of potato. The salad&apos;s dressing was also quite sweet, but as far as salads go, I mean, it was fine (I don&apos;t eat salads for the taste, I&apos;m afraid).

Overall I would love to try their other takeout options! ~$20 per person for the Purple Pig is a pretty darned good deal compared to their normal prices, and for the quality of food you get. Only docking a star for the pickup time snafu."
3,Perhaps they had an off night. Everything was... good... but modes not compare to places down south.
5,"On my 35th birthday I finally got to try The Purple Pig after all these years. Every time I&apos;ve gone in the past, I haven&apos;t had any luck because they usually don&apos;t take reservations and the wait was always so long; however, because of COVID-19, they are now taking reservations!

They definitely lived up to the hype after all these years and I was super happy with all the menu items we ordered. My favorite dish was the crispy pig ears with kale. It was like having elevated Chicharrón with crispy kale. The pickled banana peppers added the proper amount of acidity and the yolk from the fried egg soaked up all the flavors perfectly.

If you&apos;re looking for comfort food, the milk braise pork shoulder provided all of that. The gravy was mind blowing! Throw in some great cocktails and wine pairings and The Purple Pig is the perfect casual-chic restaurant for tourists and locals alike! You can&apos;t go wrong with any menu item here!"
5,"We came here to celebrate our anniversary. This place is known for long wait times and not allowing reservations. Not luckily, but luckily because of COVID, they are currently doing reservations. So we&apos;re able to walk in with our reservation and get a table right away. I will admit, this place was very casual and I felt like we were over dressed. They were very professional throughout the night and did really great explaining every dish and giving directions on how to eat the food so you can get the best taste out of each dish. Jimmy Bannos Jr. even stopped by our table to talk a little bit and made sure we were enjoying our night. 

We started off our night with a couple of drinks. My wife ordered their &quot;Paloma&quot; and I was feeling rich and magical that night and ordered their &quot;24 Carrot Magic.&quot; The Paloma was a simple classic made with Espolon blanco tequila, lime juice and grapefruit soda. It&apos;s really hard to get this one wrong. Definitely tasty. The 24 carrot Magic was something different. This one came with corazon reposado tequila, ancho Reyes Chile liqueur, carrot juice, lime juice and ginger syrup. A drink with a kick of heat, thanks to the ancho Reyes Chile liqueur. Never heard of such liqueur and is now on my list of things to buy! The carrot juice was overpower and made the drink taste healthy. I just wish they had the wider selection of drinks, the at least the drinks we both got were fantastic. 

We started off with their Crispy Pigs Ear and ended up with a total of four entries plus dessert. 

Crispy Pigs Ear-This seems to be a very popular dish. It&apos;s served with salty crispy pigs ear, mixed with kale, and pickled banana peppers and topped with a fried egg. You must break the yolk so it serves as a dressing to the pigs ear and mix it all together. If you just eat the pigs ear by itself, it will be too salty. The egg, kale and banana peppers helps balance all the flavors. Not sure if I&apos;d get this again though. 

Chicken thigh kebabs-You get two perfectly seasoned chicken kebabs on top of four fried smashed potatoes with Tzatziki sauce at the bottom. The chicken was very tender and went perfectly with their tasty tzatziki sauce. The potatoes we&apos;re good and worked as a starchy filler. The dish was tasty but $20 for two chicken kebabs was a tad bit much. Wouldn&apos;t mind ordering again, but would probably try some other plates next time. 

Whipped Feta- This dish was tasty. It came with toast and plenty of whipped feta to spread on the toast. The whipped feta came with cucumber and marinated tomatoes. The tomatoes were very tasty and tasted sweet. I would definitely order this dish again. 

Roasted Bone Marrow- This dish was my favorite dish of the night. It came with herbs, capers and onions with a side of Maldonado sea salt. You spread the bone marrow on the toast, grab some of the salt and sprinkle it on top, and then you top it off with the greens. A perfect bite every time. I would order this dish again and again. 

For dessert we opted for their popular &quot;Sicilian Iris.&quot; I will admit by dessert time, we were already stuffed, and whenever we&apos;re completely full we skip dessert. But since it was our anniversary and since it&apos;s the Purple Pig, we had to try a little bit of everything. The Sicilian iris, was tasty. It came warm and the fried ball was huge. It came stuffed ricotta, and chocolate chip. It reminded me of a warm gooey ball version of a cannoli. I wouldn&apos;t mind ordering this again. 

Overall, The Purple Pig hype is real. Everything was phenomenal. Flaw customer service, delicious food. Will definitely be returning."
5,"I had a great time at The Purple Pig. They recently opened the outdoor so I decided to give it a try. I was lucky to get a reservation spot on Tock. The reservation does require a $20 fee which will be applied to the check, but sometimes they might forget, so you want to check the final bill. The outdoor area was very small- maybe 5-6 tables, but it was fenced off and had its own trailer bathroom. 
We ordered the duck, pork shoulder, pork belly, broccoli and sweet corn. They were all really good.
The drinks were good as the portions were generous and there were a lot of alcohol in them- which is a plus!
All the meat dishes were very tender and the vegetable dishes were really nice too. It was one of the best broccoli dishes I have tried! The pork belly was a bit fatty, but it was soft and well cooked. The pork shoulder was meaty and the gravy, mashed potato and meat all went very well together.
The duck was massive, but still very soft and juicy. 
Some reviews mentioned that the portions are small but we had more than enough food and walked out very full.
I am not sure if this is worth the hype or the wait in the pre-covid period, but I thought the prices are relatively reasonable for the quality of food and there are many good options. Perhaps not the best in Chicago, but definitely the best in River North around Michigan Ave :)"
5,"Great place! 
Quite tasty and very affordable! Recently my friend and I went to this amazing restaurant. We ordered their best-seller food, and we were so pleased to find it wonderful! It was really tasty.  Both of us were pleased with the food and the operation. 
Thank you very much to all of you, guys!"
5,"We celebrated our anniversary in Chicago and one of our favorite spots was the Purple Pig. We were sad that it was just the two of us, because we wanted to order one of everything on the menu, but that would turn us into the purple pigs, so we went with a few favorites. The wait was minimal, and gave us a chance to sample some cheese and wine before we dined.

The dishes are rich and full of flavor, but we would have licked the plates if it wasn&apos;t rude to do in public-ha!

Some of our favorites were the Spanish octopus, pork jowl, pork liver pate, salt beets, and scallops. We kept seeing the turkey leg go by, but were so full, we couldn&apos;t make it work. Oh well, I guess we have to go back."

5,"The milk braised pork shoulder is one of the best dishes I have had in Chicago. Bone marrow is also a must, the presentation was incredible and makes for a fun food-sharing experience. At least 3-4 dishes for two people."
5,A great place to stop by in Chicago. Try to reserve a table ahead of time to make sure you don&apos;t have to wait an hour or more. Definitely great service and good recommendations. Will definitely come back to try new things next time!
4,"Only came here for happy hour, but had a good experience.  My friends and I sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and attentive.  It was quiet when we arrived, but filled up after work (this was pre-COVID precautions).  Their happy hours specials were a good deal, and also tasted good.  The food menu looked good, so I would love to go back at some time to try a good meal (or at least happy hour with some appetizers)."
5,"Great menu, great service, unique food! A real treat! Will be back! This is an innovative, very creative menu."
4,"FOOD: Tapas with a heavy emphasis on MEAT. The COVID menu is a bit smaller than what I remembered from my last visit, but they had a great cheese/charcuterie selection (including a prosciutto duck!) and fan favorites pork shoulder and belly. The food is rich and full and the flavors are certainly not what you would expect from typical tapas 

SERVICE: Prompt service with great attitudes. No issues here

EXPERIENCE: The new location has multiple indoor seating options as well as a patio out back

VALUE: Deceiving large portion sizes. Between two people, we had two appetizers and two entrees and had enough for a full meals worth of left overs. Appetizers are about $10-15 and entrees $20-35

SUMMARY: Amazing meats and intriguing menu. This place is a classic and well worth the wait. Have come back multiple times and will continue to do so in the future"
5,"If you are looking for a good wine and tapas place in Chicago this is the way to go!! 

We came here on a Sunday morning around 11:30am and it wasn&apos;t too busy. The service was great and our server told us how it works here as it&apos;s mostly shared plates so about 5 plates was good for the 4 of us. 

We ordered:
crispy pig ears - these were way too salty for my taste but I liked the crunch
ricotta gnocchi-so cheesy and decadent but definitely heavy!
the bacon and liver pate-this was my absolute fav!!! It was so tasty
the pork belly-so tender and fatty with a really good sauce
The rib hash off the brunch menu-I loved that it came with an egg and the rib meat was tender.

Really good shared plates and they had a good selection of wine and cocktails!"
5,"Our company had a small corporate party (just around 8 people) and we&apos;ve decided to check out the Purple pig. And it was absolutely awesome decision as the food is very delicious, pork was crispy and tasty. They also have a good  wine menu. Everyone got satisfied of that evening.
And what is also important, the staff wear masks"
4,"I came here for dinner after a show during peak dinner hours and the wait was actually a lot shorter than I expected. I left my name and walked around and I got a notification about 15mins that my table was ready. The atmosphere is casual and loud. The seating was a bit tight and my table was very close to the tables beside me. 

FOOD:
In terms of food, I enjoyed most of the dishes I had. My favorites included the octopus and the bucatini. There was one dish that I didn&apos;t like which is the milk braised berkshire shoulder. The item seemed interesting so I decided to give it a try. The pork was tender but I didn&apos;t love the flavor profile of it. 

OVERALL:
I enjoyed most of the foods that I had and the service was great. I would highly recommend this restaurant."
5,"Not gonna lie, I&apos;m normally a non-believer in fancy cuisine, but my friend who was visiting wanted to come here, and now I can&apos;t wait to go back. We came early and enjoyed being the only guests for brunch. It&apos;s a beautiful restaurant with great service. All three dishes we tried, we liked."
5,Actually I changed my mind. Sometimes it takes time to learn what true greatness really is.
4,"TL;DR
What to order:
- Italian Feast - unfortunately it looks like they&apos;ve moved onto the &quot;Greek Feast&quot; :( - $18 per person + tax + tip

What to watch out for
- we specified 5:30 as the pickup time but they messaged us way earlier around 4pm to come pickup the food; when we got the food it was still somewhat warm but I don&apos;t understand why they didn&apos;t stick to the specified time...

=====

Ordered the Italian feast for 2 a couple weeks ago using Tock and it was really good! It comes with chicken cacciatore with potatoes; a salad with goat cheese, beets, and roasted asparagus; and a baked pasta with cheese and pork neckbone gravy. 

The highlights were definitely the chicken in the cacciatore, the asparagus in the salad, and the pasta was really good as a whole! The chicken fell off the bone and was extremely tender, the pasta was perfectly al dente, and everything in general was very flavorful. The portion sizes were fine and we spread out all the food across maybe two-ish meals each. They give you one salad box per person but everything else just comes in one container.

Some lowlights were that in the 2-person portion we got maybe 3 or so pieces of chicken and a lot of potato. The salad&apos;s dressing was also quite sweet, but as far as salads go, I mean, it was fine (I don&apos;t eat salads for the taste, I&apos;m afraid).

Overall I would love to try their other takeout options! ~$20 per person for the Purple Pig is a pretty darned good deal compared to their normal prices, and for the quality of food you get. Only docking a star for the pickup time snafu."
3,Perhaps they had an off night. Everything was... good... but modes not compare to places down south.
5,"On my 35th birthday I finally got to try The Purple Pig after all these years. Every time I&apos;ve gone in the past, I haven&apos;t had any luck because they usually don&apos;t take reservations and the wait was always so long; however, because of COVID-19, they are now taking reservations!

They definitely lived up to the hype after all these years and I was super happy with all the menu items we ordered. My favorite dish was the crispy pig ears with kale. It was like having elevated Chicharrón with crispy kale. The pickled banana peppers added the proper amount of acidity and the yolk from the fried egg soaked up all the flavors perfectly.

If you&apos;re looking for comfort food, the milk braise pork shoulder provided all of that. The gravy was mind blowing! Throw in some great cocktails and wine pairings and The Purple Pig is the perfect casual-chic restaurant for tourists and locals alike! You can&apos;t go wrong with any menu item here!"
5,"We came here to celebrate our anniversary. This place is known for long wait times and not allowing reservations. Not luckily, but luckily because of COVID, they are currently doing reservations. So we&apos;re able to walk in with our reservation and get a table right away. I will admit, this place was very casual and I felt like we were over dressed. They were very professional throughout the night and did really great explaining every dish and giving directions on how to eat the food so you can get the best taste out of each dish. Jimmy Bannos Jr. even stopped by our table to talk a little bit and made sure we were enjoying our night. 

We started off our night with a couple of drinks. My wife ordered their &quot;Paloma&quot; and I was feeling rich and magical that night and ordered their &quot;24 Carrot Magic.&quot; The Paloma was a simple classic made with Espolon blanco tequila, lime juice and grapefruit soda. It&apos;s really hard to get this one wrong. Definitely tasty. The 24 carrot Magic was something different. This one came with corazon reposado tequila, ancho Reyes Chile liqueur, carrot juice, lime juice and ginger syrup. A drink with a kick of heat, thanks to the ancho Reyes Chile liqueur. Never heard of such liqueur and is now on my list of things to buy! The carrot juice was overpower and made the drink taste healthy. I just wish they had the wider selection of drinks, the at least the drinks we both got were fantastic. 

We started off with their Crispy Pigs Ear and ended up with a total of four entries plus dessert. 

Crispy Pigs Ear-This seems to be a very popular dish. It&apos;s served with salty crispy pigs ear, mixed with kale, and pickled banana peppers and topped with a fried egg. You must break the yolk so it serves as a dressing to the pigs ear and mix it all together. If you just eat the pigs ear by itself, it will be too salty. The egg, kale and banana peppers helps balance all the flavors. Not sure if I&apos;d get this again though. 

Chicken thigh kebabs-You get two perfectly seasoned chicken kebabs on top of four fried smashed potatoes with Tzatziki sauce at the bottom. The chicken was very tender and went perfectly with their tasty tzatziki sauce. The potatoes we&apos;re good and worked as a starchy filler. The dish was tasty but $20 for two chicken kebabs was a tad bit much. Wouldn&apos;t mind ordering again, but would probably try some other plates next time. 

Whipped Feta- This dish was tasty. It came with toast and plenty of whipped feta to spread on the toast. The whipped feta came with cucumber and marinated tomatoes. The tomatoes were very tasty and tasted sweet. I would definitely order this dish again. 

Roasted Bone Marrow- This dish was my favorite dish of the night. It came with herbs, capers and onions with a side of Maldonado sea salt. You spread the bone marrow on the toast, grab some of the salt and sprinkle it on top, and then you top it off with the greens. A perfect bite every time. I would order this dish again and again. 

For dessert we opted for their popular &quot;Sicilian Iris.&quot; I will admit by dessert time, we were already stuffed, and whenever we&apos;re completely full we skip dessert. But since it was our anniversary and since it&apos;s the Purple Pig, we had to try a little bit of everything. The Sicilian iris, was tasty. It came warm and the fried ball was huge. It came stuffed ricotta, and chocolate chip. It reminded me of a warm gooey ball version of a cannoli. I wouldn&apos;t mind ordering this again. 

Overall, The Purple Pig hype is real. Everything was phenomenal. Flaw customer service, delicious food. Will definitely be returning."
5,"I had a great time at The Purple Pig. They recently opened the outdoor so I decided to give it a try. I was lucky to get a reservation spot on Tock. The reservation does require a $20 fee which will be applied to the check, but sometimes they might forget, so you want to check the final bill. The outdoor area was very small- maybe 5-6 tables, but it was fenced off and had its own trailer bathroom. 
We ordered the duck, pork shoulder, pork belly, broccoli and sweet corn. They were all really good.
The drinks were good as the portions were generous and there were a lot of alcohol in them- which is a plus!
All the meat dishes were very tender and the vegetable dishes were really nice too. It was one of the best broccoli dishes I have tried! The pork belly was a bit fatty, but it was soft and well cooked. The pork shoulder was meaty and the gravy, mashed potato and meat all went very well together.
The duck was massive, but still very soft and juicy. 
Some reviews mentioned that the portions are small but we had more than enough food and walked out very full.
I am not sure if this is worth the hype or the wait in the pre-covid period, but I thought the prices are relatively reasonable for the quality of food and there are many good options. Perhaps not the best in Chicago, but definitely the best in River North around Michigan Ave :)"
5,"Great place! 
Quite tasty and very affordable! Recently my friend and I went to this amazing restaurant. We ordered their best-seller food, and we were so pleased to find it wonderful! It was really tasty.  Both of us were pleased with the food and the operation. 
Thank you very much to all of you, guys!"
5,"We celebrated our anniversary in Chicago and one of our favorite spots was the Purple Pig. We were sad that it was just the two of us, because we wanted to order one of everything on the menu, but that would turn us into the purple pigs, so we went with a few favorites. The wait was minimal, and gave us a chance to sample some cheese and wine before we dined.

The dishes are rich and full of flavor, but we would have licked the plates if it wasn&apos;t rude to do in public-ha!

Some of our favorites were the Spanish octopus, pork jowl, pork liver pate, salt beets, and scallops. We kept seeing the turkey leg go by, but were so full, we couldn&apos;t make it work. Oh well, I guess we have to go back."
3,"Service was good. And food was okay. Their portions weren&apos;t very impressive &amp; the cost is quite high. I noticed they move their restaurant. I&apos;ve heard such great things about this restaurant and although food was good; it just wasn&apos;t THAT good. They have a $20 non refundable deposit to reserve a table. I assume it&apos;s cause of the pandemic and they don&apos;t want to hold a table for a no show. Everyone was socially distanced and staffs were wearing masks so it looks like they&apos;re honoring the safety guidelines. They also checked our temperature upon arrival. I definitely don&apos;t regret coming to try the food but don&apos;t think I&apos;ll go back just because the price is too high, portion size isn&apos;t too impressive, &amp; food was just average."
5,"My FAVORITE restaurant in all of Chicago hands down! The menu changes often but always features delicious, unique flavors. All the ingredients are so fresh and crafted together so perfectly. If on the menu- the broccoli, hot dog, and duck have been some of my all time favorites! You really can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu though. For the quality of food, it&apos;s very reasonably priced and worth every penny."
5,"I&apos;ve heard quite a bit about the Purple Pig,  but never found the time to go. This morning, we decided to go to their brunch. I am glad I did as it was one of the best brunches I have ever had in the city. 

I started out with a Paloma which was expertly made. We decided to go with the charcuterie board with sopressa and duck procuttio . Both are made in house. I thought the sopressa was excellent and the duck was ok. I think I&apos;ll go with another meat next time. The cheese was outstanding, but expected. The surprising Star was the bread....mmmmmmm. This board was the real deal. This seems like the thing to get with wine! 

My group shared three dishes: Chicken and Waffles, Avocado Toast, and French omelette. The omelette was expected, but excellent. A solid dish! The surprise was the Avocado Toast  which was a guacamole with the acid coming from the olives and cucumbers. It was a weird combo, but it worked! The chicken and waffles were the best I&apos;ve ever had! The waffle was more savory than sweet which I loved. The chicken was pretty epic too! 

Yes, this place is pretty pricey, but well worth the price! I knew it was good, but I never imagined it would be THAT good! One of the best brunches I&apos;ve had in Chicago, no question!"

crispy pig ears - these were way too salty for my taste but I liked the crunch
ricotta gnocchi-so cheesy and decadent but definitely heavy!
the bacon and liver pate-this was my absolute fav!!! It was so tasty
the pork belly-so tender and fatty with a really good sauce
The rib hash off the brunch menu-I loved that it came with an egg and the rib meat was tender.

Really good shared plates and they had a good selection of wine and cocktails!"
5,"Our company had a small corporate party (just around 8 people) and we&apos;ve decided to check out the Purple pig. And it was absolutely awesome decision as the food is very delicious, pork was crispy and tasty. They also have a good  wine menu. Everyone got satisfied of that evening.
And what is also important, the staff wear masks"
4,"I came here for dinner after a show during peak dinner hours and the wait was actually a lot shorter than I expected. I left my name and walked around and I got a notification about 15mins that my table was ready. The atmosphere is casual and loud. The seating was a bit tight and my table was very close to the tables beside me. 

FOOD:
In terms of food, I enjoyed most of the dishes I had. My favorites included the octopus and the bucatini. There was one dish that I didn&apos;t like which is the milk braised berkshire shoulder. The item seemed interesting so I decided to give it a try. The pork was tender but I didn&apos;t love the flavor profile of it. 

OVERALL:
I enjoyed most of the foods that I had and the service was great. I would highly recommend this restaurant."
5,"Not gonna lie, I&apos;m normally a non-believer in fancy cuisine, but my friend who was visiting wanted to come here, and now I can&apos;t wait to go back. We came early and enjoyed being the only guests for brunch. It&apos;s a beautiful restaurant with great service. All three dishes we tried, we liked."
5,Actually I changed my mind. Sometimes it takes time to learn what true greatness really is.
4,"TL;DR
What to order:
- Italian Feast - unfortunately it looks like they&apos;ve moved onto the &quot;Greek Feast&quot; :( - $18 per person + tax + tip

What to watch out for
- we specified 5:30 as the pickup time but they messaged us way earlier around 4pm to come pickup the food; when we got the food it was still somewhat warm but I don&apos;t understand why they didn&apos;t stick to the specified time...

=====

Ordered the Italian feast for 2 a couple weeks ago using Tock and it was really good! It comes with chicken cacciatore with potatoes; a salad with goat cheese, beets, and roasted asparagus; and a baked pasta with cheese and pork neckbone gravy. 

The highlights were definitely the chicken in the cacciatore, the asparagus in the salad, and the pasta was really good as a whole! The chicken fell off the bone and was extremely tender, the pasta was perfectly al dente, and everything in general was very flavorful. The portion sizes were fine and we spread out all the food across maybe two-ish meals each. They give you one salad box per person but everything else just comes in one container.

Some lowlights were that in the 2-person portion we got maybe 3 or so pieces of chicken and a lot of potato. The salad&apos;s dressing was also quite sweet, but as far as salads go, I mean, it was fine (I don&apos;t eat salads for the taste, I&apos;m afraid).

Overall I would love to try their other takeout options! ~$20 per person for the Purple Pig is a pretty darned good deal compared to their normal prices, and for the quality of food you get. Only docking a star for the pickup time snafu."
3,Perhaps they had an off night. Everything was... good... but modes not compare to places down south.
5,"On my 35th birthday I finally got to try The Purple Pig after all these years. Every time I&apos;ve gone in the past, I haven&apos;t had any luck because they usually don&apos;t take reservations and the wait was always so long; however, because of COVID-19, they are now taking reservations!

They definitely lived up to the hype after all these years and I was super happy with all the menu items we ordered. My favorite dish was the crispy pig ears with kale. It was like having elevated Chicharrón with crispy kale. The pickled banana peppers added the proper amount of acidity and the yolk from the fried egg soaked up all the flavors perfectly.

If you&apos;re looking for comfort food, the milk braise pork shoulder provided all of that. The gravy was mind blowing! Throw in some great cocktails and wine pairings and The Purple Pig is the perfect casual-chic restaurant for tourists and locals alike! You can&apos;t go wrong with any menu item here!"
5,"We came here to celebrate our anniversary. This place is known for long wait times and not allowing reservations. Not luckily, but luckily because of COVID, they are currently doing reservations. So we&apos;re able to walk in with our reservation and get a table right away. I will admit, this place was very casual and I felt like we were over dressed. They were very professional throughout the night and did really great explaining every dish and giving directions on how to eat the food so you can get the best taste out of each dish. Jimmy Bannos Jr. even stopped by our table to talk a little bit and made sure we were enjoying our night. 

We started off our night with a couple of drinks. My wife ordered their &quot;Paloma&quot; and I was feeling rich and magical that night and ordered their &quot;24 Carrot Magic.&quot; The Paloma was a simple classic made with Espolon blanco tequila, lime juice and grapefruit soda. It&apos;s really hard to get this one wrong. Definitely tasty. The 24 carrot Magic was something different. This one came with corazon reposado tequila, ancho Reyes Chile liqueur, carrot juice, lime juice and ginger syrup. A drink with a kick of heat, thanks to the ancho Reyes Chile liqueur. Never heard of such liqueur and is now on my list of things to buy! The carrot juice was overpower and made the drink taste healthy. I just wish they had the wider selection of drinks, the at least the drinks we both got were fantastic. 

We started off with their Crispy Pigs Ear and ended up with a total of four entries plus dessert. 

Crispy Pigs Ear-This seems to be a very popular dish. It&apos;s served with salty crispy pigs ear, mixed with kale, and pickled banana peppers and topped with a fried egg. You must break the yolk so it serves as a dressing to the pigs ear and mix it all together. If you just eat the pigs ear by itself, it will be too salty. The egg, kale and banana peppers helps balance all the flavors. Not sure if I&apos;d get this again though. 

Chicken thigh kebabs-You get two perfectly seasoned chicken kebabs on top of four fried smashed potatoes with Tzatziki sauce at the bottom. The chicken was very tender and went perfectly with their tasty tzatziki sauce. The potatoes we&apos;re good and worked as a starchy filler. The dish was tasty but $20 for two chicken kebabs was a tad bit much. Wouldn&apos;t mind ordering again, but would probably try some other plates next time. 

Whipped Feta- This dish was tasty. It came with toast and plenty of whipped feta to spread on the toast. The whipped feta came with cucumber and marinated tomatoes. The tomatoes were very tasty and tasted sweet. I would definitely order this dish again. 

Roasted Bone Marrow- This dish was my favorite dish of the night. It came with herbs, capers and onions with a side of Maldonado sea salt. You spread the bone marrow on the toast, grab some of the salt and sprinkle it on top, and then you top it off with the greens. A perfect bite every time. I would order this dish again and again. 

For dessert we opted for their popular &quot;Sicilian Iris.&quot; I will admit by dessert time, we were already stuffed, and whenever we&apos;re completely full we skip dessert. But since it was our anniversary and since it&apos;s the Purple Pig, we had to try a little bit of everything. The Sicilian iris, was tasty. It came warm and the fried ball was huge. It came stuffed ricotta, and chocolate chip. It reminded me of a warm gooey ball version of a cannoli. I wouldn&apos;t mind ordering this again. 

Overall, The Purple Pig hype is real. Everything was phenomenal. Flaw customer service, delicious food. Will definitely be returning."
5,"I had a great time at The Purple Pig. They recently opened the outdoor so I decided to give it a try. I was lucky to get a reservation spot on Tock. The reservation does require a $20 fee which will be applied to the check, but sometimes they might forget, so you want to check the final bill. The outdoor area was very small- maybe 5-6 tables, but it was fenced off and had its own trailer bathroom. 
We ordered the duck, pork shoulder, pork belly, broccoli and sweet corn. They were all really good.
The drinks were good as the portions were generous and there were a lot of alcohol in them- which is a plus!
All the meat dishes were very tender and the vegetable dishes were really nice too. It was one of the best broccoli dishes I have tried! The pork belly was a bit fatty, but it was soft and well cooked. The pork shoulder was meaty and the gravy, mashed potato and meat all went very well together.
The duck was massive, but still very soft and juicy. 
Some reviews mentioned that the portions are small but we had more than enough food and walked out very full.
I am not sure if this is worth the hype or the wait in the pre-covid period, but I thought the prices are relatively reasonable for the quality of food and there are many good options. Perhaps not the best in Chicago, but definitely the best in River North around Michigan Ave :)"
5,"Great place! 
Quite tasty and very affordable! Recently my friend and I went to this amazing restaurant. We ordered their best-seller food, and we were so pleased to find it wonderful! It was really tasty.  Both of us were pleased with the food and the operation. 
Thank you very much to all of you, guys!"
5,"We celebrated our anniversary in Chicago and one of our favorite spots was the Purple Pig. We were sad that it was just the two of us, because we wanted to order one of everything on the menu, but that would turn us into the purple pigs, so we went with a few favorites. The wait was minimal, and gave us a chance to sample some cheese and wine before we dined.

The dishes are rich and full of flavor, but we would have licked the plates if it wasn&apos;t rude to do in public-ha!

Some of our favorites were the Spanish octopus, pork jowl, pork liver pate, salt beets, and scallops. We kept seeing the turkey leg go by, but were so full, we couldn&apos;t make it work. Oh well, I guess we have to go back."
3,"Service was good. And food was okay. Their portions weren&apos;t very impressive &amp; the cost is quite high. I noticed they move their restaurant. I&apos;ve heard such great things about this restaurant and although food was good; it just wasn&apos;t THAT good. They have a $20 non refundable deposit to reserve a table. I assume it&apos;s cause of the pandemic and they don&apos;t want to hold a table for a no show. Everyone was socially distanced and staffs were wearing masks so it looks like they&apos;re honoring the safety guidelines. They also checked our temperature upon arrival. I definitely don&apos;t regret coming to try the food but don&apos;t think I&apos;ll go back just because the price is too high, portion size isn&apos;t too impressive, &amp; food was just average."
5,"My FAVORITE restaurant in all of Chicago hands down! The menu changes often but always features delicious, unique flavors. All the ingredients are so fresh and crafted together so perfectly. If on the menu- the broccoli, hot dog, and duck have been some of my all time favorites! You really can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu though. For the quality of food, it&apos;s very reasonably priced and worth every penny."
5,"I&apos;ve heard quite a bit about the Purple Pig,  but never found the time to go. This morning, we decided to go to their brunch. I am glad I did as it was one of the best brunches I have ever had in the city. 

I started out with a Paloma which was expertly made. We decided to go with the charcuterie board with sopressa and duck procuttio . Both are made in house. I thought the sopressa was excellent and the duck was ok. I think I&apos;ll go with another meat next time. The cheese was outstanding, but expected. The surprising Star was the bread....mmmmmmm. This board was the real deal. This seems like the thing to get with wine! 

My group shared three dishes: Chicken and Waffles, Avocado Toast, and French omelette. The omelette was expected, but excellent. A solid dish! The surprise was the Avocado Toast  which was a guacamole with the acid coming from the olives and cucumbers. It was a weird combo, but it worked! The chicken and waffles were the best I&apos;ve ever had! The waffle was more savory than sweet which I loved. The chicken was pretty epic too! 

Yes, this place is pretty pricey, but well worth the price! I knew it was good, but I never imagined it would be THAT good! One of the best brunches I&apos;ve had in Chicago, no question!"
5,"The milk braised pork shoulder is one of the best dishes I have had in Chicago. Bone marrow is also a must, the presentation was incredible and makes for a fun food-sharing experience. At least 3-4 dishes for two people."
5,A great place to stop by in Chicago. Try to reserve a table ahead of time to make sure you don&apos;t have to wait an hour or more. Definitely great service and good recommendations. Will definitely come back to try new things next time!
4,"Only came here for happy hour, but had a good experience.  My friends and I sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and attentive.  It was quiet when we arrived, but filled up after work (this was pre-COVID precautions).  Their happy hours specials were a good deal, and also tasted good.  The food menu looked good, so I would love to go back at some time to try a good meal (or at least happy hour with some appetizers)."
5,"Great menu, great service, unique food! A real treat! Will be back! This is an innovative, very creative menu."
4,"FOOD: Tapas with a heavy emphasis on MEAT. The COVID menu is a bit smaller than what I remembered from my last visit, but they had a great cheese/charcuterie selection (including a prosciutto duck!) and fan favorites pork shoulder and belly. The food is rich and full and the flavors are certainly not what you would expect from typical tapas 

SERVICE: Prompt service with great attitudes. No issues here

EXPERIENCE: The new location has multiple indoor seating options as well as a patio out back

VALUE: Deceiving large portion sizes. Between two people, we had two appetizers and two entrees and had enough for a full meals worth of left overs. Appetizers are about $10-15 and entrees $20-35

SUMMARY: Amazing meats and intriguing menu. This place is a classic and well worth the wait. Have come back multiple times and will continue to do so in the future"

- we specified 5:30 as the pickup time but they messaged us way earlier around 4pm to come pickup the food; when we got the food it was still somewhat warm but I don&apos;t understand why they didn&apos;t stick to the specified time...

=====

Ordered the Italian feast for 2 a couple weeks ago using Tock and it was really good! It comes with chicken cacciatore with potatoes; a salad with goat cheese, beets, and roasted asparagus; and a baked pasta with cheese and pork neckbone gravy. 

The highlights were definitely the chicken in the cacciatore, the asparagus in the salad, and the pasta was really good as a whole! The chicken fell off the bone and was extremely tender, the pasta was perfectly al dente, and everything in general was very flavorful. The portion sizes were fine and we spread out all the food across maybe two-ish meals each. They give you one salad box per person but everything else just comes in one container.

Some lowlights were that in the 2-person portion we got maybe 3 or so pieces of chicken and a lot of potato. The salad&apos;s dressing was also quite sweet, but as far as salads go, I mean, it was fine (I don&apos;t eat salads for the taste, I&apos;m afraid).

Overall I would love to try their other takeout options! ~$20 per person for the Purple Pig is a pretty darned good deal compared to their normal prices, and for the quality of food you get. Only docking a star for the pickup time snafu."
3,Perhaps they had an off night. Everything was... good... but modes not compare to places down south.
5,"On my 35th birthday I finally got to try The Purple Pig after all these years. Every time I&apos;ve gone in the past, I haven&apos;t had any luck because they usually don&apos;t take reservations and the wait was always so long; however, because of COVID-19, they are now taking reservations!

They definitely lived up to the hype after all these years and I was super happy with all the menu items we ordered. My favorite dish was the crispy pig ears with kale. It was like having elevated Chicharrón with crispy kale. The pickled banana peppers added the proper amount of acidity and the yolk from the fried egg soaked up all the flavors perfectly.

If you&apos;re looking for comfort food, the milk braise pork shoulder provided all of that. The gravy was mind blowing! Throw in some great cocktails and wine pairings and The Purple Pig is the perfect casual-chic restaurant for tourists and locals alike! You can&apos;t go wrong with any menu item here!"
5,"We came here to celebrate our anniversary. This place is known for long wait times and not allowing reservations. Not luckily, but luckily because of COVID, they are currently doing reservations. So we&apos;re able to walk in with our reservation and get a table right away. I will admit, this place was very casual and I felt like we were over dressed. They were very professional throughout the night and did really great explaining every dish and giving directions on how to eat the food so you can get the best taste out of each dish. Jimmy Bannos Jr. even stopped by our table to talk a little bit and made sure we were enjoying our night. 

We started off our night with a couple of drinks. My wife ordered their &quot;Paloma&quot; and I was feeling rich and magical that night and ordered their &quot;24 Carrot Magic.&quot; The Paloma was a simple classic made with Espolon blanco tequila, lime juice and grapefruit soda. It&apos;s really hard to get this one wrong. Definitely tasty. The 24 carrot Magic was something different. This one came with corazon reposado tequila, ancho Reyes Chile liqueur, carrot juice, lime juice and ginger syrup. A drink with a kick of heat, thanks to the ancho Reyes Chile liqueur. Never heard of such liqueur and is now on my list of things to buy! The carrot juice was overpower and made the drink taste healthy. I just wish they had the wider selection of drinks, the at least the drinks we both got were fantastic. 

We started off with their Crispy Pigs Ear and ended up with a total of four entries plus dessert. 

Crispy Pigs Ear-This seems to be a very popular dish. It&apos;s served with salty crispy pigs ear, mixed with kale, and pickled banana peppers and topped with a fried egg. You must break the yolk so it serves as a dressing to the pigs ear and mix it all together. If you just eat the pigs ear by itself, it will be too salty. The egg, kale and banana peppers helps balance all the flavors. Not sure if I&apos;d get this again though. 

Chicken thigh kebabs-You get two perfectly seasoned chicken kebabs on top of four fried smashed potatoes with Tzatziki sauce at the bottom. The chicken was very tender and went perfectly with their tasty tzatziki sauce. The potatoes we&apos;re good and worked as a starchy filler. The dish was tasty but $20 for two chicken kebabs was a tad bit much. Wouldn&apos;t mind ordering again, but would probably try some other plates next time. 

Whipped Feta- This dish was tasty. It came with toast and plenty of whipped feta to spread on the toast. The whipped feta came with cucumber and marinated tomatoes. The tomatoes were very tasty and tasted sweet. I would definitely order this dish again. 

Roasted Bone Marrow- This dish was my favorite dish of the night. It came with herbs, capers and onions with a side of Maldonado sea salt. You spread the bone marrow on the toast, grab some of the salt and sprinkle it on top, and then you top it off with the greens. A perfect bite every time. I would order this dish again and again. 

For dessert we opted for their popular &quot;Sicilian Iris.&quot; I will admit by dessert time, we were already stuffed, and whenever we&apos;re completely full we skip dessert. But since it was our anniversary and since it&apos;s the Purple Pig, we had to try a little bit of everything. The Sicilian iris, was tasty. It came warm and the fried ball was huge. It came stuffed ricotta, and chocolate chip. It reminded me of a warm gooey ball version of a cannoli. I wouldn&apos;t mind ordering this again. 

Overall, The Purple Pig hype is real. Everything was phenomenal. Flaw customer service, delicious food. Will definitely be returning."
5,"I had a great time at The Purple Pig. They recently opened the outdoor so I decided to give it a try. I was lucky to get a reservation spot on Tock. The reservation does require a $20 fee which will be applied to the check, but sometimes they might forget, so you want to check the final bill. The outdoor area was very small- maybe 5-6 tables, but it was fenced off and had its own trailer bathroom. 
We ordered the duck, pork shoulder, pork belly, broccoli and sweet corn. They were all really good.
The drinks were good as the portions were generous and there were a lot of alcohol in them- which is a plus!
All the meat dishes were very tender and the vegetable dishes were really nice too. It was one of the best broccoli dishes I have tried! The pork belly was a bit fatty, but it was soft and well cooked. The pork shoulder was meaty and the gravy, mashed potato and meat all went very well together.
The duck was massive, but still very soft and juicy. 
Some reviews mentioned that the portions are small but we had more than enough food and walked out very full.
I am not sure if this is worth the hype or the wait in the pre-covid period, but I thought the prices are relatively reasonable for the quality of food and there are many good options. Perhaps not the best in Chicago, but definitely the best in River North around Michigan Ave :)"
5,"Great place! 
Quite tasty and very affordable! Recently my friend and I went to this amazing restaurant. We ordered their best-seller food, and we were so pleased to find it wonderful! It was really tasty.  Both of us were pleased with the food and the operation. 
Thank you very much to all of you, guys!"
5,"We celebrated our anniversary in Chicago and one of our favorite spots was the Purple Pig. We were sad that it was just the two of us, because we wanted to order one of everything on the menu, but that would turn us into the purple pigs, so we went with a few favorites. The wait was minimal, and gave us a chance to sample some cheese and wine before we dined.

The dishes are rich and full of flavor, but we would have licked the plates if it wasn&apos;t rude to do in public-ha!

Some of our favorites were the Spanish octopus, pork jowl, pork liver pate, salt beets, and scallops. We kept seeing the turkey leg go by, but were so full, we couldn&apos;t make it work. Oh well, I guess we have to go back."
3,"Service was good. And food was okay. Their portions weren&apos;t very impressive &amp; the cost is quite high. I noticed they move their restaurant. I&apos;ve heard such great things about this restaurant and although food was good; it just wasn&apos;t THAT good. They have a $20 non refundable deposit to reserve a table. I assume it&apos;s cause of the pandemic and they don&apos;t want to hold a table for a no show. Everyone was socially distanced and staffs were wearing masks so it looks like they&apos;re honoring the safety guidelines. They also checked our temperature upon arrival. I definitely don&apos;t regret coming to try the food but don&apos;t think I&apos;ll go back just because the price is too high, portion size isn&apos;t too impressive, &amp; food was just average."
5,"My FAVORITE restaurant in all of Chicago hands down! The menu changes often but always features delicious, unique flavors. All the ingredients are so fresh and crafted together so perfectly. If on the menu- the broccoli, hot dog, and duck have been some of my all time favorites! You really can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu though. For the quality of food, it&apos;s very reasonably priced and worth every penny."
5,"I&apos;ve heard quite a bit about the Purple Pig,  but never found the time to go. This morning, we decided to go to their brunch. I am glad I did as it was one of the best brunches I have ever had in the city. 

I started out with a Paloma which was expertly made. We decided to go with the charcuterie board with sopressa and duck procuttio . Both are made in house. I thought the sopressa was excellent and the duck was ok. I think I&apos;ll go with another meat next time. The cheese was outstanding, but expected. The surprising Star was the bread....mmmmmmm. This board was the real deal. This seems like the thing to get with wine! 

My group shared three dishes: Chicken and Waffles, Avocado Toast, and French omelette. The omelette was expected, but excellent. A solid dish! The surprise was the Avocado Toast  which was a guacamole with the acid coming from the olives and cucumbers. It was a weird combo, but it worked! The chicken and waffles were the best I&apos;ve ever had! The waffle was more savory than sweet which I loved. The chicken was pretty epic too! 

Yes, this place is pretty pricey, but well worth the price! I knew it was good, but I never imagined it would be THAT good! One of the best brunches I&apos;ve had in Chicago, no question!"
5,"The milk braised pork shoulder is one of the best dishes I have had in Chicago. Bone marrow is also a must, the presentation was incredible and makes for a fun food-sharing experience. At least 3-4 dishes for two people."
5,A great place to stop by in Chicago. Try to reserve a table ahead of time to make sure you don&apos;t have to wait an hour or more. Definitely great service and good recommendations. Will definitely come back to try new things next time!
4,"Only came here for happy hour, but had a good experience.  My friends and I sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and attentive.  It was quiet when we arrived, but filled up after work (this was pre-COVID precautions).  Their happy hours specials were a good deal, and also tasted good.  The food menu looked good, so I would love to go back at some time to try a good meal (or at least happy hour with some appetizers)."
5,"Great menu, great service, unique food! A real treat! Will be back! This is an innovative, very creative menu."
4,"FOOD: Tapas with a heavy emphasis on MEAT. The COVID menu is a bit smaller than what I remembered from my last visit, but they had a great cheese/charcuterie selection (including a prosciutto duck!) and fan favorites pork shoulder and belly. The food is rich and full and the flavors are certainly not what you would expect from typical tapas 

SERVICE: Prompt service with great attitudes. No issues here

EXPERIENCE: The new location has multiple indoor seating options as well as a patio out back

VALUE: Deceiving large portion sizes. Between two people, we had two appetizers and two entrees and had enough for a full meals worth of left overs. Appetizers are about $10-15 and entrees $20-35

SUMMARY: Amazing meats and intriguing menu. This place is a classic and well worth the wait. Have come back multiple times and will continue to do so in the future"
5,"If you are looking for a good wine and tapas place in Chicago this is the way to go!! 

We came here on a Sunday morning around 11:30am and it wasn&apos;t too busy. The service was great and our server told us how it works here as it&apos;s mostly shared plates so about 5 plates was good for the 4 of us. 

We ordered:
crispy pig ears - these were way too salty for my taste but I liked the crunch
ricotta gnocchi-so cheesy and decadent but definitely heavy!
the bacon and liver pate-this was my absolute fav!!! It was so tasty
the pork belly-so tender and fatty with a really good sauce
The rib hash off the brunch menu-I loved that it came with an egg and the rib meat was tender.

Really good shared plates and they had a good selection of wine and cocktails!"
5,"Our company had a small corporate party (just around 8 people) and we&apos;ve decided to check out the Purple pig. And it was absolutely awesome decision as the food is very delicious, pork was crispy and tasty. They also have a good  wine menu. Everyone got satisfied of that evening.
And what is also important, the staff wear masks"
4,"I came here for dinner after a show during peak dinner hours and the wait was actually a lot shorter than I expected. I left my name and walked around and I got a notification about 15mins that my table was ready. The atmosphere is casual and loud. The seating was a bit tight and my table was very close to the tables beside me. 

FOOD:
In terms of food, I enjoyed most of the dishes I had. My favorites included the octopus and the bucatini. There was one dish that I didn&apos;t like which is the milk braised berkshire shoulder. The item seemed interesting so I decided to give it a try. The pork was tender but I didn&apos;t love the flavor profile of it. 

OVERALL:
I enjoyed most of the foods that I had and the service was great. I would highly recommend this restaurant."
5,"Not gonna lie, I&apos;m normally a non-believer in fancy cuisine, but my friend who was visiting wanted to come here, and now I can&apos;t wait to go back. We came early and enjoyed being the only guests for brunch. It&apos;s a beautiful restaurant with great service. All three dishes we tried, we liked."
5,Actually I changed my mind. Sometimes it takes time to learn what true greatness really is.
