4,"This place is probably amazing on a summer Friday or Saturday night in a non-COVID world.  Go here with your date and get some ice cream to share.  Hell yeah!

In COVID times, it&apos;s not quite as good.  No seating, of course, and a very small selection of candies.  The ice cream, and especially the milkshakes, are just as good, however!  And the staff could not be nicer.  Good prices as well."
5,"Do yourself a favor and get the Bucktown Sundae - 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream, fudge, marshmallow, banana, whipped cream, nuts, and a cherry. Plenty for two people. Yummmm!!!"
5,"Certain places in Chicago you must see. The Bean, Millennium Park, the Zoo, Botanical Gardens, get Tavern style pizza (real Chicago style) and go to Margie&apos;s for ice cream. This is an absolutely iconic institution and you won&apos;t regret coming here at all. I love the western avenue location, I believe it&apos;s the original. 

Located right off western avenue, there is easy expressway access and tons of street parking. You can also use the lot at Lazos Tacos which is across the street. The employee are all very friendly and a lot of them have been there for a long time. If you plan on eating there, it may be crowded to get a table, but we usually get ours to go. 

Now the ice cream... WOW. Come here hungry because the portions here are huge. Shakes, sundaes, malts, they legit have everything. The sundaes come in almost mixing bowl size bowls and you could easily share one. I&apos;m preferential to the Royal fudge shake. Basically an awesome chocolate shake and has a banana. Seriously one of the best shakes you&apos;ll have. Prices are good considering how much you get and how good it is. 

Take the drive and get yourself an ice cream treat."
3,"Margie&apos;s is a throwback ice cream joint. 

Inside looks like it has not been redone since they opened.

I love the og registers at the tables.

Service was good, order came out fast. 

Turtle Sundae - $7.95 - Got Vanilla and Pistachio. Ice cream tasted like the stuff you get from Thrifty. Scoops were decent sized. Comes with sauce and a wafer cookie. 

Cool place to try if you want to step back in time but ice cream was nothing special and a bit overpriced."
3,This is the original location (there&apos;s another one on Montrose) and both locations are so small &amp; crowded inside. Not too much table seating options. We waited for quite some time for a table &amp; the lady who served us was quite rude and didn&apos;t seem like she enjoyed her job.. it was a Sunday night but yet it was house packed. The portions are huge and price is reasonable. But don&apos;t think I&apos;d wanna come back. I used to go to the Montrose location all the time so maybe I&apos;ll stick with that location . The ice cream is good but it isn&apos;t THAT good. Also the place doesn&apos;t seem like it&apos;s the cleanest place either.
5,"I mean I truly have no complaints about Margie&apos;s ! Got seated right away, service was so quick and the ice cream was AWESOME ! What makes this place so unique and nostalgic is how it&apos;s been in Chicago since the 20&apos;s which is just so beyond amazing ! Someone opened for that long deserved foodies like us to go check it out ! 
We got the brownie a la mode ! 
TIP: you can adjust it the way you like it which is awesome ! 
Removed the nuts and added cookie and cream ice cream (instead of doing plain vanilla or chocolate) 
Great decision !! I loved it so much ! It hit the spot after a whole day in Chicago !
Don&apos;t forget the homemade fudge they make ! Drool worthy and makes whatever you get just 50x better !"
3,"This ice cream sundae shop has some fun Chicago lore--the cherry on top being the Beatles&apos; visit to the location back in the 60s. While the place still has that historic feel to it and echoes the old Peterson&apos;s ice cream parlor to me, the furniture is in desperate need of an overhaul. The seats seem dirty and sticky. One of the members in my party had no fluff or spring in his cushion, so he sat down and just sank into the seat. Not the best image to present. 

In terms of the food, the menu could use some clarity. The ice cream sundaes are solid but the menu doesn&apos;t do the best job of explaining them. I ordered a sundae that came with raspberries but no hot fudge...doesn&apos;t sound like a sundae to me! I went with banana ice cream but it had a weird artificial taste to it. I&apos;ll just go with vanilla the next time. The whipped cream is good and the presentation of the sundae is wonderful. I love the conch bowls and the little pitchers for the topping. My raspberry topping was too tart for my liking. I&apos;m a hot fudge connoisseur and their take on hot fudge just didn&apos;t work for me. It tasted like melted baking chocolate and butter--way to rich and tummy-ache inducing for me. 

As a heads up, service is SLOW and there is a line if you want to sit down and order."
4,"The not-so-good: Crowded store, kind of brusque service, questionable bathrooms.

The good: OMG massive VATS of ice cream with gravy boats of hot fudge!!!

I don&apos;t remember exactly what we ordered, but the two sundaes we ordered were lacquered with caramel and nuts and whipped cream. The ice cream itself was fantastic. We customized our sundaes with a bunch of different flavors -- chocolate chip, coffee, praline, chocolate, and cheesecake. Surprisingly, the cheesecake was the best. One of the sundaes come with a homemade turtle, which was amazing.

Serving sizes were insane. A two-scoop sundae is more than enough for two people!"
3,"DEFINITELY NOT THE PLACE TO GO IF YOU ARE BRINGING YOUR FAMILY!!  THE REASON, VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE, ESPECIALLY SINCE COVIT, YOU HAVE TO FIGURE AT LEAST $13 TO $20 PER PERSON---meaning by the time you order just ice cream, you will spend at least $50 for 4 and not even eat!.  see i live in the neighborhood (bucktown) and i always would go there and get a small one scoop strawberry sundae, which they would normally put in a nice rectangle box with the bottom full of the one scoop, whip cream strawberries and a cherry...and it was about five bucks, now for SEVEN BUCKS, you get a smaller scoop, three strawberries, some whip cream, enough nuts that you can actually count each and every one of them, and one half of a cherry!!  and they ring it up on an old banger cash register that does not even record the sale!!  (skimming??--that&apos;s between them and the irs, but i&apos;m sure it is rampant!!)  

now imagine ordering a regular sundae, about three bucks more, or one of their &quot;creations&quot;, you will easily get to at least 15 per person, so know that before you come here, and you&apos;ll be ok.  (BY THE WAY, THE FREEZE ON ARMITAGE AND CALIFORNIA IS A MUCH BETTER DEAL WHEN THEY OPEN IN THE SPRING--AND JUST AS GOOD).  

I LOVE ICE CREAM, i&apos;ve been to them all (rainbow, homer&apos;s, gerties, etc...even the old zephyr and lockwood castle), margies ice cream is good, but deninitely not a seven dollar small sundae good....the butter fat and process is just not there.  maybe they&apos;re taking advantage of covid, i&apos;m sure they are, and now instead of me being a 20 time + per year customer, they will get me once or twice after this one, and that will be only when i am desperate for ice cream and don&apos;t feel like going elsewhere.

and so you know, yes, the dining room when open still has that 1950&apos;s vibe, but all the seating is tight and i don&apos;t think it has been updated or repaired since installation, and the bathroom is a hot tight mess.  i don&apos;t know how the city lets them get away with one bathroom for their seating.  i think they do more in the way of cleaning other than wiping the tables, but i&apos;m not sure as i&apos;ve never seen it.

good luck, go elsewhere"
5,OMG! If you looking for dessert as a dinner go here! The portions are very large and everything is delicious! My personal favorite is BROWNIE ALA MODE.. Yum! Be ready for a wait on the weekends and summer nights as it is a quite popular spot. The wait is worth it though.
5,"Margie&apos;s is a Chicago staple!  It has been around for 100 years and was packed on a Sunday night, in winter!  The staff is so sweet and efficient, and the ice cream is out of this world.  The menu is HUGE with endless ice cream and sundae options.  

I got the waffle cone sundae with chocolate ice cream, which was classic.  The &quot;brownie a la mode&quot; is hands down the best thing on the menu, though, so much bang for your buck!

Special shoutout to the man clearing the tables, he was so sweet and attentive and definitely got lots of tips from us :)"
5,This place has been around forever... and the inside decor hasn&apos;t changed!  But the ice cream and taffy apples are fresh! There&apos;s usually a little bit of a wait unless you get there later in the evening then the wait times are ridiculous. This place is a definite must for some great ice cream!!
5,"Ice cream
I whend whit my bf
This time but i bring family  &amp; friends are well
We order banana split butter scotch 
3 balls of ice cream
Pretty good"
5,"Even though this place has been around forever, I was finally able to try it for the first time and it really lived up to the hype! We had to wait for 20-30 minutes or so before we were seated but it was so worth it. The sundae is sooo good and my favorite part is that they give you hot fudge and caramel sauces on the side that you can pour onto the ice cream yourself. Makes it such a fun experiences! Their sundaes are also huge so definitely great to share."
5,"Enough to share!! I got a two scoop Sunday and shared with my brother, we didn&apos;t even finish it. I definitely recommend sharing these beasts. The restaurant itself carries a few sandwiches and light lunch options but I think we all know the desserts are the highlight. 

The Sunday we had was delicious! Covered in whipped cream, hot fudge to pour, and wafers to dip. So fun and a tasty treat. The menu offers many flavors combinations in terms of ice cream flavors and toppings. Overwhelming in the best way. Everything tastes fresh and looked pleasant, which in my opinion is important with dessert."
5,Simply incredible I love coming here. Anyone who has not tried it needs to.What more can I say.
4,"Okay, now THIS is Chicago, am I right? Everybody who&apos;s been living here for a while has at least seen or heard of this shoppe before. One of the oldest eatery in the city, most famous for their delicious assortment of ice cream and chocolates. Once you walk in the establishment, it feels like you&apos;re walking into a time capsule, back into the past century, with old timey photos of Margie&apos;s upbringings along with miscellaneous tools and toys from the early 20th century; this is almost like a little museum with amazing ice cream!

Now I&apos;m not a huge fan of ice cream but I&apos;ll have it at times when I&apos;m in the mood for it, so I had something basic, two scoops of ice cream with Margie&apos;s signature fudge and a little turtle. It certainly hit the spot on a hot summer night, and I could definitely see the appeal as the restaurant is fit for all types of crowds. Thing is, if you&apos;re dining in, prepare to wait a while to get your order in. This place always seems to be crowded, especially at night. Still worth the trip! Ice cream fan or not!"
5,"Chicago Classic!!
Whether you&apos;re visiting or from the Windy City. Margie&apos;s is the go-to for ice cream sundaes and fudge! They are pretty much opened everyday of the year except major holidays or severe weather. Sitting is limited/tight but you instantly get a flashback to the beginning days with the old school decor and jukeboxes on the tables(don&apos;t work, I&apos;ve always tried lbvs). Service is always quick and with a great attitude despite the flow of people going in and out. They have over 30+ variations and flavors so trust me what you&apos;re looking for has to be here. They also serve soup/sandwich/salad specials in case you wanted to snack before your dessert. Parking is available around the corner, so you might have to take a small walk but totally worth it. (:"
5,"This was my first time coming here. Everyone would say it was an amazing place. I finally tried it after so long and let me tell you..... it&apos;s AMAZING!! I love sweets, the ice cream isn&apos;t as bad as like some how they just fill you up and u feel sick after. I got a Hot Caramel banana split. They give u a perfect sizing for it nothing over the top!! You can choose your own ice cream. Recommend coming here if you&apos;re from Chicago or just visiting"
4,"Staple for desserts. Got takeout here on a Saturday evening. Giggles suggest takeout over waiting in line for a table, it&apos;s always crowded. Banana split will strawberry, vanilla, and pecan ice cream. Ice cream was very good, wafer on the split was a nice touch. Dessert was a very large portion, plenty to share.

THE REASON, VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE, ESPECIALLY SINCE COVIT, YOU HAVE TO FIGURE AT LEAST $13 TO $20 PER PERSON---meaning by the time you order just ice cream, you will spend at least $50 for 4 and not even eat!.  see i live in the neighborhood (bucktown) and i always would go there and get a small one scoop strawberry sundae, which they would normally put in a nice rectangle box with the bottom full of the one scoop, whip cream strawberries and a cherry...and it was about five bucks, now for SEVEN BUCKS, you get a smaller scoop, three strawberries, some whip cream, enough nuts that you can actually count each and every one of them, and one half of a cherry!!  and they ring it up on an old banger cash register that does not even record the sale!!  (skimming??--that&apos;s between them and the irs, but i&apos;m sure it is rampant!!)  

now imagine ordering a regular sundae, about three bucks more, or one of their &quot;creations&quot;, you will easily get to at least 15 per person, so know that before you come here, and you&apos;ll be ok.  (BY THE WAY, THE FREEZE ON ARMITAGE AND CALIFORNIA IS A MUCH BETTER DEAL WHEN THEY OPEN IN THE SPRING--AND JUST AS GOOD).  

I LOVE ICE CREAM, i&apos;ve been to them all (rainbow, homer&apos;s, gerties, etc...even the old zephyr and lockwood castle), margies ice cream is good, but deninitely not a seven dollar small sundae good....the butter fat and process is just not there.  maybe they&apos;re taking advantage of covid, i&apos;m sure they are, and now instead of me being a 20 time + per year customer, they will get me once or twice after this one, and that will be only when i am desperate for ice cream and don&apos;t feel like going elsewhere.

and so you know, yes, the dining room when open still has that 1950&apos;s vibe, but all the seating is tight and i don&apos;t think it has been updated or repaired since installation, and the bathroom is a hot tight mess.  i don&apos;t know how the city lets them get away with one bathroom for their seating.  i think they do more in the way of cleaning other than wiping the tables, but i&apos;m not sure as i&apos;ve never seen it.

good luck, go elsewhere"
5,OMG! If you looking for dessert as a dinner go here! The portions are very large and everything is delicious! My personal favorite is BROWNIE ALA MODE.. Yum! Be ready for a wait on the weekends and summer nights as it is a quite popular spot. The wait is worth it though.
5,"Margie&apos;s is a Chicago staple!  It has been around for 100 years and was packed on a Sunday night, in winter!  The staff is so sweet and efficient, and the ice cream is out of this world.  The menu is HUGE with endless ice cream and sundae options.  

I got the waffle cone sundae with chocolate ice cream, which was classic.  The &quot;brownie a la mode&quot; is hands down the best thing on the menu, though, so much bang for your buck!

Special shoutout to the man clearing the tables, he was so sweet and attentive and definitely got lots of tips from us :)"
5,This place has been around forever... and the inside decor hasn&apos;t changed!  But the ice cream and taffy apples are fresh! There&apos;s usually a little bit of a wait unless you get there later in the evening then the wait times are ridiculous. This place is a definite must for some great ice cream!!
5,"Ice cream
I whend whit my bf
This time but i bring family  &amp; friends are well
We order banana split butter scotch 
3 balls of ice cream
Pretty good"
5,"Even though this place has been around forever, I was finally able to try it for the first time and it really lived up to the hype! We had to wait for 20-30 minutes or so before we were seated but it was so worth it. The sundae is sooo good and my favorite part is that they give you hot fudge and caramel sauces on the side that you can pour onto the ice cream yourself. Makes it such a fun experiences! Their sundaes are also huge so definitely great to share."
5,"Enough to share!! I got a two scoop Sunday and shared with my brother, we didn&apos;t even finish it. I definitely recommend sharing these beasts. The restaurant itself carries a few sandwiches and light lunch options but I think we all know the desserts are the highlight. 

The Sunday we had was delicious! Covered in whipped cream, hot fudge to pour, and wafers to dip. So fun and a tasty treat. The menu offers many flavors combinations in terms of ice cream flavors and toppings. Overwhelming in the best way. Everything tastes fresh and looked pleasant, which in my opinion is important with dessert."
5,Simply incredible I love coming here. Anyone who has not tried it needs to.What more can I say.
4,"Okay, now THIS is Chicago, am I right? Everybody who&apos;s been living here for a while has at least seen or heard of this shoppe before. One of the oldest eatery in the city, most famous for their delicious assortment of ice cream and chocolates. Once you walk in the establishment, it feels like you&apos;re walking into a time capsule, back into the past century, with old timey photos of Margie&apos;s upbringings along with miscellaneous tools and toys from the early 20th century; this is almost like a little museum with amazing ice cream!

Now I&apos;m not a huge fan of ice cream but I&apos;ll have it at times when I&apos;m in the mood for it, so I had something basic, two scoops of ice cream with Margie&apos;s signature fudge and a little turtle. It certainly hit the spot on a hot summer night, and I could definitely see the appeal as the restaurant is fit for all types of crowds. Thing is, if you&apos;re dining in, prepare to wait a while to get your order in. This place always seems to be crowded, especially at night. Still worth the trip! Ice cream fan or not!"
5,"Chicago Classic!!
Whether you&apos;re visiting or from the Windy City. Margie&apos;s is the go-to for ice cream sundaes and fudge! They are pretty much opened everyday of the year except major holidays or severe weather. Sitting is limited/tight but you instantly get a flashback to the beginning days with the old school decor and jukeboxes on the tables(don&apos;t work, I&apos;ve always tried lbvs). Service is always quick and with a great attitude despite the flow of people going in and out. They have over 30+ variations and flavors so trust me what you&apos;re looking for has to be here. They also serve soup/sandwich/salad specials in case you wanted to snack before your dessert. Parking is available around the corner, so you might have to take a small walk but totally worth it. (:"
5,"This was my first time coming here. Everyone would say it was an amazing place. I finally tried it after so long and let me tell you..... it&apos;s AMAZING!! I love sweets, the ice cream isn&apos;t as bad as like some how they just fill you up and u feel sick after. I got a Hot Caramel banana split. They give u a perfect sizing for it nothing over the top!! You can choose your own ice cream. Recommend coming here if you&apos;re from Chicago or just visiting"
4,"Staple for desserts. Got takeout here on a Saturday evening. Giggles suggest takeout over waiting in line for a table, it&apos;s always crowded. Banana split will strawberry, vanilla, and pecan ice cream. Ice cream was very good, wafer on the split was a nice touch. Dessert was a very large portion, plenty to share. One of the better places to visit in the city for ice cream sundaes."
4,"This place is probably amazing on a summer Friday or Saturday night in a non-COVID world.  Go here with your date and get some ice cream to share.  Hell yeah!

In COVID times, it&apos;s not quite as good.  No seating, of course, and a very small selection of candies.  The ice cream, and especially the milkshakes, are just as good, however!  And the staff could not be nicer.  Good prices as well."
5,"Do yourself a favor and get the Bucktown Sundae - 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream, fudge, marshmallow, banana, whipped cream, nuts, and a cherry. Plenty for two people. Yummmm!!!"
5,"Certain places in Chicago you must see. The Bean, Millennium Park, the Zoo, Botanical Gardens, get Tavern style pizza (real Chicago style) and go to Margie&apos;s for ice cream. This is an absolutely iconic institution and you won&apos;t regret coming here at all. I love the western avenue location, I believe it&apos;s the original. 

Located right off western avenue, there is easy expressway access and tons of street parking. You can also use the lot at Lazos Tacos which is across the street. The employee are all very friendly and a lot of them have been there for a long time. If you plan on eating there, it may be crowded to get a table, but we usually get ours to go. 

Now the ice cream... WOW. Come here hungry because the portions here are huge. Shakes, sundaes, malts, they legit have everything. The sundaes come in almost mixing bowl size bowls and you could easily share one. I&apos;m preferential to the Royal fudge shake. Basically an awesome chocolate shake and has a banana. Seriously one of the best shakes you&apos;ll have. Prices are good considering how much you get and how good it is. 

Take the drive and get yourself an ice cream treat."
3,"Margie&apos;s is a throwback ice cream joint. 

Inside looks like it has not been redone since they opened.

I love the og registers at the tables.

Service was good, order came out fast. 

Turtle Sundae - $7.95 - Got Vanilla and Pistachio. Ice cream tasted like the stuff you get from Thrifty. Scoops were decent sized. Comes with sauce and a wafer cookie. 

Cool place to try if you want to step back in time but ice cream was nothing special and a bit overpriced."
3,This is the original location (there&apos;s another one on Montrose) and both locations are so small &amp; crowded inside. Not too much table seating options. We waited for quite some time for a table &amp; the lady who served us was quite rude and didn&apos;t seem like she enjoyed her job.. it was a Sunday night but yet it was house packed. The portions are huge and price is reasonable. But don&apos;t think I&apos;d wanna come back. I used to go to the Montrose location all the time so maybe I&apos;ll stick with that location . The ice cream is good but it isn&apos;t THAT good. Also the place doesn&apos;t seem like it&apos;s the cleanest place either.
5,"I mean I truly have no complaints about Margie&apos;s ! Got seated right away, service was so quick and the ice cream was AWESOME ! What makes this place so unique and nostalgic is how it&apos;s been in Chicago since the 20&apos;s which is just so beyond amazing ! Someone opened for that long deserved foodies like us to go check it out ! 
We got the brownie a la mode ! 
TIP: you can adjust it the way you like it which is awesome ! 
Removed the nuts and added cookie and cream ice cream (instead of doing plain vanilla or chocolate) 
Great decision !! I loved it so much ! It hit the spot after a whole day in Chicago !
Don&apos;t forget the homemade fudge they make ! Drool worthy and makes whatever you get just 50x better !"
3,"This ice cream sundae shop has some fun Chicago lore--the cherry on top being the Beatles&apos; visit to the location back in the 60s. While the place still has that historic feel to it and echoes the old Peterson&apos;s ice cream parlor to me, the furniture is in desperate need of an overhaul. The seats seem dirty and sticky. One of the members in my party had no fluff or spring in his cushion, so he sat down and just sank into the seat. Not the best image to present. 

In terms of the food, the menu could use some clarity. The ice cream sundaes are solid but the menu doesn&apos;t do the best job of explaining them. I ordered a sundae that came with raspberries but no hot fudge...doesn&apos;t sound like a sundae to me! I went with banana ice cream but it had a weird artificial taste to it. I&apos;ll just go with vanilla the next time. The whipped cream is good and the presentation of the sundae is wonderful. I love the conch bowls and the little pitchers for the topping. My raspberry topping was too tart for my liking. I&apos;m a hot fudge connoisseur and their take on hot fudge just didn&apos;t work for me. It tasted like melted baking chocolate and butter--way to rich and tummy-ache inducing for me. 

As a heads up, service is SLOW and there is a line if you want to sit down and order."
4,"The not-so-good: Crowded store, kind of brusque service, questionable bathrooms.

The good: OMG massive VATS of ice cream with gravy boats of hot fudge!!!

I don&apos;t remember exactly what we ordered, but the two sundaes we ordered were lacquered with caramel and nuts and whipped cream. The ice cream itself was fantastic. We customized our sundaes with a bunch of different flavors -- chocolate chip, coffee, praline, chocolate, and cheesecake. Surprisingly, the cheesecake was the best. One of the sundaes come with a homemade turtle, which was amazing.

Serving sizes were insane. A two-scoop sundae is more than enough for two people!"

Thing is, if you&apos;re dining in, prepare to wait a while to get your order in. This place always seems to be crowded, especially at night. Still worth the trip! Ice cream fan or not!"
5,"Chicago Classic!!
Whether you&apos;re visiting or from the Windy City. Margie&apos;s is the go-to for ice cream sundaes and fudge! They are pretty much opened everyday of the year except major holidays or severe weather. Sitting is limited/tight but you instantly get a flashback to the beginning days with the old school decor and jukeboxes on the tables(don&apos;t work, I&apos;ve always tried lbvs). Service is always quick and with a great attitude despite the flow of people going in and out. They have over 30+ variations and flavors so trust me what you&apos;re looking for has to be here. They also serve soup/sandwich/salad specials in case you wanted to snack before your dessert. Parking is available around the corner, so you might have to take a small walk but totally worth it. (:"
5,"This was my first time coming here. Everyone would say it was an amazing place. I finally tried it after so long and let me tell you..... it&apos;s AMAZING!! I love sweets, the ice cream isn&apos;t as bad as like some how they just fill you up and u feel sick after. I got a Hot Caramel banana split. They give u a perfect sizing for it nothing over the top!! You can choose your own ice cream. Recommend coming here if you&apos;re from Chicago or just visiting"
4,"Staple for desserts. Got takeout here on a Saturday evening. Giggles suggest takeout over waiting in line for a table, it&apos;s always crowded. Banana split will strawberry, vanilla, and pecan ice cream. Ice cream was very good, wafer on the split was a nice touch. Dessert was a very large portion, plenty to share. One of the better places to visit in the city for ice cream sundaes."
4,"This place is probably amazing on a summer Friday or Saturday night in a non-COVID world.  Go here with your date and get some ice cream to share.  Hell yeah!

In COVID times, it&apos;s not quite as good.  No seating, of course, and a very small selection of candies.  The ice cream, and especially the milkshakes, are just as good, however!  And the staff could not be nicer.  Good prices as well."
5,"Do yourself a favor and get the Bucktown Sundae - 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream, fudge, marshmallow, banana, whipped cream, nuts, and a cherry. Plenty for two people. Yummmm!!!"
5,"Certain places in Chicago you must see. The Bean, Millennium Park, the Zoo, Botanical Gardens, get Tavern style pizza (real Chicago style) and go to Margie&apos;s for ice cream. This is an absolutely iconic institution and you won&apos;t regret coming here at all. I love the western avenue location, I believe it&apos;s the original. 

Located right off western avenue, there is easy expressway access and tons of street parking. You can also use the lot at Lazos Tacos which is across the street. The employee are all very friendly and a lot of them have been there for a long time. If you plan on eating there, it may be crowded to get a table, but we usually get ours to go. 

Now the ice cream... WOW. Come here hungry because the portions here are huge. Shakes, sundaes, malts, they legit have everything. The sundaes come in almost mixing bowl size bowls and you could easily share one. I&apos;m preferential to the Royal fudge shake. Basically an awesome chocolate shake and has a banana. Seriously one of the best shakes you&apos;ll have. Prices are good considering how much you get and how good it is. 

Take the drive and get yourself an ice cream treat."
3,"Margie&apos;s is a throwback ice cream joint. 

Inside looks like it has not been redone since they opened.

I love the og registers at the tables.

Service was good, order came out fast. 

Turtle Sundae - $7.95 - Got Vanilla and Pistachio. Ice cream tasted like the stuff you get from Thrifty. Scoops were decent sized. Comes with sauce and a wafer cookie. 

Cool place to try if you want to step back in time but ice cream was nothing special and a bit overpriced."
3,This is the original location (there&apos;s another one on Montrose) and both locations are so small &amp; crowded inside. Not too much table seating options. We waited for quite some time for a table &amp; the lady who served us was quite rude and didn&apos;t seem like she enjoyed her job.. it was a Sunday night but yet it was house packed. The portions are huge and price is reasonable. But don&apos;t think I&apos;d wanna come back. I used to go to the Montrose location all the time so maybe I&apos;ll stick with that location . The ice cream is good but it isn&apos;t THAT good. Also the place doesn&apos;t seem like it&apos;s the cleanest place either.
5,"I mean I truly have no complaints about Margie&apos;s ! Got seated right away, service was so quick and the ice cream was AWESOME ! What makes this place so unique and nostalgic is how it&apos;s been in Chicago since the 20&apos;s which is just so beyond amazing ! Someone opened for that long deserved foodies like us to go check it out ! 
We got the brownie a la mode ! 
TIP: you can adjust it the way you like it which is awesome ! 
Removed the nuts and added cookie and cream ice cream (instead of doing plain vanilla or chocolate) 
Great decision !! I loved it so much ! It hit the spot after a whole day in Chicago !
Don&apos;t forget the homemade fudge they make ! Drool worthy and makes whatever you get just 50x better !"
3,"This ice cream sundae shop has some fun Chicago lore--the cherry on top being the Beatles&apos; visit to the location back in the 60s. While the place still has that historic feel to it and echoes the old Peterson&apos;s ice cream parlor to me, the furniture is in desperate need of an overhaul. The seats seem dirty and sticky. One of the members in my party had no fluff or spring in his cushion, so he sat down and just sank into the seat. Not the best image to present. 

In terms of the food, the menu could use some clarity. The ice cream sundaes are solid but the menu doesn&apos;t do the best job of explaining them. I ordered a sundae that came with raspberries but no hot fudge...doesn&apos;t sound like a sundae to me! I went with banana ice cream but it had a weird artificial taste to it. I&apos;ll just go with vanilla the next time. The whipped cream is good and the presentation of the sundae is wonderful. I love the conch bowls and the little pitchers for the topping. My raspberry topping was too tart for my liking. I&apos;m a hot fudge connoisseur and their take on hot fudge just didn&apos;t work for me. It tasted like melted baking chocolate and butter--way to rich and tummy-ache inducing for me. 

As a heads up, service is SLOW and there is a line if you want to sit down and order."
4,"The not-so-good: Crowded store, kind of brusque service, questionable bathrooms.

The good: OMG massive VATS of ice cream with gravy boats of hot fudge!!!

I don&apos;t remember exactly what we ordered, but the two sundaes we ordered were lacquered with caramel and nuts and whipped cream. The ice cream itself was fantastic. We customized our sundaes with a bunch of different flavors -- chocolate chip, coffee, praline, chocolate, and cheesecake. Surprisingly, the cheesecake was the best. One of the sundaes come with a homemade turtle, which was amazing.

Serving sizes were insane. A two-scoop sundae is more than enough for two people!"
3,"DEFINITELY NOT THE PLACE TO GO IF YOU ARE BRINGING YOUR FAMILY!!  THE REASON, VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE, ESPECIALLY SINCE COVIT, YOU HAVE TO FIGURE AT LEAST $13 TO $20 PER PERSON---meaning by the time you order just ice cream, you will spend at least $50 for 4 and not even eat!.  see i live in the neighborhood (bucktown) and i always would go there and get a small one scoop strawberry sundae, which they would normally put in a nice rectangle box with the bottom full of the one scoop, whip cream strawberries and a cherry...and it was about five bucks, now for SEVEN BUCKS, you get a smaller scoop, three strawberries, some whip cream, enough nuts that you can actually count each and every one of them, and one half of a cherry!!  and they ring it up on an old banger cash register that does not even record the sale!!  (skimming??--that&apos;s between them and the irs, but i&apos;m sure it is rampant!!)  

now imagine ordering a regular sundae, about three bucks more, or one of their &quot;creations&quot;, you will easily get to at least 15 per person, so know that before you come here, and you&apos;ll be ok.  (BY THE WAY, THE FREEZE ON ARMITAGE AND CALIFORNIA IS A MUCH BETTER DEAL WHEN THEY OPEN IN THE SPRING--AND JUST AS GOOD).  

I LOVE ICE CREAM, i&apos;ve been to them all (rainbow, homer&apos;s, gerties, etc...even the old zephyr and lockwood castle), margies ice cream is good, but deninitely not a seven dollar small sundae good....the butter fat and process is just not there.  maybe they&apos;re taking advantage of covid, i&apos;m sure they are, and now instead of me being a 20 time + per year customer, they will get me once or twice after this one, and that will be only when i am desperate for ice cream and don&apos;t feel like going elsewhere.

and so you know, yes, the dining room when open still has that 1950&apos;s vibe, but all the seating is tight and i don&apos;t think it has been updated or repaired since installation, and the bathroom is a hot tight mess.  i don&apos;t know how the city lets them get away with one bathroom for their seating.  i think they do more in the way of cleaning other than wiping the tables, but i&apos;m not sure as i&apos;ve never seen it.

good luck, go elsewhere"
5,OMG! If you looking for dessert as a dinner go here! The portions are very large and everything is delicious! My personal favorite is BROWNIE ALA MODE.. Yum! Be ready for a wait on the weekends and summer nights as it is a quite popular spot. The wait is worth it though.
5,"Margie&apos;s is a Chicago staple!  It has been around for 100 years and was packed on a Sunday night, in winter!  The staff is so sweet and efficient, and the ice cream is out of this world.  The menu is HUGE with endless ice cream and sundae options.  

I got the waffle cone sundae with chocolate ice cream, which was classic.  The &quot;brownie a la mode&quot; is hands down the best thing on the menu, though, so much bang for your buck!

Special shoutout to the man clearing the tables, he was so sweet and attentive and definitely got lots of tips from us :)"
5,This place has been around forever... and the inside decor hasn&apos;t changed!  But the ice cream and taffy apples are fresh! There&apos;s usually a little bit of a wait unless you get there later in the evening then the wait times are ridiculous. This place is a definite must for some great ice cream!!
5,"Ice cream
I whend whit my bf
This time but i bring family  &amp; friends are well
We order banana split butter scotch 
3 balls of ice cream
Pretty good"
5,"Even though this place has been around forever, I was finally able to try it for the first time and it really lived up to the hype! We had to wait for 20-30 minutes or so before we were seated but it was so worth it. The sundae is sooo good and my favorite part is that they give you hot fudge and caramel sauces on the side that you can pour onto the ice cream yourself. Makes it such a fun experiences! Their sundaes are also huge so definitely great to share."
5,"Enough to share!! I got a two scoop Sunday and shared with my brother, we didn&apos;t even finish it. I definitely recommend sharing these beasts. The restaurant itself carries a few sandwiches and light lunch options but I think we all know the desserts are the highlight. 

The Sunday we had was delicious! Covered in whipped cream, hot fudge to pour, and wafers to dip. So fun and a tasty treat. The menu offers many flavors combinations in terms of ice cream flavors and toppings. Overwhelming in the best way. Everything tastes fresh and looked pleasant, which in my opinion is important with dessert."
5,Simply incredible I love coming here. Anyone who has not tried it needs to.What more can I say.

3,"This ice cream sundae shop has some fun Chicago lore--the cherry on top being the Beatles&apos; visit to the location back in the 60s. While the place still has that historic feel to it and echoes the old Peterson&apos;s ice cream parlor to me, the furniture is in desperate need of an overhaul. The seats seem dirty and sticky. One of the members in my party had no fluff or spring in his cushion, so he sat down and just sank into the seat. Not the best image to present. 

In terms of the food, the menu could use some clarity. The ice cream sundaes are solid but the menu doesn&apos;t do the best job of explaining them. I ordered a sundae that came with raspberries but no hot fudge...doesn&apos;t sound like a sundae to me! I went with banana ice cream but it had a weird artificial taste to it. I&apos;ll just go with vanilla the next time. The whipped cream is good and the presentation of the sundae is wonderful. I love the conch bowls and the little pitchers for the topping. My raspberry topping was too tart for my liking. I&apos;m a hot fudge connoisseur and their take on hot fudge just didn&apos;t work for me. It tasted like melted baking chocolate and butter--way to rich and tummy-ache inducing for me. 

As a heads up, service is SLOW and there is a line if you want to sit down and order."
4,"The not-so-good: Crowded store, kind of brusque service, questionable bathrooms.

The good: OMG massive VATS of ice cream with gravy boats of hot fudge!!!

I don&apos;t remember exactly what we ordered, but the two sundaes we ordered were lacquered with caramel and nuts and whipped cream. The ice cream itself was fantastic. We customized our sundaes with a bunch of different flavors -- chocolate chip, coffee, praline, chocolate, and cheesecake. Surprisingly, the cheesecake was the best. One of the sundaes come with a homemade turtle, which was amazing.

Serving sizes were insane. A two-scoop sundae is more than enough for two people!"
3,"DEFINITELY NOT THE PLACE TO GO IF YOU ARE BRINGING YOUR FAMILY!!  THE REASON, VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE, ESPECIALLY SINCE COVIT, YOU HAVE TO FIGURE AT LEAST $13 TO $20 PER PERSON---meaning by the time you order just ice cream, you will spend at least $50 for 4 and not even eat!.  see i live in the neighborhood (bucktown) and i always would go there and get a small one scoop strawberry sundae, which they would normally put in a nice rectangle box with the bottom full of the one scoop, whip cream strawberries and a cherry...and it was about five bucks, now for SEVEN BUCKS, you get a smaller scoop, three strawberries, some whip cream, enough nuts that you can actually count each and every one of them, and one half of a cherry!!  and they ring it up on an old banger cash register that does not even record the sale!!  (skimming??--that&apos;s between them and the irs, but i&apos;m sure it is rampant!!)  

now imagine ordering a regular sundae, about three bucks more, or one of their &quot;creations&quot;, you will easily get to at least 15 per person, so know that before you come here, and you&apos;ll be ok.  (BY THE WAY, THE FREEZE ON ARMITAGE AND CALIFORNIA IS A MUCH BETTER DEAL WHEN THEY OPEN IN THE SPRING--AND JUST AS GOOD).  

I LOVE ICE CREAM, i&apos;ve been to them all (rainbow, homer&apos;s, gerties, etc...even the old zephyr and lockwood castle), margies ice cream is good, but deninitely not a seven dollar small sundae good....the butter fat and process is just not there.  maybe they&apos;re taking advantage of covid, i&apos;m sure they are, and now instead of me being a 20 time + per year customer, they will get me once or twice after this one, and that will be only when i am desperate for ice cream and don&apos;t feel like going elsewhere.

and so you know, yes, the dining room when open still has that 1950&apos;s vibe, but all the seating is tight and i don&apos;t think it has been updated or repaired since installation, and the bathroom is a hot tight mess.  i don&apos;t know how the city lets them get away with one bathroom for their seating.  i think they do more in the way of cleaning other than wiping the tables, but i&apos;m not sure as i&apos;ve never seen it.

good luck, go elsewhere"
5,OMG! If you looking for dessert as a dinner go here! The portions are very large and everything is delicious! My personal favorite is BROWNIE ALA MODE.. Yum! Be ready for a wait on the weekends and summer nights as it is a quite popular spot. The wait is worth it though.
5,"Margie&apos;s is a Chicago staple!  It has been around for 100 years and was packed on a Sunday night, in winter!  The staff is so sweet and efficient, and the ice cream is out of this world.  The menu is HUGE with endless ice cream and sundae options.  

I got the waffle cone sundae with chocolate ice cream, which was classic.  The &quot;brownie a la mode&quot; is hands down the best thing on the menu, though, so much bang for your buck!

Special shoutout to the man clearing the tables, he was so sweet and attentive and definitely got lots of tips from us :)"
5,This place has been around forever... and the inside decor hasn&apos;t changed!  But the ice cream and taffy apples are fresh! There&apos;s usually a little bit of a wait unless you get there later in the evening then the wait times are ridiculous. This place is a definite must for some great ice cream!!
5,"Ice cream
I whend whit my bf
This time but i bring family  &amp; friends are well
We order banana split butter scotch 
3 balls of ice cream
Pretty good"
5,"Even though this place has been around forever, I was finally able to try it for the first time and it really lived up to the hype! We had to wait for 20-30 minutes or so before we were seated but it was so worth it. The sundae is sooo good and my favorite part is that they give you hot fudge and caramel sauces on the side that you can pour onto the ice cream yourself. Makes it such a fun experiences! Their sundaes are also huge so definitely great to share."
5,"Enough to share!! I got a two scoop Sunday and shared with my brother, we didn&apos;t even finish it. I definitely recommend sharing these beasts. The restaurant itself carries a few sandwiches and light lunch options but I think we all know the desserts are the highlight. 

The Sunday we had was delicious! Covered in whipped cream, hot fudge to pour, and wafers to dip. So fun and a tasty treat. The menu offers many flavors combinations in terms of ice cream flavors and toppings. Overwhelming in the best way. Everything tastes fresh and looked pleasant, which in my opinion is important with dessert."
5,Simply incredible I love coming here. Anyone who has not tried it needs to.What more can I say.
4,"Okay, now THIS is Chicago, am I right? Everybody who&apos;s been living here for a while has at least seen or heard of this shoppe before. One of the oldest eatery in the city, most famous for their delicious assortment of ice cream and chocolates. Once you walk in the establishment, it feels like you&apos;re walking into a time capsule, back into the past century, with old timey photos of Margie&apos;s upbringings along with miscellaneous tools and toys from the early 20th century; this is almost like a little museum with amazing ice cream!

Now I&apos;m not a huge fan of ice cream but I&apos;ll have it at times when I&apos;m in the mood for it, so I had something basic, two scoops of ice cream with Margie&apos;s signature fudge and a little turtle. It certainly hit the spot on a hot summer night, and I could definitely see the appeal as the restaurant is fit for all types of crowds. Thing is, if you&apos;re dining in, prepare to wait a while to get your order in. This place always seems to be crowded, especially at night. Still worth the trip! Ice cream fan or not!"
5,"Chicago Classic!!
Whether you&apos;re visiting or from the Windy City. Margie&apos;s is the go-to for ice cream sundaes and fudge! They are pretty much opened everyday of the year except major holidays or severe weather. Sitting is limited/tight but you instantly get a flashback to the beginning days with the old school decor and jukeboxes on the tables(don&apos;t work, I&apos;ve always tried lbvs). Service is always quick and with a great attitude despite the flow of people going in and out. They have over 30+ variations and flavors so trust me what you&apos;re looking for has to be here. They also serve soup/sandwich/salad specials in case you wanted to snack before your dessert. Parking is available around the corner, so you might have to take a small walk but totally worth it. (:"
5,"This was my first time coming here. Everyone would say it was an amazing place. I finally tried it after so long and let me tell you..... it&apos;s AMAZING!! I love sweets, the ice cream isn&apos;t as bad as like some how they just fill you up and u feel sick after. I got a Hot Caramel banana split. They give u a perfect sizing for it nothing over the top!! You can choose your own ice cream. Recommend coming here if you&apos;re from Chicago or just visiting"
4,"Staple for desserts. Got takeout here on a Saturday evening. Giggles suggest takeout over waiting in line for a table, it&apos;s always crowded. Banana split will strawberry, vanilla, and pecan ice cream. Ice cream was very good, wafer on the split was a nice touch. Dessert was a very large portion, plenty to share. One of the better places to visit in the city for ice cream sundaes."
4,"This place is probably amazing on a summer Friday or Saturday night in a non-COVID world.  Go here with your date and get some ice cream to share.  Hell yeah!

In COVID times, it&apos;s not quite as good.  No seating, of course, and a very small selection of candies.  The ice cream, and especially the milkshakes, are just as good, however!  And the staff could not be nicer.  Good prices as well."
5,"Do yourself a favor and get the Bucktown Sundae - 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream, fudge, marshmallow, banana, whipped cream, nuts, and a cherry. Plenty for two people. Yummmm!!!"
5,"Certain places in Chicago you must see. The Bean, Millennium Park, the Zoo, Botanical Gardens, get Tavern style pizza (real Chicago style) and go to Margie&apos;s for ice cream. This is an absolutely iconic institution and you won&apos;t regret coming here at all. I love the western avenue location, I believe it&apos;s the original. 

Located right off western avenue, there is easy expressway access and tons of street parking. You can also use the lot at Lazos Tacos which is across the street. The employee are all very friendly and a lot of them have been there for a long time. If you plan on eating there, it may be crowded to get a table, but we usually get ours to go. 

Now the ice cream... WOW. Come here hungry because the portions here are huge. Shakes, sundaes, malts, they legit have everything. The sundaes come in almost mixing bowl size bowls and you could easily share one. I&apos;m preferential to the Royal fudge shake. Basically an awesome chocolate shake and has a banana. Seriously one of the best shakes you&apos;ll have. Prices are good considering how much you get and how good it is. 

Take the drive and get yourself an ice cream treat."
3,"Margie&apos;s is a throwback ice cream joint. 

Inside looks like it has not been redone since they opened.

I love the og registers at the tables.

Service was good, order came out fast. 

Turtle Sundae - $7.95 - Got Vanilla and Pistachio. Ice cream tasted like the stuff you get from Thrifty. Scoops were decent sized. Comes with sauce and a wafer cookie. 

Cool place to try if you want to step back in time but ice cream was nothing special and a bit overpriced."
3,This is the original location (there&apos;s another one on Montrose) and both locations are so small &amp; crowded inside. Not too much table seating options. We waited for quite some time for a table &amp; the lady who served us was quite rude and didn&apos;t seem like she enjoyed her job.. it was a Sunday night but yet it was house packed. The portions are huge and price is reasonable. But don&apos;t think I&apos;d wanna come back. I used to go to the Montrose location all the time so maybe I&apos;ll stick with that location . The ice cream is good but it isn&apos;t THAT good. Also the place doesn&apos;t seem like it&apos;s the cleanest place either.
5,"I mean I truly have no complaints about Margie&apos;s ! Got seated right away, service was so quick and the ice cream was AWESOME ! What makes this place so unique and nostalgic is how it&apos;s been in Chicago since the 20&apos;s which is just so beyond amazing ! Someone opened for that long deserved foodies like us to go check it out ! 
We got the brownie a la mode ! 
TIP: you can adjust it the way you like it which is awesome ! 
Removed the nuts and added cookie and cream ice cream (instead of doing plain vanilla or chocolate) 
Great decision !! I loved it so much ! It hit the spot after a whole day in Chicago !

5,"Even though this place has been around forever, I was finally able to try it for the first time and it really lived up to the hype! We had to wait for 20-30 minutes or so before we were seated but it was so worth it. The sundae is sooo good and my favorite part is that they give you hot fudge and caramel sauces on the side that you can pour onto the ice cream yourself. Makes it such a fun experiences! Their sundaes are also huge so definitely great to share."
5,"Enough to share!! I got a two scoop Sunday and shared with my brother, we didn&apos;t even finish it. I definitely recommend sharing these beasts. The restaurant itself carries a few sandwiches and light lunch options but I think we all know the desserts are the highlight. 

The Sunday we had was delicious! Covered in whipped cream, hot fudge to pour, and wafers to dip. So fun and a tasty treat. The menu offers many flavors combinations in terms of ice cream flavors and toppings. Overwhelming in the best way. Everything tastes fresh and looked pleasant, which in my opinion is important with dessert."
5,Simply incredible I love coming here. Anyone who has not tried it needs to.What more can I say.
4,"Okay, now THIS is Chicago, am I right? Everybody who&apos;s been living here for a while has at least seen or heard of this shoppe before. One of the oldest eatery in the city, most famous for their delicious assortment of ice cream and chocolates. Once you walk in the establishment, it feels like you&apos;re walking into a time capsule, back into the past century, with old timey photos of Margie&apos;s upbringings along with miscellaneous tools and toys from the early 20th century; this is almost like a little museum with amazing ice cream!

Now I&apos;m not a huge fan of ice cream but I&apos;ll have it at times when I&apos;m in the mood for it, so I had something basic, two scoops of ice cream with Margie&apos;s signature fudge and a little turtle. It certainly hit the spot on a hot summer night, and I could definitely see the appeal as the restaurant is fit for all types of crowds. Thing is, if you&apos;re dining in, prepare to wait a while to get your order in. This place always seems to be crowded, especially at night. Still worth the trip! Ice cream fan or not!"
5,"Chicago Classic!!
Whether you&apos;re visiting or from the Windy City. Margie&apos;s is the go-to for ice cream sundaes and fudge! They are pretty much opened everyday of the year except major holidays or severe weather. Sitting is limited/tight but you instantly get a flashback to the beginning days with the old school decor and jukeboxes on the tables(don&apos;t work, I&apos;ve always tried lbvs). Service is always quick and with a great attitude despite the flow of people going in and out. They have over 30+ variations and flavors so trust me what you&apos;re looking for has to be here. They also serve soup/sandwich/salad specials in case you wanted to snack before your dessert. Parking is available around the corner, so you might have to take a small walk but totally worth it. (:"
5,"This was my first time coming here. Everyone would say it was an amazing place. I finally tried it after so long and let me tell you..... it&apos;s AMAZING!! I love sweets, the ice cream isn&apos;t as bad as like some how they just fill you up and u feel sick after. I got a Hot Caramel banana split. They give u a perfect sizing for it nothing over the top!! You can choose your own ice cream. Recommend coming here if you&apos;re from Chicago or just visiting"
4,"Staple for desserts. Got takeout here on a Saturday evening. Giggles suggest takeout over waiting in line for a table, it&apos;s always crowded. Banana split will strawberry, vanilla, and pecan ice cream. Ice cream was very good, wafer on the split was a nice touch. Dessert was a very large portion, plenty to share. One of the better places to visit in the city for ice cream sundaes."
4,"This place is probably amazing on a summer Friday or Saturday night in a non-COVID world.  Go here with your date and get some ice cream to share.  Hell yeah!

In COVID times, it&apos;s not quite as good.  No seating, of course, and a very small selection of candies.  The ice cream, and especially the milkshakes, are just as good, however!  And the staff could not be nicer.  Good prices as well."
5,"Do yourself a favor and get the Bucktown Sundae - 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream, fudge, marshmallow, banana, whipped cream, nuts, and a cherry. Plenty for two people. Yummmm!!!"
5,"Certain places in Chicago you must see. The Bean, Millennium Park, the Zoo, Botanical Gardens, get Tavern style pizza (real Chicago style) and go to Margie&apos;s for ice cream. This is an absolutely iconic institution and you won&apos;t regret coming here at all. I love the western avenue location, I believe it&apos;s the original. 

Located right off western avenue, there is easy expressway access and tons of street parking. You can also use the lot at Lazos Tacos which is across the street. The employee are all very friendly and a lot of them have been there for a long time. If you plan on eating there, it may be crowded to get a table, but we usually get ours to go. 

Now the ice cream... WOW. Come here hungry because the portions here are huge. Shakes, sundaes, malts, they legit have everything. The sundaes come in almost mixing bowl size bowls and you could easily share one. I&apos;m preferential to the Royal fudge shake. Basically an awesome chocolate shake and has a banana. Seriously one of the best shakes you&apos;ll have. Prices are good considering how much you get and how good it is. 

Take the drive and get yourself an ice cream treat."
3,"Margie&apos;s is a throwback ice cream joint. 

Inside looks like it has not been redone since they opened.

I love the og registers at the tables.

Service was good, order came out fast. 

Turtle Sundae - $7.95 - Got Vanilla and Pistachio. Ice cream tasted like the stuff you get from Thrifty. Scoops were decent sized. Comes with sauce and a wafer cookie. 

Cool place to try if you want to step back in time but ice cream was nothing special and a bit overpriced."
3,This is the original location (there&apos;s another one on Montrose) and both locations are so small &amp; crowded inside. Not too much table seating options. We waited for quite some time for a table &amp; the lady who served us was quite rude and didn&apos;t seem like she enjoyed her job.. it was a Sunday night but yet it was house packed. The portions are huge and price is reasonable. But don&apos;t think I&apos;d wanna come back. I used to go to the Montrose location all the time so maybe I&apos;ll stick with that location . The ice cream is good but it isn&apos;t THAT good. Also the place doesn&apos;t seem like it&apos;s the cleanest place either.
5,"I mean I truly have no complaints about Margie&apos;s ! Got seated right away, service was so quick and the ice cream was AWESOME ! What makes this place so unique and nostalgic is how it&apos;s been in Chicago since the 20&apos;s which is just so beyond amazing ! Someone opened for that long deserved foodies like us to go check it out ! 
We got the brownie a la mode ! 
TIP: you can adjust it the way you like it which is awesome ! 
Removed the nuts and added cookie and cream ice cream (instead of doing plain vanilla or chocolate) 
Great decision !! I loved it so much ! It hit the spot after a whole day in Chicago !
Don&apos;t forget the homemade fudge they make ! Drool worthy and makes whatever you get just 50x better !"
3,"This ice cream sundae shop has some fun Chicago lore--the cherry on top being the Beatles&apos; visit to the location back in the 60s. While the place still has that historic feel to it and echoes the old Peterson&apos;s ice cream parlor to me, the furniture is in desperate need of an overhaul. The seats seem dirty and sticky. One of the members in my party had no fluff or spring in his cushion, so he sat down and just sank into the seat. Not the best image to present. 

In terms of the food, the menu could use some clarity. The ice cream sundaes are solid but the menu doesn&apos;t do the best job of explaining them. I ordered a sundae that came with raspberries but no hot fudge...doesn&apos;t sound like a sundae to me! I went with banana ice cream but it had a weird artificial taste to it. I&apos;ll just go with vanilla the next time. The whipped cream is good and the presentation of the sundae is wonderful. I love the conch bowls and the little pitchers for the topping. My raspberry topping was too tart for my liking. I&apos;m a hot fudge connoisseur and their take on hot fudge just didn&apos;t work for me. It tasted like melted baking chocolate and butter--way to rich and tummy-ache inducing for me. 

As a heads up, service is SLOW and there is a line if you want to sit down and order."
4,"The not-so-good: Crowded store, kind of brusque service, questionable bathrooms.

The good: OMG massive VATS of ice cream with gravy boats of hot fudge!!!

I don&apos;t remember exactly what we ordered, but the two sundaes we ordered were lacquered with caramel and nuts and whipped cream. The ice cream itself was fantastic. We customized our sundaes with a bunch of different flavors -- chocolate chip, coffee, praline, chocolate, and cheesecake. Surprisingly, the cheesecake was the best. One of the sundaes come with a homemade turtle, which was amazing.

Serving sizes were insane. A two-scoop sundae is more than enough for two people!"
3,"DEFINITELY NOT THE PLACE TO GO IF YOU ARE BRINGING YOUR FAMILY!!  THE REASON, VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE, ESPECIALLY SINCE COVIT, YOU HAVE TO FIGURE AT LEAST $13 TO $20 PER PERSON---meaning by the time you order just ice cream, you will spend at least $50 for 4 and not even eat!.  see i live in the neighborhood (bucktown) and i always would go there and get a small one scoop strawberry sundae, which they would normally put in a nice rectangle box with the bottom full of the one scoop, whip cream strawberries and a cherry...and it was about five bucks, now for SEVEN BUCKS, you get a smaller scoop, three strawberries, some whip cream, enough nuts that you can actually count each and every one of them, and one half of a cherry!!  and they ring it up on an old banger cash register that does not even record the sale!!  (skimming??--that&apos;s between them and the irs, but i&apos;m sure it is rampant!!)  

now imagine ordering a regular sundae, about three bucks more, or one of their &quot;creations&quot;, you will easily get to at least 15 per person, so know that before you come here, and you&apos;ll be ok.  (BY THE WAY, THE FREEZE ON ARMITAGE AND CALIFORNIA IS A MUCH BETTER DEAL WHEN THEY OPEN IN THE SPRING--AND JUST AS GOOD).  

I LOVE ICE CREAM, i&apos;ve been to them all (rainbow, homer&apos;s, gerties, etc...even the old zephyr and lockwood castle), margies ice cream is good, but deninitely not a seven dollar small sundae good....the butter fat and process is just not there.  maybe they&apos;re taking advantage of covid, i&apos;m sure they are, and now instead of me being a 20 time + per year customer, they will get me once or twice after this one, and that will be only when i am desperate for ice cream and don&apos;t feel like going elsewhere.

and so you know, yes, the dining room when open still has that 1950&apos;s vibe, but all the seating is tight and i don&apos;t think it has been updated or repaired since installation, and the bathroom is a hot tight mess.  i don&apos;t know how the city lets them get away with one bathroom for their seating.  i think they do more in the way of cleaning other than wiping the tables, but i&apos;m not sure as i&apos;ve never seen it.

good luck, go elsewhere"
5,OMG! If you looking for dessert as a dinner go here! The portions are very large and everything is delicious! My personal favorite is BROWNIE ALA MODE.. Yum! Be ready for a wait on the weekends and summer nights as it is a quite popular spot. The wait is worth it though.
5,"Margie&apos;s is a Chicago staple!  It has been around for 100 years and was packed on a Sunday night, in winter!  The staff is so sweet and efficient, and the ice cream is out of this world.  The menu is HUGE with endless ice cream and sundae options.  

I got the waffle cone sundae with chocolate ice cream, which was classic.  The &quot;brownie a la mode&quot; is hands down the best thing on the menu, though, so much bang for your buck!

Special shoutout to the man clearing the tables, he was so sweet and attentive and definitely got lots of tips from us :)"
5,This place has been around forever... and the inside decor hasn&apos;t changed!  But the ice cream and taffy apples are fresh! There&apos;s usually a little bit of a wait unless you get there later in the evening then the wait times are ridiculous. This place is a definite must for some great ice cream!!

Turtle Sundae - $7.95 - Got Vanilla and Pistachio. Ice cream tasted like the stuff you get from Thrifty. Scoops were decent sized. Comes with sauce and a wafer cookie. 

Cool place to try if you want to step back in time but ice cream was nothing special and a bit overpriced."
3,This is the original location (there&apos;s another one on Montrose) and both locations are so small &amp; crowded inside. Not too much table seating options. We waited for quite some time for a table &amp; the lady who served us was quite rude and didn&apos;t seem like she enjoyed her job.. it was a Sunday night but yet it was house packed. The portions are huge and price is reasonable. But don&apos;t think I&apos;d wanna come back. I used to go to the Montrose location all the time so maybe I&apos;ll stick with that location . The ice cream is good but it isn&apos;t THAT good. Also the place doesn&apos;t seem like it&apos;s the cleanest place either.
5,"I mean I truly have no complaints about Margie&apos;s ! Got seated right away, service was so quick and the ice cream was AWESOME ! What makes this place so unique and nostalgic is how it&apos;s been in Chicago since the 20&apos;s which is just so beyond amazing ! Someone opened for that long deserved foodies like us to go check it out ! 
We got the brownie a la mode ! 
TIP: you can adjust it the way you like it which is awesome ! 
Removed the nuts and added cookie and cream ice cream (instead of doing plain vanilla or chocolate) 
Great decision !! I loved it so much ! It hit the spot after a whole day in Chicago !
Don&apos;t forget the homemade fudge they make ! Drool worthy and makes whatever you get just 50x better !"
3,"This ice cream sundae shop has some fun Chicago lore--the cherry on top being the Beatles&apos; visit to the location back in the 60s. While the place still has that historic feel to it and echoes the old Peterson&apos;s ice cream parlor to me, the furniture is in desperate need of an overhaul. The seats seem dirty and sticky. One of the members in my party had no fluff or spring in his cushion, so he sat down and just sank into the seat. Not the best image to present. 

In terms of the food, the menu could use some clarity. The ice cream sundaes are solid but the menu doesn&apos;t do the best job of explaining them. I ordered a sundae that came with raspberries but no hot fudge...doesn&apos;t sound like a sundae to me! I went with banana ice cream but it had a weird artificial taste to it. I&apos;ll just go with vanilla the next time. The whipped cream is good and the presentation of the sundae is wonderful. I love the conch bowls and the little pitchers for the topping. My raspberry topping was too tart for my liking. I&apos;m a hot fudge connoisseur and their take on hot fudge just didn&apos;t work for me. It tasted like melted baking chocolate and butter--way to rich and tummy-ache inducing for me. 

As a heads up, service is SLOW and there is a line if you want to sit down and order."
4,"The not-so-good: Crowded store, kind of brusque service, questionable bathrooms.

The good: OMG massive VATS of ice cream with gravy boats of hot fudge!!!

I don&apos;t remember exactly what we ordered, but the two sundaes we ordered were lacquered with caramel and nuts and whipped cream. The ice cream itself was fantastic. We customized our sundaes with a bunch of different flavors -- chocolate chip, coffee, praline, chocolate, and cheesecake. Surprisingly, the cheesecake was the best. One of the sundaes come with a homemade turtle, which was amazing.

Serving sizes were insane. A two-scoop sundae is more than enough for two people!"
3,"DEFINITELY NOT THE PLACE TO GO IF YOU ARE BRINGING YOUR FAMILY!!  THE REASON, VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE, ESPECIALLY SINCE COVIT, YOU HAVE TO FIGURE AT LEAST $13 TO $20 PER PERSON---meaning by the time you order just ice cream, you will spend at least $50 for 4 and not even eat!.  see i live in the neighborhood (bucktown) and i always would go there and get a small one scoop strawberry sundae, which they would normally put in a nice rectangle box with the bottom full of the one scoop, whip cream strawberries and a cherry...and it was about five bucks, now for SEVEN BUCKS, you get a smaller scoop, three strawberries, some whip cream, enough nuts that you can actually count each and every one of them, and one half of a cherry!!  and they ring it up on an old banger cash register that does not even record the sale!!  (skimming??--that&apos;s between them and the irs, but i&apos;m sure it is rampant!!)  

now imagine ordering a regular sundae, about three bucks more, or one of their &quot;creations&quot;, you will easily get to at least 15 per person, so know that before you come here, and you&apos;ll be ok.  (BY THE WAY, THE FREEZE ON ARMITAGE AND CALIFORNIA IS A MUCH BETTER DEAL WHEN THEY OPEN IN THE SPRING--AND JUST AS GOOD).  

I LOVE ICE CREAM, i&apos;ve been to them all (rainbow, homer&apos;s, gerties, etc...even the old zephyr and lockwood castle), margies ice cream is good, but deninitely not a seven dollar small sundae good....the butter fat and process is just not there.  maybe they&apos;re taking advantage of covid, i&apos;m sure they are, and now instead of me being a 20 time + per year customer, they will get me once or twice after this one, and that will be only when i am desperate for ice cream and don&apos;t feel like going elsewhere.

and so you know, yes, the dining room when open still has that 1950&apos;s vibe, but all the seating is tight and i don&apos;t think it has been updated or repaired since installation, and the bathroom is a hot tight mess.  i don&apos;t know how the city lets them get away with one bathroom for their seating.  i think they do more in the way of cleaning other than wiping the tables, but i&apos;m not sure as i&apos;ve never seen it.

good luck, go elsewhere"
5,OMG! If you looking for dessert as a dinner go here! The portions are very large and everything is delicious! My personal favorite is BROWNIE ALA MODE.. Yum! Be ready for a wait on the weekends and summer nights as it is a quite popular spot. The wait is worth it though.
5,"Margie&apos;s is a Chicago staple!  It has been around for 100 years and was packed on a Sunday night, in winter!  The staff is so sweet and efficient, and the ice cream is out of this world.  The menu is HUGE with endless ice cream and sundae options.  

I got the waffle cone sundae with chocolate ice cream, which was classic.  The &quot;brownie a la mode&quot; is hands down the best thing on the menu, though, so much bang for your buck!

Special shoutout to the man clearing the tables, he was so sweet and attentive and definitely got lots of tips from us :)"
5,This place has been around forever... and the inside decor hasn&apos;t changed!  But the ice cream and taffy apples are fresh! There&apos;s usually a little bit of a wait unless you get there later in the evening then the wait times are ridiculous. This place is a definite must for some great ice cream!!
5,"Ice cream
I whend whit my bf
This time but i bring family  &amp; friends are well
We order banana split butter scotch 
3 balls of ice cream
Pretty good"
5,"Even though this place has been around forever, I was finally able to try it for the first time and it really lived up to the hype! We had to wait for 20-30 minutes or so before we were seated but it was so worth it. The sundae is sooo good and my favorite part is that they give you hot fudge and caramel sauces on the side that you can pour onto the ice cream yourself. Makes it such a fun experiences! Their sundaes are also huge so definitely great to share."
5,"Enough to share!! I got a two scoop Sunday and shared with my brother, we didn&apos;t even finish it. I definitely recommend sharing these beasts. The restaurant itself carries a few sandwiches and light lunch options but I think we all know the desserts are the highlight. 

The Sunday we had was delicious! Covered in whipped cream, hot fudge to pour, and wafers to dip. So fun and a tasty treat. The menu offers many flavors combinations in terms of ice cream flavors and toppings. Overwhelming in the best way. Everything tastes fresh and looked pleasant, which in my opinion is important with dessert."
5,Simply incredible I love coming here. Anyone who has not tried it needs to.What more can I say.
4,"Okay, now THIS is Chicago, am I right? Everybody who&apos;s been living here for a while has at least seen or heard of this shoppe before. One of the oldest eatery in the city, most famous for their delicious assortment of ice cream and chocolates. Once you walk in the establishment, it feels like you&apos;re walking into a time capsule, back into the past century, with old timey photos of Margie&apos;s upbringings along with miscellaneous tools and toys from the early 20th century; this is almost like a little museum with amazing ice cream!

Now I&apos;m not a huge fan of ice cream but I&apos;ll have it at times when I&apos;m in the mood for it, so I had something basic, two scoops of ice cream with Margie&apos;s signature fudge and a little turtle. It certainly hit the spot on a hot summer night, and I could definitely see the appeal as the restaurant is fit for all types of crowds. Thing is, if you&apos;re dining in, prepare to wait a while to get your order in. This place always seems to be crowded, especially at night. Still worth the trip! Ice cream fan or not!"
5,"Chicago Classic!!
Whether you&apos;re visiting or from the Windy City. Margie&apos;s is the go-to for ice cream sundaes and fudge! They are pretty much opened everyday of the year except major holidays or severe weather. Sitting is limited/tight but you instantly get a flashback to the beginning days with the old school decor and jukeboxes on the tables(don&apos;t work, I&apos;ve always tried lbvs). Service is always quick and with a great attitude despite the flow of people going in and out. They have over 30+ variations and flavors so trust me what you&apos;re looking for has to be here. They also serve soup/sandwich/salad specials in case you wanted to snack before your dessert. Parking is available around the corner, so you might have to take a small walk but totally worth it. (:"
5,"This was my first time coming here. Everyone would say it was an amazing place. I finally tried it after so long and let me tell you..... it&apos;s AMAZING!! I love sweets, the ice cream isn&apos;t as bad as like some how they just fill you up and u feel sick after. I got a Hot Caramel banana split. They give u a perfect sizing for it nothing over the top!! You can choose your own ice cream. Recommend coming here if you&apos;re from Chicago or just visiting"
4,"Staple for desserts. Got takeout here on a Saturday evening. Giggles suggest takeout over waiting in line for a table, it&apos;s always crowded. Banana split will strawberry, vanilla, and pecan ice cream. Ice cream was very good, wafer on the split was a nice touch. Dessert was a very large portion, plenty to share. One of the better places to visit in the city for ice cream sundaes."
4,"This place is probably amazing on a summer Friday or Saturday night in a non-COVID world.  Go here with your date and get some ice cream to share.  Hell yeah!

In COVID times, it&apos;s not quite as good.  No seating, of course, and a very small selection of candies.  The ice cream, and especially the milkshakes, are just as good, however!  And the staff could not be nicer.  Good prices as well."
5,"Do yourself a favor and get the Bucktown Sundae - 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream, fudge, marshmallow, banana, whipped cream, nuts, and a cherry. Plenty for two people. Yummmm!!!"
5,"Certain places in Chicago you must see. The Bean, Millennium Park, the Zoo, Botanical Gardens, get Tavern style pizza (real Chicago style) and go to Margie&apos;s for ice cream. This is an absolutely iconic institution and you won&apos;t regret coming here at all. I love the western avenue location, I believe it&apos;s the original. 

Located right off western avenue, there is easy expressway access and tons of street parking. You can also use the lot at Lazos Tacos which is across the street. The employee are all very friendly and a lot of them have been there for a long time. If you plan on eating there, it may be crowded to get a table, but we usually get ours to go. 

Now the ice cream... WOW. Come here hungry because the portions here are huge. Shakes, sundaes, malts, they legit have everything. The sundaes come in almost mixing bowl size bowls and you could easily share one. I&apos;m preferential to the Royal fudge shake. Basically an awesome chocolate shake and has a banana. Seriously one of the best shakes you&apos;ll have. Prices are good considering how much you get and how good it is. 

Take the drive and get yourself an ice cream treat."

and so you know, yes, the dining room when open still has that 1950&apos;s vibe, but all the seating is tight and i don&apos;t think it has been updated or repaired since installation, and the bathroom is a hot tight mess.  i don&apos;t know how the city lets them get away with one bathroom for their seating.  i think they do more in the way of cleaning other than wiping the tables, but i&apos;m not sure as i&apos;ve never seen it.

good luck, go elsewhere"
5,OMG! If you looking for dessert as a dinner go here! The portions are very large and everything is delicious! My personal favorite is BROWNIE ALA MODE.. Yum! Be ready for a wait on the weekends and summer nights as it is a quite popular spot. The wait is worth it though.
5,"Margie&apos;s is a Chicago staple!  It has been around for 100 years and was packed on a Sunday night, in winter!  The staff is so sweet and efficient, and the ice cream is out of this world.  The menu is HUGE with endless ice cream and sundae options.  

I got the waffle cone sundae with chocolate ice cream, which was classic.  The &quot;brownie a la mode&quot; is hands down the best thing on the menu, though, so much bang for your buck!

Special shoutout to the man clearing the tables, he was so sweet and attentive and definitely got lots of tips from us :)"
5,This place has been around forever... and the inside decor hasn&apos;t changed!  But the ice cream and taffy apples are fresh! There&apos;s usually a little bit of a wait unless you get there later in the evening then the wait times are ridiculous. This place is a definite must for some great ice cream!!
5,"Ice cream
I whend whit my bf
This time but i bring family  &amp; friends are well
We order banana split butter scotch 
3 balls of ice cream
Pretty good"
5,"Even though this place has been around forever, I was finally able to try it for the first time and it really lived up to the hype! We had to wait for 20-30 minutes or so before we were seated but it was so worth it. The sundae is sooo good and my favorite part is that they give you hot fudge and caramel sauces on the side that you can pour onto the ice cream yourself. Makes it such a fun experiences! Their sundaes are also huge so definitely great to share."
5,"Enough to share!! I got a two scoop Sunday and shared with my brother, we didn&apos;t even finish it. I definitely recommend sharing these beasts. The restaurant itself carries a few sandwiches and light lunch options but I think we all know the desserts are the highlight. 

The Sunday we had was delicious! Covered in whipped cream, hot fudge to pour, and wafers to dip. So fun and a tasty treat. The menu offers many flavors combinations in terms of ice cream flavors and toppings. Overwhelming in the best way. Everything tastes fresh and looked pleasant, which in my opinion is important with dessert."
5,Simply incredible I love coming here. Anyone who has not tried it needs to.What more can I say.
4,"Okay, now THIS is Chicago, am I right? Everybody who&apos;s been living here for a while has at least seen or heard of this shoppe before. One of the oldest eatery in the city, most famous for their delicious assortment of ice cream and chocolates. Once you walk in the establishment, it feels like you&apos;re walking into a time capsule, back into the past century, with old timey photos of Margie&apos;s upbringings along with miscellaneous tools and toys from the early 20th century; this is almost like a little museum with amazing ice cream!

Now I&apos;m not a huge fan of ice cream but I&apos;ll have it at times when I&apos;m in the mood for it, so I had something basic, two scoops of ice cream with Margie&apos;s signature fudge and a little turtle. It certainly hit the spot on a hot summer night, and I could definitely see the appeal as the restaurant is fit for all types of crowds. Thing is, if you&apos;re dining in, prepare to wait a while to get your order in. This place always seems to be crowded, especially at night. Still worth the trip! Ice cream fan or not!"
5,"Chicago Classic!!
Whether you&apos;re visiting or from the Windy City. Margie&apos;s is the go-to for ice cream sundaes and fudge! They are pretty much opened everyday of the year except major holidays or severe weather. Sitting is limited/tight but you instantly get a flashback to the beginning days with the old school decor and jukeboxes on the tables(don&apos;t work, I&apos;ve always tried lbvs). Service is always quick and with a great attitude despite the flow of people going in and out. They have over 30+ variations and flavors so trust me what you&apos;re looking for has to be here. They also serve soup/sandwich/salad specials in case you wanted to snack before your dessert. Parking is available around the corner, so you might have to take a small walk but totally worth it. (:"
5,"This was my first time coming here. Everyone would say it was an amazing place. I finally tried it after so long and let me tell you..... it&apos;s AMAZING!! I love sweets, the ice cream isn&apos;t as bad as like some how they just fill you up and u feel sick after. I got a Hot Caramel banana split. They give u a perfect sizing for it nothing over the top!! You can choose your own ice cream. Recommend coming here if you&apos;re from Chicago or just visiting"
4,"Staple for desserts. Got takeout here on a Saturday evening. Giggles suggest takeout over waiting in line for a table, it&apos;s always crowded. Banana split will strawberry, vanilla, and pecan ice cream. Ice cream was very good, wafer on the split was a nice touch. Dessert was a very large portion, plenty to share. One of the better places to visit in the city for ice cream sundaes."
4,"This place is probably amazing on a summer Friday or Saturday night in a non-COVID world.  Go here with your date and get some ice cream to share.  Hell yeah!

In COVID times, it&apos;s not quite as good.  No seating, of course, and a very small selection of candies.  The ice cream, and especially the milkshakes, are just as good, however!  And the staff could not be nicer.  Good prices as well."
5,"Do yourself a favor and get the Bucktown Sundae - 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream, fudge, marshmallow, banana, whipped cream, nuts, and a cherry. Plenty for two people. Yummmm!!!"
5,"Certain places in Chicago you must see. The Bean, Millennium Park, the Zoo, Botanical Gardens, get Tavern style pizza (real Chicago style) and go to Margie&apos;s for ice cream. This is an absolutely iconic institution and you won&apos;t regret coming here at all. I love the western avenue location, I believe it&apos;s the original. 

Located right off western avenue, there is easy expressway access and tons of street parking. You can also use the lot at Lazos Tacos which is across the street. The employee are all very friendly and a lot of them have been there for a long time. If you plan on eating there, it may be crowded to get a table, but we usually get ours to go. 

Now the ice cream... WOW. Come here hungry because the portions here are huge. Shakes, sundaes, malts, they legit have everything. The sundaes come in almost mixing bowl size bowls and you could easily share one. I&apos;m preferential to the Royal fudge shake. Basically an awesome chocolate shake and has a banana. Seriously one of the best shakes you&apos;ll have. Prices are good considering how much you get and how good it is. 

Take the drive and get yourself an ice cream treat."
3,"Margie&apos;s is a throwback ice cream joint. 

Inside looks like it has not been redone since they opened.

I love the og registers at the tables.

Service was good, order came out fast. 

Turtle Sundae - $7.95 - Got Vanilla and Pistachio. Ice cream tasted like the stuff you get from Thrifty. Scoops were decent sized. Comes with sauce and a wafer cookie. 

Cool place to try if you want to step back in time but ice cream was nothing special and a bit overpriced."
3,This is the original location (there&apos;s another one on Montrose) and both locations are so small &amp; crowded inside. Not too much table seating options. We waited for quite some time for a table &amp; the lady who served us was quite rude and didn&apos;t seem like she enjoyed her job.. it was a Sunday night but yet it was house packed. The portions are huge and price is reasonable. But don&apos;t think I&apos;d wanna come back. I used to go to the Montrose location all the time so maybe I&apos;ll stick with that location . The ice cream is good but it isn&apos;t THAT good. Also the place doesn&apos;t seem like it&apos;s the cleanest place either.
5,"I mean I truly have no complaints about Margie&apos;s ! Got seated right away, service was so quick and the ice cream was AWESOME ! What makes this place so unique and nostalgic is how it&apos;s been in Chicago since the 20&apos;s which is just so beyond amazing ! Someone opened for that long deserved foodies like us to go check it out ! 
We got the brownie a la mode ! 
TIP: you can adjust it the way you like it which is awesome ! 
Removed the nuts and added cookie and cream ice cream (instead of doing plain vanilla or chocolate) 
Great decision !! I loved it so much ! It hit the spot after a whole day in Chicago !
Don&apos;t forget the homemade fudge they make ! Drool worthy and makes whatever you get just 50x better !"
3,"This ice cream sundae shop has some fun Chicago lore--the cherry on top being the Beatles&apos; visit to the location back in the 60s. While the place still has that historic feel to it and echoes the old Peterson&apos;s ice cream parlor to me, the furniture is in desperate need of an overhaul. The seats seem dirty and sticky. One of the members in my party had no fluff or spring in his cushion, so he sat down and just sank into the seat. Not the best image to present. 

In terms of the food, the menu could use some clarity. The ice cream sundaes are solid but the menu doesn&apos;t do the best job of explaining them. I ordered a sundae that came with raspberries but no hot fudge...doesn&apos;t sound like a sundae to me! I went with banana ice cream but it had a weird artificial taste to it. I&apos;ll just go with vanilla the next time. The whipped cream is good and the presentation of the sundae is wonderful. I love the conch bowls and the little pitchers for the topping. My raspberry topping was too tart for my liking. I&apos;m a hot fudge connoisseur and their take on hot fudge just didn&apos;t work for me. It tasted like melted baking chocolate and butter--way to rich and tummy-ache inducing for me. 

As a heads up, service is SLOW and there is a line if you want to sit down and order."
4,"The not-so-good: Crowded store, kind of brusque service, questionable bathrooms.

The good: OMG massive VATS of ice cream with gravy boats of hot fudge!!!

I don&apos;t remember exactly what we ordered, but the two sundaes we ordered were lacquered with caramel and nuts and whipped cream. The ice cream itself was fantastic. We customized our sundaes with a bunch of different flavors -- chocolate chip, coffee, praline, chocolate, and cheesecake. Surprisingly, the cheesecake was the best. One of the sundaes come with a homemade turtle, which was amazing.

Serving sizes were insane. A two-scoop sundae is more than enough for two people!"
3,"DEFINITELY NOT THE PLACE TO GO IF YOU ARE BRINGING YOUR FAMILY!!  THE REASON, VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE, ESPECIALLY SINCE COVIT, YOU HAVE TO FIGURE AT LEAST $13 TO $20 PER PERSON---meaning by the time you order just ice cream, you will spend at least $50 for 4 and not even eat!.  see i live in the neighborhood (bucktown) and i always would go there and get a small one scoop strawberry sundae, which they would normally put in a nice rectangle box with the bottom full of the one scoop, whip cream strawberries and a cherry...and it was about five bucks, now for SEVEN BUCKS, you get a smaller scoop, three strawberries, some whip cream, enough nuts that you can actually count each and every one of them, and one half of a cherry!!  and they ring it up on an old banger cash register that does not even record the sale!!  (skimming??--that&apos;s between them and the irs, but i&apos;m sure it is rampant!!)  

now imagine ordering a regular sundae, about three bucks more, or one of their &quot;creations&quot;, you will easily get to at least 15 per person, so know that before you come here, and you&apos;ll be ok.  (BY THE WAY, THE FREEZE ON ARMITAGE AND CALIFORNIA IS A MUCH BETTER DEAL WHEN THEY OPEN IN THE SPRING--AND JUST AS GOOD).  

I LOVE ICE CREAM, i&apos;ve been to them all (rainbow, homer&apos;s, gerties, etc...even the old zephyr and lockwood castle), margies ice cream is good, but deninitely not a seven dollar small sundae good....the butter fat and process is just not there.  maybe they&apos;re taking advantage of covid, i&apos;m sure they are, and now instead of me being a 20 time + per year customer, they will get me once or twice after this one, and that will be only when i am desperate for ice cream and don&apos;t feel like going elsewhere.

They give u a perfect sizing for it nothing over the top!! You can choose your own ice cream. Recommend coming here if you&apos;re from Chicago or just visiting"
4,"Staple for desserts. Got takeout here on a Saturday evening. Giggles suggest takeout over waiting in line for a table, it&apos;s always crowded. Banana split will strawberry, vanilla, and pecan ice cream. Ice cream was very good, wafer on the split was a nice touch. Dessert was a very large portion, plenty to share. One of the better places to visit in the city for ice cream sundaes."
4,"This place is probably amazing on a summer Friday or Saturday night in a non-COVID world.  Go here with your date and get some ice cream to share.  Hell yeah!

In COVID times, it&apos;s not quite as good.  No seating, of course, and a very small selection of candies.  The ice cream, and especially the milkshakes, are just as good, however!  And the staff could not be nicer.  Good prices as well."
5,"Do yourself a favor and get the Bucktown Sundae - 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream, fudge, marshmallow, banana, whipped cream, nuts, and a cherry. Plenty for two people. Yummmm!!!"
5,"Certain places in Chicago you must see. The Bean, Millennium Park, the Zoo, Botanical Gardens, get Tavern style pizza (real Chicago style) and go to Margie&apos;s for ice cream. This is an absolutely iconic institution and you won&apos;t regret coming here at all. I love the western avenue location, I believe it&apos;s the original. 

Located right off western avenue, there is easy expressway access and tons of street parking. You can also use the lot at Lazos Tacos which is across the street. The employee are all very friendly and a lot of them have been there for a long time. If you plan on eating there, it may be crowded to get a table, but we usually get ours to go. 

Now the ice cream... WOW. Come here hungry because the portions here are huge. Shakes, sundaes, malts, they legit have everything. The sundaes come in almost mixing bowl size bowls and you could easily share one. I&apos;m preferential to the Royal fudge shake. Basically an awesome chocolate shake and has a banana. Seriously one of the best shakes you&apos;ll have. Prices are good considering how much you get and how good it is. 

Take the drive and get yourself an ice cream treat."
3,"Margie&apos;s is a throwback ice cream joint. 

Inside looks like it has not been redone since they opened.

I love the og registers at the tables.

Service was good, order came out fast. 

Turtle Sundae - $7.95 - Got Vanilla and Pistachio. Ice cream tasted like the stuff you get from Thrifty. Scoops were decent sized. Comes with sauce and a wafer cookie. 

Cool place to try if you want to step back in time but ice cream was nothing special and a bit overpriced."
3,This is the original location (there&apos;s another one on Montrose) and both locations are so small &amp; crowded inside. Not too much table seating options. We waited for quite some time for a table &amp; the lady who served us was quite rude and didn&apos;t seem like she enjoyed her job.. it was a Sunday night but yet it was house packed. The portions are huge and price is reasonable. But don&apos;t think I&apos;d wanna come back. I used to go to the Montrose location all the time so maybe I&apos;ll stick with that location . The ice cream is good but it isn&apos;t THAT good. Also the place doesn&apos;t seem like it&apos;s the cleanest place either.
5,"I mean I truly have no complaints about Margie&apos;s ! Got seated right away, service was so quick and the ice cream was AWESOME ! What makes this place so unique and nostalgic is how it&apos;s been in Chicago since the 20&apos;s which is just so beyond amazing ! Someone opened for that long deserved foodies like us to go check it out ! 
We got the brownie a la mode ! 
TIP: you can adjust it the way you like it which is awesome ! 
Removed the nuts and added cookie and cream ice cream (instead of doing plain vanilla or chocolate) 
Great decision !! I loved it so much ! It hit the spot after a whole day in Chicago !
Don&apos;t forget the homemade fudge they make ! Drool worthy and makes whatever you get just 50x better !"
3,"This ice cream sundae shop has some fun Chicago lore--the cherry on top being the Beatles&apos; visit to the location back in the 60s. While the place still has that historic feel to it and echoes the old Peterson&apos;s ice cream parlor to me, the furniture is in desperate need of an overhaul. The seats seem dirty and sticky. One of the members in my party had no fluff or spring in his cushion, so he sat down and just sank into the seat. Not the best image to present. 

In terms of the food, the menu could use some clarity. The ice cream sundaes are solid but the menu doesn&apos;t do the best job of explaining them. I ordered a sundae that came with raspberries but no hot fudge...doesn&apos;t sound like a sundae to me! I went with banana ice cream but it had a weird artificial taste to it. I&apos;ll just go with vanilla the next time. The whipped cream is good and the presentation of the sundae is wonderful. I love the conch bowls and the little pitchers for the topping. My raspberry topping was too tart for my liking. I&apos;m a hot fudge connoisseur and their take on hot fudge just didn&apos;t work for me. It tasted like melted baking chocolate and butter--way to rich and tummy-ache inducing for me. 

As a heads up, service is SLOW and there is a line if you want to sit down and order."
4,"The not-so-good: Crowded store, kind of brusque service, questionable bathrooms.

The good: OMG massive VATS of ice cream with gravy boats of hot fudge!!!

I don&apos;t remember exactly what we ordered, but the two sundaes we ordered were lacquered with caramel and nuts and whipped cream. The ice cream itself was fantastic. We customized our sundaes with a bunch of different flavors -- chocolate chip, coffee, praline, chocolate, and cheesecake. Surprisingly, the cheesecake was the best. One of the sundaes come with a homemade turtle, which was amazing.

Serving sizes were insane. A two-scoop sundae is more than enough for two people!"
3,"DEFINITELY NOT THE PLACE TO GO IF YOU ARE BRINGING YOUR FAMILY!!  THE REASON, VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE, ESPECIALLY SINCE COVIT, YOU HAVE TO FIGURE AT LEAST $13 TO $20 PER PERSON---meaning by the time you order just ice cream, you will spend at least $50 for 4 and not even eat!.  see i live in the neighborhood (bucktown) and i always would go there and get a small one scoop strawberry sundae, which they would normally put in a nice rectangle box with the bottom full of the one scoop, whip cream strawberries and a cherry...and it was about five bucks, now for SEVEN BUCKS, you get a smaller scoop, three strawberries, some whip cream, enough nuts that you can actually count each and every one of them, and one half of a cherry!!  and they ring it up on an old banger cash register that does not even record the sale!!  (skimming??--that&apos;s between them and the irs, but i&apos;m sure it is rampant!!)  

now imagine ordering a regular sundae, about three bucks more, or one of their &quot;creations&quot;, you will easily get to at least 15 per person, so know that before you come here, and you&apos;ll be ok.  (BY THE WAY, THE FREEZE ON ARMITAGE AND CALIFORNIA IS A MUCH BETTER DEAL WHEN THEY OPEN IN THE SPRING--AND JUST AS GOOD).  

I LOVE ICE CREAM, i&apos;ve been to them all (rainbow, homer&apos;s, gerties, etc...even the old zephyr and lockwood castle), margies ice cream is good, but deninitely not a seven dollar small sundae good....the butter fat and process is just not there.  maybe they&apos;re taking advantage of covid, i&apos;m sure they are, and now instead of me being a 20 time + per year customer, they will get me once or twice after this one, and that will be only when i am desperate for ice cream and don&apos;t feel like going elsewhere.

and so you know, yes, the dining room when open still has that 1950&apos;s vibe, but all the seating is tight and i don&apos;t think it has been updated or repaired since installation, and the bathroom is a hot tight mess.  i don&apos;t know how the city lets them get away with one bathroom for their seating.  i think they do more in the way of cleaning other than wiping the tables, but i&apos;m not sure as i&apos;ve never seen it.

good luck, go elsewhere"
5,OMG! If you looking for dessert as a dinner go here! The portions are very large and everything is delicious! My personal favorite is BROWNIE ALA MODE.. Yum! Be ready for a wait on the weekends and summer nights as it is a quite popular spot. The wait is worth it though.
5,"Margie&apos;s is a Chicago staple!  It has been around for 100 years and was packed on a Sunday night, in winter!  The staff is so sweet and efficient, and the ice cream is out of this world.  The menu is HUGE with endless ice cream and sundae options.  

I got the waffle cone sundae with chocolate ice cream, which was classic.  The &quot;brownie a la mode&quot; is hands down the best thing on the menu, though, so much bang for your buck!

Special shoutout to the man clearing the tables, he was so sweet and attentive and definitely got lots of tips from us :)"
5,This place has been around forever... and the inside decor hasn&apos;t changed!  But the ice cream and taffy apples are fresh! There&apos;s usually a little bit of a wait unless you get there later in the evening then the wait times are ridiculous. This place is a definite must for some great ice cream!!
5,"Ice cream
I whend whit my bf
This time but i bring family  &amp; friends are well
We order banana split butter scotch 
3 balls of ice cream
Pretty good"
5,"Even though this place has been around forever, I was finally able to try it for the first time and it really lived up to the hype! We had to wait for 20-30 minutes or so before we were seated but it was so worth it. The sundae is sooo good and my favorite part is that they give you hot fudge and caramel sauces on the side that you can pour onto the ice cream yourself. Makes it such a fun experiences! Their sundaes are also huge so definitely great to share."
5,"Enough to share!! I got a two scoop Sunday and shared with my brother, we didn&apos;t even finish it. I definitely recommend sharing these beasts. The restaurant itself carries a few sandwiches and light lunch options but I think we all know the desserts are the highlight. 

The Sunday we had was delicious! Covered in whipped cream, hot fudge to pour, and wafers to dip. So fun and a tasty treat. The menu offers many flavors combinations in terms of ice cream flavors and toppings. Overwhelming in the best way. Everything tastes fresh and looked pleasant, which in my opinion is important with dessert."
5,Simply incredible I love coming here. Anyone who has not tried it needs to.What more can I say.
4,"Okay, now THIS is Chicago, am I right? Everybody who&apos;s been living here for a while has at least seen or heard of this shoppe before. One of the oldest eatery in the city, most famous for their delicious assortment of ice cream and chocolates. Once you walk in the establishment, it feels like you&apos;re walking into a time capsule, back into the past century, with old timey photos of Margie&apos;s upbringings along with miscellaneous tools and toys from the early 20th century; this is almost like a little museum with amazing ice cream!

Now I&apos;m not a huge fan of ice cream but I&apos;ll have it at times when I&apos;m in the mood for it, so I had something basic, two scoops of ice cream with Margie&apos;s signature fudge and a little turtle. It certainly hit the spot on a hot summer night, and I could definitely see the appeal as the restaurant is fit for all types of crowds. Thing is, if you&apos;re dining in, prepare to wait a while to get your order in. This place always seems to be crowded, especially at night. Still worth the trip! Ice cream fan or not!"
5,"Chicago Classic!!
Whether you&apos;re visiting or from the Windy City. Margie&apos;s is the go-to for ice cream sundaes and fudge! They are pretty much opened everyday of the year except major holidays or severe weather. Sitting is limited/tight but you instantly get a flashback to the beginning days with the old school decor and jukeboxes on the tables(don&apos;t work, I&apos;ve always tried lbvs). Service is always quick and with a great attitude despite the flow of people going in and out. They have over 30+ variations and flavors so trust me what you&apos;re looking for has to be here. They also serve soup/sandwich/salad specials in case you wanted to snack before your dessert. Parking is available around the corner, so you might have to take a small walk but totally worth it. (:"
