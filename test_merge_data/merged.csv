5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago.

4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."
5,"love it

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!

Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."
5,"love it

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each).

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."
5,"love it

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."

5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in.

5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine!

The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."
5,"love it

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!

Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella.

The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."
5,"love it

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had.

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal.

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."
5,"love it

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli.

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."

Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing.

5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion

Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas.

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."
5,"love it

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!

Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella.

The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."
5,"love it

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person.

5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."

The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this.

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"
5,"&quot;Live your life without ever having to ask, &apos;What if?&quot;
~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"
5,"&quot;Live your life without ever having to ask, &apos;What if?&quot;
~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"

Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."

Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them.

I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"
5,"&quot;Live your life without ever having to ask, &apos;What if?&quot;
~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."

5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."

In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it.

Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet.

I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."
5,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. 
I definitely see Bavette&apos;s being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it&apos;s the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! 
Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. 
We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak &amp; frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. 
Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. 
Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I&apos;ve been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. 
Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) 
I can&apos;t wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!"
5,"We chose Bavette&apos;s to order takeout for my December birthday dinner at home during the COVID pandemic. Bavette&apos;s has been on my to-eat list for years because of the positive reviews I&apos;ve heard about the romantic ambiance and delicious food. I took a chance with takeout (skipping the ambiance), and I can happily report that the food 100% holds up on its own. I wholeheartedly recommend Bavette&apos;s! 

Our order: 

Truffle mac and cheese: we split this as an appetizer. The portion size was huge! Great truffle taste. Super rich. 

Fried chicken: my husband was very impressed with this dish. These are the creamiest mashed potatoes I&apos;ve ever tried. The portion size was HUGE. Four pieces of fried chicken! 

Crab cake: Since I don&apos;t eat meat, I opted for the crab cake for my main course. There were huge fresh chunks of crab. Absolutely one of the best crab cakes I&apos;ve had, and they were very generous with remoulade! So so good. 

Chocolate cream pie: WOW. I&apos;ve seen pictures of this on Instagram before, and they always looked so good that there was no way I wasn&apos;t order this. The chocolate cream pie is extremely decadent and is  officially one of my favorite desserts in Chicago. The whipped cream is also impressive and just..perfect. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering takeout (and dining in during normal times) at Bavette&apos;s!"
5,"Here&apos;s what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I&apos;m picking Bavette&apos;s. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there&apos;s something about Bavette&apos;s that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. 

Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you&apos;re looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette&apos;s up to the top of your list. And if you&apos;re looking to impress me? Invite me along! I&apos;m always ready."
4,"It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 

Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 

I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 

The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 

The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!

Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 

The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious."
5,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac &amp; cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha).

 All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.

The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago."
5,"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

The food was incredible at Bavette&apos;s! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
4,"Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  

Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there&apos;s 20 bucks gone on service fees."
5,"Starting with a disclaimer that it&apos;s probably been two years since I&apos;ve been to Bavette&apos;s, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine&apos;s Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette&apos;s a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
5,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. 

Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. 

Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac &amp; cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!

What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I&apos;ve had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. 

Oh, and don&apos;t forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife&apos;s extra birthday cake ;)"
5,"Bavette&apos;s is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. 

For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. 

For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"I&apos;ve been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it&apos;s so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward
To returning when restaurants reopen."
5,"The food is AMAZING.  
The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  

I can&apos;t wait for them to reopen."
2,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there&apos;s something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn&apos;t go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don&apos;t see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
5,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
5,"I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.

Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
2,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. 

Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn&apos;t go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn&apos;t spend $600 at this place."
5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"
5,"&quot;Live your life without ever having to ask, &apos;What if?&quot;
~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner.

5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan!

5,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!

We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own).

From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection.

This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"
5,"&quot;Live your life without ever having to ask, &apos;What if?&quot;
~Ken Poirot

-

That&apos;s what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn&apos;t have to ask myself that &quot;What if&quot; question.  And....

I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.

It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination.

The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.

If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!

It&apos;s sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined.

Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
5,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner. 

We had reservations to celebrate my birthday, and the entire front of the house staff were completely accommodating and welcoming. The service was impeccable, as our server was extremely knowledgeable of the menu and offered his pro tips in recommendations. 

Starters:
Beef tenderloin tartar 5/5
Extremely flavorful and pairs really well with their house made vinegar chips 

Sides:
Truffle Mac and cheese 5/5
YAAAAAS don&apos;t let anyone ever treat you like a side dish unless it&apos;s like their truffle Mac! 

Brussel stouts 5/5
Tender, flavorful, and simply delightful 

Entree 5/5
Honey Glazed Salmon 

Dessert 5/5 
Carrot cake (the best!!!)

I can&apos;t wait to return! 

Food 5/5
Decor 5/5
Service 5/5
Overall impression 5/5"
5,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection.

I&apos;ve been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I&apos;ve waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L&apos;Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more.

This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to.

Let&apos;s start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!

Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I&apos;m just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what&apos;s that? You&apos;ll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don&apos;t have anything better to do!

Oh hello there sir, yes I&apos;ll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I&apos;ve had in 5 years! Oh yes I&apos;ll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!

What&apos;s that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I&apos;m on my second cocktail and I&apos;ve forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality....

Oh! Yes I&apos;ll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.

As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I&apos;ve ever graced with my taste buds. 

At this point I&apos;m about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!


Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I&apos;m glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant.

Should you come? It&apos;s literally a shame if you don&apos;t. I&apos;m feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren&apos;t eating my meal...."

5,"On my 35th birthday I finally got to try The Purple Pig after all these years. Every time I&apos;ve gone in the past, I haven&apos;t had any luck because they usually don&apos;t take reservations and the wait was always so long; however, because of COVID-19, they are now taking reservations!

They definitely lived up to the hype after all these years and I was super happy with all the menu items we ordered. My favorite dish was the crispy pig ears with kale. It was like having elevated Chicharrón with crispy kale. The pickled banana peppers added the proper amount of acidity and the yolk from the fried egg soaked up all the flavors perfectly.

If you&apos;re looking for comfort food, the milk braise pork shoulder provided all of that. The gravy was mind blowing! Throw in some great cocktails and wine pairings and The Purple Pig is the perfect casual-chic restaurant for tourists and locals alike! You can&apos;t go wrong with any menu item here!"
5,"We came here to celebrate our anniversary. This place is known for long wait times and not allowing reservations. Not luckily, but luckily because of COVID, they are currently doing reservations. So we&apos;re able to walk in with our reservation and get a table right away. I will admit, this place was very casual and I felt like we were over dressed. They were very professional throughout the night and did really great explaining every dish and giving directions on how to eat the food so you can get the best taste out of each dish. Jimmy Bannos Jr. even stopped by our table to talk a little bit and made sure we were enjoying our night. 

We started off our night with a couple of drinks. My wife ordered their &quot;Paloma&quot; and I was feeling rich and magical that night and ordered their &quot;24 Carrot Magic.&quot; The Paloma was a simple classic made with Espolon blanco tequila, lime juice and grapefruit soda. It&apos;s really hard to get this one wrong. Definitely tasty. The 24 carrot Magic was something different. This one came with corazon reposado tequila, ancho Reyes Chile liqueur, carrot juice, lime juice and ginger syrup. A drink with a kick of heat, thanks to the ancho Reyes Chile liqueur. Never heard of such liqueur and is now on my list of things to buy! The carrot juice was overpower and made the drink taste healthy. I just wish they had the wider selection of drinks, the at least the drinks we both got were fantastic. 

We started off with their Crispy Pigs Ear and ended up with a total of four entries plus dessert. 

Crispy Pigs Ear-This seems to be a very popular dish. It&apos;s served with salty crispy pigs ear, mixed with kale, and pickled banana peppers and topped with a fried egg. You must break the yolk so it serves as a dressing to the pigs ear and mix it all together. If you just eat the pigs ear by itself, it will be too salty. The egg, kale and banana peppers helps balance all the flavors. Not sure if I&apos;d get this again though. 

Chicken thigh kebabs-You get two perfectly seasoned chicken kebabs on top of four fried smashed potatoes with Tzatziki sauce at the bottom. The chicken was very tender and went perfectly with their tasty tzatziki sauce. The potatoes we&apos;re good and worked as a starchy filler. The dish was tasty but $20 for two chicken kebabs was a tad bit much. Wouldn&apos;t mind ordering again, but would probably try some other plates next time. 

Whipped Feta- This dish was tasty. It came with toast and plenty of whipped feta to spread on the toast. The whipped feta came with cucumber and marinated tomatoes. The tomatoes were very tasty and tasted sweet. I would definitely order this dish again. 

Roasted Bone Marrow- This dish was my favorite dish of the night. It came with herbs, capers and onions with a side of Maldonado sea salt. You spread the bone marrow on the toast, grab some of the salt and sprinkle it on top, and then you top it off with the greens. A perfect bite every time. I would order this dish again and again. 

For dessert we opted for their popular &quot;Sicilian Iris.&quot; I will admit by dessert time, we were already stuffed, and whenever we&apos;re completely full we skip dessert. But since it was our anniversary and since it&apos;s the Purple Pig, we had to try a little bit of everything. The Sicilian iris, was tasty. It came warm and the fried ball was huge. It came stuffed ricotta, and chocolate chip. It reminded me of a warm gooey ball version of a cannoli. I wouldn&apos;t mind ordering this again. 

Overall, The Purple Pig hype is real. Everything was phenomenal. Flaw customer service, delicious food. Will definitely be returning."
5,"I had a great time at The Purple Pig. They recently opened the outdoor so I decided to give it a try. I was lucky to get a reservation spot on Tock. The reservation does require a $20 fee which will be applied to the check, but sometimes they might forget, so you want to check the final bill. The outdoor area was very small- maybe 5-6 tables, but it was fenced off and had its own trailer bathroom. 
We ordered the duck, pork shoulder, pork belly, broccoli and sweet corn. They were all really good.
The drinks were good as the portions were generous and there were a lot of alcohol in them- which is a plus!
All the meat dishes were very tender and the vegetable dishes were really nice too. It was one of the best broccoli dishes I have tried! The pork belly was a bit fatty, but it was soft and well cooked. The pork shoulder was meaty and the gravy, mashed potato and meat all went very well together.
The duck was massive, but still very soft and juicy. 
Some reviews mentioned that the portions are small but we had more than enough food and walked out very full.
I am not sure if this is worth the hype or the wait in the pre-covid period, but I thought the prices are relatively reasonable for the quality of food and there are many good options. Perhaps not the best in Chicago, but definitely the best in River North around Michigan Ave :)"
5,"Great place! 
Quite tasty and very affordable! Recently my friend and I went to this amazing restaurant. We ordered their best-seller food, and we were so pleased to find it wonderful! It was really tasty.  Both of us were pleased with the food and the operation. 
Thank you very much to all of you, guys!"
5,"We celebrated our anniversary in Chicago and one of our favorite spots was the Purple Pig. We were sad that it was just the two of us, because we wanted to order one of everything on the menu, but that would turn us into the purple pigs, so we went with a few favorites. The wait was minimal, and gave us a chance to sample some cheese and wine before we dined.

The dishes are rich and full of flavor, but we would have licked the plates if it wasn&apos;t rude to do in public-ha!

Some of our favorites were the Spanish octopus, pork jowl, pork liver pate, salt beets, and scallops. We kept seeing the turkey leg go by, but were so full, we couldn&apos;t make it work. Oh well, I guess we have to go back."
3,"Service was good. And food was okay. Their portions weren&apos;t very impressive &amp; the cost is quite high. I noticed they move their restaurant. I&apos;ve heard such great things about this restaurant and although food was good; it just wasn&apos;t THAT good. They have a $20 non refundable deposit to reserve a table. I assume it&apos;s cause of the pandemic and they don&apos;t want to hold a table for a no show. Everyone was socially distanced and staffs were wearing masks so it looks like they&apos;re honoring the safety guidelines. They also checked our temperature upon arrival. I definitely don&apos;t regret coming to try the food but don&apos;t think I&apos;ll go back just because the price is too high, portion size isn&apos;t too impressive, &amp; food was just average."
5,"My FAVORITE restaurant in all of Chicago hands down! The menu changes often but always features delicious, unique flavors. All the ingredients are so fresh and crafted together so perfectly. If on the menu- the broccoli, hot dog, and duck have been some of my all time favorites! You really can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu though. For the quality of food, it&apos;s very reasonably priced and worth every penny."
5,"I&apos;ve heard quite a bit about the Purple Pig,  but never found the time to go. This morning, we decided to go to their brunch. I am glad I did as it was one of the best brunches I have ever had in the city. 

I started out with a Paloma which was expertly made. We decided to go with the charcuterie board with sopressa and duck procuttio . Both are made in house. I thought the sopressa was excellent and the duck was ok. I think I&apos;ll go with another meat next time. The cheese was outstanding, but expected. The surprising Star was the bread....mmmmmmm. This board was the real deal. This seems like the thing to get with wine! 

My group shared three dishes: Chicken and Waffles, Avocado Toast, and French omelette. The omelette was expected, but excellent. A solid dish! The surprise was the Avocado Toast  which was a guacamole with the acid coming from the olives and cucumbers. It was a weird combo, but it worked! The chicken and waffles were the best I&apos;ve ever had! The waffle was more savory than sweet which I loved. The chicken was pretty epic too! 

Yes, this place is pretty pricey, but well worth the price! I knew it was good, but I never imagined it would be THAT good! One of the best brunches I&apos;ve had in Chicago, no question!"
5,"The milk braised pork shoulder is one of the best dishes I have had in Chicago. Bone marrow is also a must, the presentation was incredible and makes for a fun food-sharing experience. At least 3-4 dishes for two people."
5,A great place to stop by in Chicago. Try to reserve a table ahead of time to make sure you don&apos;t have to wait an hour or more. Definitely great service and good recommendations. Will definitely come back to try new things next time!
4,"Only came here for happy hour, but had a good experience.  My friends and I sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and attentive.  It was quiet when we arrived, but filled up after work (this was pre-COVID precautions).  Their happy hours specials were a good deal, and also tasted good.  The food menu looked good, so I would love to go back at some time to try a good meal (or at least happy hour with some appetizers)."
5,"Great menu, great service, unique food! A real treat! Will be back! This is an innovative, very creative menu."
4,"FOOD: Tapas with a heavy emphasis on MEAT. The COVID menu is a bit smaller than what I remembered from my last visit, but they had a great cheese/charcuterie selection (including a prosciutto duck!) and fan favorites pork shoulder and belly. The food is rich and full and the flavors are certainly not what you would expect from typical tapas 

SERVICE: Prompt service with great attitudes. No issues here

EXPERIENCE: The new location has multiple indoor seating options as well as a patio out back

VALUE: Deceiving large portion sizes. Between two people, we had two appetizers and two entrees and had enough for a full meals worth of left overs. Appetizers are about $10-15 and entrees $20-35

SUMMARY: Amazing meats and intriguing menu. This place is a classic and well worth the wait. Have come back multiple times and will continue to do so in the future"
5,"If you are looking for a good wine and tapas place in Chicago this is the way to go!! 

We came here on a Sunday morning around 11:30am and it wasn&apos;t too busy. The service was great and our server told us how it works here as it&apos;s mostly shared plates so about 5 plates was good for the 4 of us. 

We ordered:
crispy pig ears - these were way too salty for my taste but I liked the crunch
ricotta gnocchi-so cheesy and decadent but definitely heavy!
the bacon and liver pate-this was my absolute fav!!! It was so tasty
the pork belly-so tender and fatty with a really good sauce
The rib hash off the brunch menu-I loved that it came with an egg and the rib meat was tender.

Really good shared plates and they had a good selection of wine and cocktails!"
5,"Our company had a small corporate party (just around 8 people) and we&apos;ve decided to check out the Purple pig. And it was absolutely awesome decision as the food is very delicious, pork was crispy and tasty. They also have a good  wine menu. Everyone got satisfied of that evening.
And what is also important, the staff wear masks"
4,"I came here for dinner after a show during peak dinner hours and the wait was actually a lot shorter than I expected. I left my name and walked around and I got a notification about 15mins that my table was ready. The atmosphere is casual and loud. The seating was a bit tight and my table was very close to the tables beside me. 

FOOD:
In terms of food, I enjoyed most of the dishes I had. My favorites included the octopus and the bucatini. There was one dish that I didn&apos;t like which is the milk braised berkshire shoulder. The item seemed interesting so I decided to give it a try. The pork was tender but I didn&apos;t love the flavor profile of it. 

OVERALL:
I enjoyed most of the foods that I had and the service was great. I would highly recommend this restaurant."
5,"Not gonna lie, I&apos;m normally a non-believer in fancy cuisine, but my friend who was visiting wanted to come here, and now I can&apos;t wait to go back. We came early and enjoyed being the only guests for brunch. It&apos;s a beautiful restaurant with great service. All three dishes we tried, we liked."
5,Actually I changed my mind. Sometimes it takes time to learn what true greatness really is.
4,"TL;DR
What to order:
- Italian Feast - unfortunately it looks like they&apos;ve moved onto the &quot;Greek Feast&quot; :( - $18 per person + tax + tip

What to watch out for
- we specified 5:30 as the pickup time but they messaged us way earlier around 4pm to come pickup the food; when we got the food it was still somewhat warm but I don&apos;t understand why they didn&apos;t stick to the specified time...

=====

Ordered the Italian feast for 2 a couple weeks ago using Tock and it was really good! It comes with chicken cacciatore with potatoes; a salad with goat cheese, beets, and roasted asparagus; and a baked pasta with cheese and pork neckbone gravy. 

The highlights were definitely the chicken in the cacciatore, the asparagus in the salad, and the pasta was really good as a whole! The chicken fell off the bone and was extremely tender, the pasta was perfectly al dente, and everything in general was very flavorful. The portion sizes were fine and we spread out all the food across maybe two-ish meals each. They give you one salad box per person but everything else just comes in one container.

Some lowlights were that in the 2-person portion we got maybe 3 or so pieces of chicken and a lot of potato. The salad&apos;s dressing was also quite sweet, but as far as salads go, I mean, it was fine (I don&apos;t eat salads for the taste, I&apos;m afraid).

Overall I would love to try their other takeout options! ~$20 per person for the Purple Pig is a pretty darned good deal compared to their normal prices, and for the quality of food you get. Only docking a star for the pickup time snafu."
3,Perhaps they had an off night. Everything was... good... but modes not compare to places down south.

The rib hash off the brunch menu-I loved that it came with an egg and the rib meat was tender.

Really good shared plates and they had a good selection of wine and cocktails!"
5,"Our company had a small corporate party (just around 8 people) and we&apos;ve decided to check out the Purple pig. And it was absolutely awesome decision as the food is very delicious, pork was crispy and tasty. They also have a good  wine menu. Everyone got satisfied of that evening.
And what is also important, the staff wear masks"
4,"I came here for dinner after a show during peak dinner hours and the wait was actually a lot shorter than I expected. I left my name and walked around and I got a notification about 15mins that my table was ready. The atmosphere is casual and loud. The seating was a bit tight and my table was very close to the tables beside me. 

FOOD:
In terms of food, I enjoyed most of the dishes I had. My favorites included the octopus and the bucatini. There was one dish that I didn&apos;t like which is the milk braised berkshire shoulder. The item seemed interesting so I decided to give it a try. The pork was tender but I didn&apos;t love the flavor profile of it. 

OVERALL:
I enjoyed most of the foods that I had and the service was great. I would highly recommend this restaurant."
5,"Not gonna lie, I&apos;m normally a non-believer in fancy cuisine, but my friend who was visiting wanted to come here, and now I can&apos;t wait to go back. We came early and enjoyed being the only guests for brunch. It&apos;s a beautiful restaurant with great service. All three dishes we tried, we liked."
5,Actually I changed my mind. Sometimes it takes time to learn what true greatness really is.
4,"TL;DR
What to order:
- Italian Feast - unfortunately it looks like they&apos;ve moved onto the &quot;Greek Feast&quot; :( - $18 per person + tax + tip

What to watch out for
- we specified 5:30 as the pickup time but they messaged us way earlier around 4pm to come pickup the food; when we got the food it was still somewhat warm but I don&apos;t understand why they didn&apos;t stick to the specified time...

=====

Ordered the Italian feast for 2 a couple weeks ago using Tock and it was really good! It comes with chicken cacciatore with potatoes; a salad with goat cheese, beets, and roasted asparagus; and a baked pasta with cheese and pork neckbone gravy. 

The highlights were definitely the chicken in the cacciatore, the asparagus in the salad, and the pasta was really good as a whole! The chicken fell off the bone and was extremely tender, the pasta was perfectly al dente, and everything in general was very flavorful. The portion sizes were fine and we spread out all the food across maybe two-ish meals each. They give you one salad box per person but everything else just comes in one container.

Some lowlights were that in the 2-person portion we got maybe 3 or so pieces of chicken and a lot of potato. The salad&apos;s dressing was also quite sweet, but as far as salads go, I mean, it was fine (I don&apos;t eat salads for the taste, I&apos;m afraid).

Overall I would love to try their other takeout options! ~$20 per person for the Purple Pig is a pretty darned good deal compared to their normal prices, and for the quality of food you get. Only docking a star for the pickup time snafu."
3,Perhaps they had an off night. Everything was... good... but modes not compare to places down south.
5,"On my 35th birthday I finally got to try The Purple Pig after all these years. Every time I&apos;ve gone in the past, I haven&apos;t had any luck because they usually don&apos;t take reservations and the wait was always so long; however, because of COVID-19, they are now taking reservations!

They definitely lived up to the hype after all these years and I was super happy with all the menu items we ordered. My favorite dish was the crispy pig ears with kale. It was like having elevated Chicharrón with crispy kale. The pickled banana peppers added the proper amount of acidity and the yolk from the fried egg soaked up all the flavors perfectly.

If you&apos;re looking for comfort food, the milk braise pork shoulder provided all of that. The gravy was mind blowing! Throw in some great cocktails and wine pairings and The Purple Pig is the perfect casual-chic restaurant for tourists and locals alike! You can&apos;t go wrong with any menu item here!"
5,"We came here to celebrate our anniversary. This place is known for long wait times and not allowing reservations. Not luckily, but luckily because of COVID, they are currently doing reservations. So we&apos;re able to walk in with our reservation and get a table right away. I will admit, this place was very casual and I felt like we were over dressed. They were very professional throughout the night and did really great explaining every dish and giving directions on how to eat the food so you can get the best taste out of each dish. Jimmy Bannos Jr. even stopped by our table to talk a little bit and made sure we were enjoying our night. 

We started off our night with a couple of drinks. My wife ordered their &quot;Paloma&quot; and I was feeling rich and magical that night and ordered their &quot;24 Carrot Magic.&quot; The Paloma was a simple classic made with Espolon blanco tequila, lime juice and grapefruit soda. It&apos;s really hard to get this one wrong. Definitely tasty. The 24 carrot Magic was something different. This one came with corazon reposado tequila, ancho Reyes Chile liqueur, carrot juice, lime juice and ginger syrup. A drink with a kick of heat, thanks to the ancho Reyes Chile liqueur. Never heard of such liqueur and is now on my list of things to buy! The carrot juice was overpower and made the drink taste healthy. I just wish they had the wider selection of drinks, the at least the drinks we both got were fantastic. 

We started off with their Crispy Pigs Ear and ended up with a total of four entries plus dessert. 

Crispy Pigs Ear-This seems to be a very popular dish. It&apos;s served with salty crispy pigs ear, mixed with kale, and pickled banana peppers and topped with a fried egg. You must break the yolk so it serves as a dressing to the pigs ear and mix it all together. If you just eat the pigs ear by itself, it will be too salty. The egg, kale and banana peppers helps balance all the flavors. Not sure if I&apos;d get this again though. 

Chicken thigh kebabs-You get two perfectly seasoned chicken kebabs on top of four fried smashed potatoes with Tzatziki sauce at the bottom. The chicken was very tender and went perfectly with their tasty tzatziki sauce. The potatoes we&apos;re good and worked as a starchy filler. The dish was tasty but $20 for two chicken kebabs was a tad bit much. Wouldn&apos;t mind ordering again, but would probably try some other plates next time. 

Whipped Feta- This dish was tasty. It came with toast and plenty of whipped feta to spread on the toast. The whipped feta came with cucumber and marinated tomatoes. The tomatoes were very tasty and tasted sweet. I would definitely order this dish again. 

Roasted Bone Marrow- This dish was my favorite dish of the night. It came with herbs, capers and onions with a side of Maldonado sea salt. You spread the bone marrow on the toast, grab some of the salt and sprinkle it on top, and then you top it off with the greens. A perfect bite every time. I would order this dish again and again. 

For dessert we opted for their popular &quot;Sicilian Iris.&quot; I will admit by dessert time, we were already stuffed, and whenever we&apos;re completely full we skip dessert. But since it was our anniversary and since it&apos;s the Purple Pig, we had to try a little bit of everything. The Sicilian iris, was tasty. It came warm and the fried ball was huge. It came stuffed ricotta, and chocolate chip. It reminded me of a warm gooey ball version of a cannoli. I wouldn&apos;t mind ordering this again. 

Overall, The Purple Pig hype is real. Everything was phenomenal. Flaw customer service, delicious food. Will definitely be returning."
5,"I had a great time at The Purple Pig. They recently opened the outdoor so I decided to give it a try. I was lucky to get a reservation spot on Tock. The reservation does require a $20 fee which will be applied to the check, but sometimes they might forget, so you want to check the final bill. The outdoor area was very small- maybe 5-6 tables, but it was fenced off and had its own trailer bathroom. 
We ordered the duck, pork shoulder, pork belly, broccoli and sweet corn. They were all really good.
The drinks were good as the portions were generous and there were a lot of alcohol in them- which is a plus!
All the meat dishes were very tender and the vegetable dishes were really nice too. It was one of the best broccoli dishes I have tried! The pork belly was a bit fatty, but it was soft and well cooked. The pork shoulder was meaty and the gravy, mashed potato and meat all went very well together.
The duck was massive, but still very soft and juicy. 
Some reviews mentioned that the portions are small but we had more than enough food and walked out very full.
I am not sure if this is worth the hype or the wait in the pre-covid period, but I thought the prices are relatively reasonable for the quality of food and there are many good options. Perhaps not the best in Chicago, but definitely the best in River North around Michigan Ave :)"
5,"Great place! 
Quite tasty and very affordable! Recently my friend and I went to this amazing restaurant. We ordered their best-seller food, and we were so pleased to find it wonderful! It was really tasty.  Both of us were pleased with the food and the operation. 
Thank you very much to all of you, guys!"
5,"We celebrated our anniversary in Chicago and one of our favorite spots was the Purple Pig. We were sad that it was just the two of us, because we wanted to order one of everything on the menu, but that would turn us into the purple pigs, so we went with a few favorites. The wait was minimal, and gave us a chance to sample some cheese and wine before we dined.

The dishes are rich and full of flavor, but we would have licked the plates if it wasn&apos;t rude to do in public-ha!

Some of our favorites were the Spanish octopus, pork jowl, pork liver pate, salt beets, and scallops. We kept seeing the turkey leg go by, but were so full, we couldn&apos;t make it work. Oh well, I guess we have to go back."
3,"Service was good. And food was okay. Their portions weren&apos;t very impressive &amp; the cost is quite high. I noticed they move their restaurant. I&apos;ve heard such great things about this restaurant and although food was good; it just wasn&apos;t THAT good. They have a $20 non refundable deposit to reserve a table. I assume it&apos;s cause of the pandemic and they don&apos;t want to hold a table for a no show. Everyone was socially distanced and staffs were wearing masks so it looks like they&apos;re honoring the safety guidelines. They also checked our temperature upon arrival. I definitely don&apos;t regret coming to try the food but don&apos;t think I&apos;ll go back just because the price is too high, portion size isn&apos;t too impressive, &amp; food was just average."
5,"My FAVORITE restaurant in all of Chicago hands down! The menu changes often but always features delicious, unique flavors. All the ingredients are so fresh and crafted together so perfectly. If on the menu- the broccoli, hot dog, and duck have been some of my all time favorites! You really can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu though. For the quality of food, it&apos;s very reasonably priced and worth every penny."
5,"I&apos;ve heard quite a bit about the Purple Pig,  but never found the time to go. This morning, we decided to go to their brunch. I am glad I did as it was one of the best brunches I have ever had in the city. 

I started out with a Paloma which was expertly made. We decided to go with the charcuterie board with sopressa and duck procuttio . Both are made in house. I thought the sopressa was excellent and the duck was ok. I think I&apos;ll go with another meat next time. The cheese was outstanding, but expected. The surprising Star was the bread....mmmmmmm. This board was the real deal. This seems like the thing to get with wine! 

My group shared three dishes: Chicken and Waffles, Avocado Toast, and French omelette. The omelette was expected, but excellent. A solid dish! The surprise was the Avocado Toast  which was a guacamole with the acid coming from the olives and cucumbers. It was a weird combo, but it worked! The chicken and waffles were the best I&apos;ve ever had! The waffle was more savory than sweet which I loved. The chicken was pretty epic too! 

Yes, this place is pretty pricey, but well worth the price! I knew it was good, but I never imagined it would be THAT good! One of the best brunches I&apos;ve had in Chicago, no question!"
5,"The milk braised pork shoulder is one of the best dishes I have had in Chicago. Bone marrow is also a must, the presentation was incredible and makes for a fun food-sharing experience. At least 3-4 dishes for two people."
5,A great place to stop by in Chicago. Try to reserve a table ahead of time to make sure you don&apos;t have to wait an hour or more. Definitely great service and good recommendations. Will definitely come back to try new things next time!
4,"Only came here for happy hour, but had a good experience.  My friends and I sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and attentive.  It was quiet when we arrived, but filled up after work (this was pre-COVID precautions).  Their happy hours specials were a good deal, and also tasted good.  The food menu looked good, so I would love to go back at some time to try a good meal (or at least happy hour with some appetizers)."
5,"Great menu, great service, unique food! A real treat! Will be back! This is an innovative, very creative menu."
4,"FOOD: Tapas with a heavy emphasis on MEAT. The COVID menu is a bit smaller than what I remembered from my last visit, but they had a great cheese/charcuterie selection (including a prosciutto duck!) and fan favorites pork shoulder and belly. The food is rich and full and the flavors are certainly not what you would expect from typical tapas 

SERVICE: Prompt service with great attitudes. No issues here

EXPERIENCE: The new location has multiple indoor seating options as well as a patio out back

VALUE: Deceiving large portion sizes. Between two people, we had two appetizers and two entrees and had enough for a full meals worth of left overs. Appetizers are about $10-15 and entrees $20-35

SUMMARY: Amazing meats and intriguing menu. This place is a classic and well worth the wait. Have come back multiple times and will continue to do so in the future"
5,"If you are looking for a good wine and tapas place in Chicago this is the way to go!! 

We came here on a Sunday morning around 11:30am and it wasn&apos;t too busy. The service was great and our server told us how it works here as it&apos;s mostly shared plates so about 5 plates was good for the 4 of us. 

We ordered:
crispy pig ears - these were way too salty for my taste but I liked the crunch
ricotta gnocchi-so cheesy and decadent but definitely heavy!
the bacon and liver pate-this was my absolute fav!!! It was so tasty

Ordered the Italian feast for 2 a couple weeks ago using Tock and it was really good! It comes with chicken cacciatore with potatoes; a salad with goat cheese, beets, and roasted asparagus; and a baked pasta with cheese and pork neckbone gravy. 

The highlights were definitely the chicken in the cacciatore, the asparagus in the salad, and the pasta was really good as a whole! The chicken fell off the bone and was extremely tender, the pasta was perfectly al dente, and everything in general was very flavorful. The portion sizes were fine and we spread out all the food across maybe two-ish meals each. They give you one salad box per person but everything else just comes in one container.

Some lowlights were that in the 2-person portion we got maybe 3 or so pieces of chicken and a lot of potato. The salad&apos;s dressing was also quite sweet, but as far as salads go, I mean, it was fine (I don&apos;t eat salads for the taste, I&apos;m afraid).

Overall I would love to try their other takeout options! ~$20 per person for the Purple Pig is a pretty darned good deal compared to their normal prices, and for the quality of food you get. Only docking a star for the pickup time snafu."
3,Perhaps they had an off night. Everything was... good... but modes not compare to places down south.
5,"On my 35th birthday I finally got to try The Purple Pig after all these years. Every time I&apos;ve gone in the past, I haven&apos;t had any luck because they usually don&apos;t take reservations and the wait was always so long; however, because of COVID-19, they are now taking reservations!

They definitely lived up to the hype after all these years and I was super happy with all the menu items we ordered. My favorite dish was the crispy pig ears with kale. It was like having elevated Chicharrón with crispy kale. The pickled banana peppers added the proper amount of acidity and the yolk from the fried egg soaked up all the flavors perfectly.

If you&apos;re looking for comfort food, the milk braise pork shoulder provided all of that. The gravy was mind blowing! Throw in some great cocktails and wine pairings and The Purple Pig is the perfect casual-chic restaurant for tourists and locals alike! You can&apos;t go wrong with any menu item here!"
5,"We came here to celebrate our anniversary. This place is known for long wait times and not allowing reservations. Not luckily, but luckily because of COVID, they are currently doing reservations. So we&apos;re able to walk in with our reservation and get a table right away. I will admit, this place was very casual and I felt like we were over dressed. They were very professional throughout the night and did really great explaining every dish and giving directions on how to eat the food so you can get the best taste out of each dish. Jimmy Bannos Jr. even stopped by our table to talk a little bit and made sure we were enjoying our night. 

We started off our night with a couple of drinks. My wife ordered their &quot;Paloma&quot; and I was feeling rich and magical that night and ordered their &quot;24 Carrot Magic.&quot; The Paloma was a simple classic made with Espolon blanco tequila, lime juice and grapefruit soda. It&apos;s really hard to get this one wrong. Definitely tasty. The 24 carrot Magic was something different. This one came with corazon reposado tequila, ancho Reyes Chile liqueur, carrot juice, lime juice and ginger syrup. A drink with a kick of heat, thanks to the ancho Reyes Chile liqueur. Never heard of such liqueur and is now on my list of things to buy! The carrot juice was overpower and made the drink taste healthy. I just wish they had the wider selection of drinks, the at least the drinks we both got were fantastic. 

We started off with their Crispy Pigs Ear and ended up with a total of four entries plus dessert. 

Crispy Pigs Ear-This seems to be a very popular dish. It&apos;s served with salty crispy pigs ear, mixed with kale, and pickled banana peppers and topped with a fried egg. You must break the yolk so it serves as a dressing to the pigs ear and mix it all together. If you just eat the pigs ear by itself, it will be too salty. The egg, kale and banana peppers helps balance all the flavors. Not sure if I&apos;d get this again though. 

Chicken thigh kebabs-You get two perfectly seasoned chicken kebabs on top of four fried smashed potatoes with Tzatziki sauce at the bottom. The chicken was very tender and went perfectly with their tasty tzatziki sauce. The potatoes we&apos;re good and worked as a starchy filler. The dish was tasty but $20 for two chicken kebabs was a tad bit much. Wouldn&apos;t mind ordering again, but would probably try some other plates next time. 

Whipped Feta- This dish was tasty. It came with toast and plenty of whipped feta to spread on the toast. The whipped feta came with cucumber and marinated tomatoes. The tomatoes were very tasty and tasted sweet. I would definitely order this dish again. 

Roasted Bone Marrow- This dish was my favorite dish of the night. It came with herbs, capers and onions with a side of Maldonado sea salt. You spread the bone marrow on the toast, grab some of the salt and sprinkle it on top, and then you top it off with the greens. A perfect bite every time. I would order this dish again and again. 

For dessert we opted for their popular &quot;Sicilian Iris.&quot; I will admit by dessert time, we were already stuffed, and whenever we&apos;re completely full we skip dessert. But since it was our anniversary and since it&apos;s the Purple Pig, we had to try a little bit of everything. The Sicilian iris, was tasty. It came warm and the fried ball was huge. It came stuffed ricotta, and chocolate chip. It reminded me of a warm gooey ball version of a cannoli. I wouldn&apos;t mind ordering this again. 

Overall, The Purple Pig hype is real. Everything was phenomenal. Flaw customer service, delicious food. Will definitely be returning."
5,"I had a great time at The Purple Pig. They recently opened the outdoor so I decided to give it a try. I was lucky to get a reservation spot on Tock. The reservation does require a $20 fee which will be applied to the check, but sometimes they might forget, so you want to check the final bill. The outdoor area was very small- maybe 5-6 tables, but it was fenced off and had its own trailer bathroom. 
We ordered the duck, pork shoulder, pork belly, broccoli and sweet corn. They were all really good.
The drinks were good as the portions were generous and there were a lot of alcohol in them- which is a plus!
All the meat dishes were very tender and the vegetable dishes were really nice too. It was one of the best broccoli dishes I have tried! The pork belly was a bit fatty, but it was soft and well cooked. The pork shoulder was meaty and the gravy, mashed potato and meat all went very well together.
The duck was massive, but still very soft and juicy. 
Some reviews mentioned that the portions are small but we had more than enough food and walked out very full.
I am not sure if this is worth the hype or the wait in the pre-covid period, but I thought the prices are relatively reasonable for the quality of food and there are many good options. Perhaps not the best in Chicago, but definitely the best in River North around Michigan Ave :)"
5,"Great place! 
Quite tasty and very affordable! Recently my friend and I went to this amazing restaurant. We ordered their best-seller food, and we were so pleased to find it wonderful! It was really tasty.  Both of us were pleased with the food and the operation. 
Thank you very much to all of you, guys!"
5,"We celebrated our anniversary in Chicago and one of our favorite spots was the Purple Pig. We were sad that it was just the two of us, because we wanted to order one of everything on the menu, but that would turn us into the purple pigs, so we went with a few favorites. The wait was minimal, and gave us a chance to sample some cheese and wine before we dined.

The dishes are rich and full of flavor, but we would have licked the plates if it wasn&apos;t rude to do in public-ha!

Some of our favorites were the Spanish octopus, pork jowl, pork liver pate, salt beets, and scallops. We kept seeing the turkey leg go by, but were so full, we couldn&apos;t make it work. Oh well, I guess we have to go back."
3,"Service was good. And food was okay. Their portions weren&apos;t very impressive &amp; the cost is quite high. I noticed they move their restaurant. I&apos;ve heard such great things about this restaurant and although food was good; it just wasn&apos;t THAT good. They have a $20 non refundable deposit to reserve a table. I assume it&apos;s cause of the pandemic and they don&apos;t want to hold a table for a no show. Everyone was socially distanced and staffs were wearing masks so it looks like they&apos;re honoring the safety guidelines. They also checked our temperature upon arrival. I definitely don&apos;t regret coming to try the food but don&apos;t think I&apos;ll go back just because the price is too high, portion size isn&apos;t too impressive, &amp; food was just average."
5,"My FAVORITE restaurant in all of Chicago hands down! The menu changes often but always features delicious, unique flavors. All the ingredients are so fresh and crafted together so perfectly. If on the menu- the broccoli, hot dog, and duck have been some of my all time favorites! You really can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu though. For the quality of food, it&apos;s very reasonably priced and worth every penny."
5,"I&apos;ve heard quite a bit about the Purple Pig,  but never found the time to go. This morning, we decided to go to their brunch. I am glad I did as it was one of the best brunches I have ever had in the city. 

I started out with a Paloma which was expertly made. We decided to go with the charcuterie board with sopressa and duck procuttio . Both are made in house. I thought the sopressa was excellent and the duck was ok. I think I&apos;ll go with another meat next time. The cheese was outstanding, but expected. The surprising Star was the bread....mmmmmmm. This board was the real deal. This seems like the thing to get with wine! 

My group shared three dishes: Chicken and Waffles, Avocado Toast, and French omelette. The omelette was expected, but excellent. A solid dish! The surprise was the Avocado Toast  which was a guacamole with the acid coming from the olives and cucumbers. It was a weird combo, but it worked! The chicken and waffles were the best I&apos;ve ever had! The waffle was more savory than sweet which I loved. The chicken was pretty epic too! 

Yes, this place is pretty pricey, but well worth the price! I knew it was good, but I never imagined it would be THAT good! One of the best brunches I&apos;ve had in Chicago, no question!"
5,"The milk braised pork shoulder is one of the best dishes I have had in Chicago. Bone marrow is also a must, the presentation was incredible and makes for a fun food-sharing experience. At least 3-4 dishes for two people."
5,A great place to stop by in Chicago. Try to reserve a table ahead of time to make sure you don&apos;t have to wait an hour or more. Definitely great service and good recommendations. Will definitely come back to try new things next time!
4,"Only came here for happy hour, but had a good experience.  My friends and I sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and attentive.  It was quiet when we arrived, but filled up after work (this was pre-COVID precautions).  Their happy hours specials were a good deal, and also tasted good.  The food menu looked good, so I would love to go back at some time to try a good meal (or at least happy hour with some appetizers)."
5,"Great menu, great service, unique food! A real treat! Will be back! This is an innovative, very creative menu."
4,"FOOD: Tapas with a heavy emphasis on MEAT. The COVID menu is a bit smaller than what I remembered from my last visit, but they had a great cheese/charcuterie selection (including a prosciutto duck!) and fan favorites pork shoulder and belly. The food is rich and full and the flavors are certainly not what you would expect from typical tapas 

SERVICE: Prompt service with great attitudes. No issues here

EXPERIENCE: The new location has multiple indoor seating options as well as a patio out back

VALUE: Deceiving large portion sizes. Between two people, we had two appetizers and two entrees and had enough for a full meals worth of left overs. Appetizers are about $10-15 and entrees $20-35

SUMMARY: Amazing meats and intriguing menu. This place is a classic and well worth the wait. Have come back multiple times and will continue to do so in the future"
5,"If you are looking for a good wine and tapas place in Chicago this is the way to go!! 

We came here on a Sunday morning around 11:30am and it wasn&apos;t too busy. The service was great and our server told us how it works here as it&apos;s mostly shared plates so about 5 plates was good for the 4 of us. 

We ordered:
crispy pig ears - these were way too salty for my taste but I liked the crunch
ricotta gnocchi-so cheesy and decadent but definitely heavy!
the bacon and liver pate-this was my absolute fav!!! It was so tasty
the pork belly-so tender and fatty with a really good sauce
The rib hash off the brunch menu-I loved that it came with an egg and the rib meat was tender.

Really good shared plates and they had a good selection of wine and cocktails!"
5,"Our company had a small corporate party (just around 8 people) and we&apos;ve decided to check out the Purple pig. And it was absolutely awesome decision as the food is very delicious, pork was crispy and tasty. They also have a good  wine menu. Everyone got satisfied of that evening.
And what is also important, the staff wear masks"
4,"I came here for dinner after a show during peak dinner hours and the wait was actually a lot shorter than I expected. I left my name and walked around and I got a notification about 15mins that my table was ready. The atmosphere is casual and loud. The seating was a bit tight and my table was very close to the tables beside me. 

FOOD:
In terms of food, I enjoyed most of the dishes I had. My favorites included the octopus and the bucatini. There was one dish that I didn&apos;t like which is the milk braised berkshire shoulder. The item seemed interesting so I decided to give it a try. The pork was tender but I didn&apos;t love the flavor profile of it. 

OVERALL:
I enjoyed most of the foods that I had and the service was great. I would highly recommend this restaurant."
5,"Not gonna lie, I&apos;m normally a non-believer in fancy cuisine, but my friend who was visiting wanted to come here, and now I can&apos;t wait to go back. We came early and enjoyed being the only guests for brunch. It&apos;s a beautiful restaurant with great service. All three dishes we tried, we liked."
5,Actually I changed my mind. Sometimes it takes time to learn what true greatness really is.

5,"We came here to celebrate our anniversary. This place is known for long wait times and not allowing reservations. Not luckily, but luckily because of COVID, they are currently doing reservations. So we&apos;re able to walk in with our reservation and get a table right away. I will admit, this place was very casual and I felt like we were over dressed. They were very professional throughout the night and did really great explaining every dish and giving directions on how to eat the food so you can get the best taste out of each dish. Jimmy Bannos Jr. even stopped by our table to talk a little bit and made sure we were enjoying our night. 

We started off our night with a couple of drinks. My wife ordered their &quot;Paloma&quot; and I was feeling rich and magical that night and ordered their &quot;24 Carrot Magic.&quot; The Paloma was a simple classic made with Espolon blanco tequila, lime juice and grapefruit soda. It&apos;s really hard to get this one wrong. Definitely tasty. The 24 carrot Magic was something different. This one came with corazon reposado tequila, ancho Reyes Chile liqueur, carrot juice, lime juice and ginger syrup. A drink with a kick of heat, thanks to the ancho Reyes Chile liqueur. Never heard of such liqueur and is now on my list of things to buy! The carrot juice was overpower and made the drink taste healthy. I just wish they had the wider selection of drinks, the at least the drinks we both got were fantastic. 

We started off with their Crispy Pigs Ear and ended up with a total of four entries plus dessert. 

Crispy Pigs Ear-This seems to be a very popular dish. It&apos;s served with salty crispy pigs ear, mixed with kale, and pickled banana peppers and topped with a fried egg. You must break the yolk so it serves as a dressing to the pigs ear and mix it all together. If you just eat the pigs ear by itself, it will be too salty. The egg, kale and banana peppers helps balance all the flavors. Not sure if I&apos;d get this again though. 

Chicken thigh kebabs-You get two perfectly seasoned chicken kebabs on top of four fried smashed potatoes with Tzatziki sauce at the bottom. The chicken was very tender and went perfectly with their tasty tzatziki sauce. The potatoes we&apos;re good and worked as a starchy filler. The dish was tasty but $20 for two chicken kebabs was a tad bit much. Wouldn&apos;t mind ordering again, but would probably try some other plates next time. 

Whipped Feta- This dish was tasty. It came with toast and plenty of whipped feta to spread on the toast. The whipped feta came with cucumber and marinated tomatoes. The tomatoes were very tasty and tasted sweet. I would definitely order this dish again. 

Roasted Bone Marrow- This dish was my favorite dish of the night. It came with herbs, capers and onions with a side of Maldonado sea salt. You spread the bone marrow on the toast, grab some of the salt and sprinkle it on top, and then you top it off with the greens. A perfect bite every time. I would order this dish again and again. 

For dessert we opted for their popular &quot;Sicilian Iris.&quot; I will admit by dessert time, we were already stuffed, and whenever we&apos;re completely full we skip dessert. But since it was our anniversary and since it&apos;s the Purple Pig, we had to try a little bit of everything. The Sicilian iris, was tasty. It came warm and the fried ball was huge. It came stuffed ricotta, and chocolate chip. It reminded me of a warm gooey ball version of a cannoli. I wouldn&apos;t mind ordering this again. 

Overall, The Purple Pig hype is real. Everything was phenomenal. Flaw customer service, delicious food. Will definitely be returning."
5,"I had a great time at The Purple Pig. They recently opened the outdoor so I decided to give it a try. I was lucky to get a reservation spot on Tock. The reservation does require a $20 fee which will be applied to the check, but sometimes they might forget, so you want to check the final bill. The outdoor area was very small- maybe 5-6 tables, but it was fenced off and had its own trailer bathroom. 
We ordered the duck, pork shoulder, pork belly, broccoli and sweet corn. They were all really good.
The drinks were good as the portions were generous and there were a lot of alcohol in them- which is a plus!
All the meat dishes were very tender and the vegetable dishes were really nice too. It was one of the best broccoli dishes I have tried! The pork belly was a bit fatty, but it was soft and well cooked. The pork shoulder was meaty and the gravy, mashed potato and meat all went very well together.
The duck was massive, but still very soft and juicy. 
Some reviews mentioned that the portions are small but we had more than enough food and walked out very full.
I am not sure if this is worth the hype or the wait in the pre-covid period, but I thought the prices are relatively reasonable for the quality of food and there are many good options. Perhaps not the best in Chicago, but definitely the best in River North around Michigan Ave :)"
5,"Great place! 
Quite tasty and very affordable! Recently my friend and I went to this amazing restaurant. We ordered their best-seller food, and we were so pleased to find it wonderful! It was really tasty.  Both of us were pleased with the food and the operation. 
Thank you very much to all of you, guys!"
5,"We celebrated our anniversary in Chicago and one of our favorite spots was the Purple Pig. We were sad that it was just the two of us, because we wanted to order one of everything on the menu, but that would turn us into the purple pigs, so we went with a few favorites. The wait was minimal, and gave us a chance to sample some cheese and wine before we dined.

The dishes are rich and full of flavor, but we would have licked the plates if it wasn&apos;t rude to do in public-ha!

Some of our favorites were the Spanish octopus, pork jowl, pork liver pate, salt beets, and scallops. We kept seeing the turkey leg go by, but were so full, we couldn&apos;t make it work. Oh well, I guess we have to go back."
3,"Service was good. And food was okay. Their portions weren&apos;t very impressive &amp; the cost is quite high. I noticed they move their restaurant. I&apos;ve heard such great things about this restaurant and although food was good; it just wasn&apos;t THAT good. They have a $20 non refundable deposit to reserve a table. I assume it&apos;s cause of the pandemic and they don&apos;t want to hold a table for a no show. Everyone was socially distanced and staffs were wearing masks so it looks like they&apos;re honoring the safety guidelines. They also checked our temperature upon arrival. I definitely don&apos;t regret coming to try the food but don&apos;t think I&apos;ll go back just because the price is too high, portion size isn&apos;t too impressive, &amp; food was just average."
5,"My FAVORITE restaurant in all of Chicago hands down! The menu changes often but always features delicious, unique flavors. All the ingredients are so fresh and crafted together so perfectly. If on the menu- the broccoli, hot dog, and duck have been some of my all time favorites! You really can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu though. For the quality of food, it&apos;s very reasonably priced and worth every penny."
5,"I&apos;ve heard quite a bit about the Purple Pig,  but never found the time to go. This morning, we decided to go to their brunch. I am glad I did as it was one of the best brunches I have ever had in the city. 

I started out with a Paloma which was expertly made. We decided to go with the charcuterie board with sopressa and duck procuttio . Both are made in house. I thought the sopressa was excellent and the duck was ok. I think I&apos;ll go with another meat next time. The cheese was outstanding, but expected. The surprising Star was the bread....mmmmmmm. This board was the real deal. This seems like the thing to get with wine! 

My group shared three dishes: Chicken and Waffles, Avocado Toast, and French omelette. The omelette was expected, but excellent. A solid dish! The surprise was the Avocado Toast  which was a guacamole with the acid coming from the olives and cucumbers. It was a weird combo, but it worked! The chicken and waffles were the best I&apos;ve ever had! The waffle was more savory than sweet which I loved. The chicken was pretty epic too! 

Yes, this place is pretty pricey, but well worth the price! I knew it was good, but I never imagined it would be THAT good! One of the best brunches I&apos;ve had in Chicago, no question!"
5,"The milk braised pork shoulder is one of the best dishes I have had in Chicago. Bone marrow is also a must, the presentation was incredible and makes for a fun food-sharing experience. At least 3-4 dishes for two people."
5,A great place to stop by in Chicago. Try to reserve a table ahead of time to make sure you don&apos;t have to wait an hour or more. Definitely great service and good recommendations. Will definitely come back to try new things next time!
4,"Only came here for happy hour, but had a good experience.  My friends and I sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and attentive.  It was quiet when we arrived, but filled up after work (this was pre-COVID precautions).  Their happy hours specials were a good deal, and also tasted good.  The food menu looked good, so I would love to go back at some time to try a good meal (or at least happy hour with some appetizers)."
5,"Great menu, great service, unique food! A real treat! Will be back! This is an innovative, very creative menu."
4,"FOOD: Tapas with a heavy emphasis on MEAT. The COVID menu is a bit smaller than what I remembered from my last visit, but they had a great cheese/charcuterie selection (including a prosciutto duck!) and fan favorites pork shoulder and belly. The food is rich and full and the flavors are certainly not what you would expect from typical tapas 

SERVICE: Prompt service with great attitudes. No issues here

EXPERIENCE: The new location has multiple indoor seating options as well as a patio out back

VALUE: Deceiving large portion sizes. Between two people, we had two appetizers and two entrees and had enough for a full meals worth of left overs. Appetizers are about $10-15 and entrees $20-35

SUMMARY: Amazing meats and intriguing menu. This place is a classic and well worth the wait. Have come back multiple times and will continue to do so in the future"
5,"If you are looking for a good wine and tapas place in Chicago this is the way to go!! 

We came here on a Sunday morning around 11:30am and it wasn&apos;t too busy. The service was great and our server told us how it works here as it&apos;s mostly shared plates so about 5 plates was good for the 4 of us. 

We ordered:
crispy pig ears - these were way too salty for my taste but I liked the crunch
ricotta gnocchi-so cheesy and decadent but definitely heavy!
the bacon and liver pate-this was my absolute fav!!! It was so tasty
the pork belly-so tender and fatty with a really good sauce
The rib hash off the brunch menu-I loved that it came with an egg and the rib meat was tender.

Really good shared plates and they had a good selection of wine and cocktails!"
5,"Our company had a small corporate party (just around 8 people) and we&apos;ve decided to check out the Purple pig. And it was absolutely awesome decision as the food is very delicious, pork was crispy and tasty. They also have a good  wine menu. Everyone got satisfied of that evening.
And what is also important, the staff wear masks"
4,"I came here for dinner after a show during peak dinner hours and the wait was actually a lot shorter than I expected. I left my name and walked around and I got a notification about 15mins that my table was ready. The atmosphere is casual and loud. The seating was a bit tight and my table was very close to the tables beside me. 

FOOD:
In terms of food, I enjoyed most of the dishes I had. My favorites included the octopus and the bucatini. There was one dish that I didn&apos;t like which is the milk braised berkshire shoulder. The item seemed interesting so I decided to give it a try. The pork was tender but I didn&apos;t love the flavor profile of it. 

OVERALL:
I enjoyed most of the foods that I had and the service was great. I would highly recommend this restaurant."
5,"Not gonna lie, I&apos;m normally a non-believer in fancy cuisine, but my friend who was visiting wanted to come here, and now I can&apos;t wait to go back. We came early and enjoyed being the only guests for brunch. It&apos;s a beautiful restaurant with great service. All three dishes we tried, we liked."
5,Actually I changed my mind. Sometimes it takes time to learn what true greatness really is.
4,"TL;DR
What to order:
- Italian Feast - unfortunately it looks like they&apos;ve moved onto the &quot;Greek Feast&quot; :( - $18 per person + tax + tip

What to watch out for
- we specified 5:30 as the pickup time but they messaged us way earlier around 4pm to come pickup the food; when we got the food it was still somewhat warm but I don&apos;t understand why they didn&apos;t stick to the specified time...

=====

Ordered the Italian feast for 2 a couple weeks ago using Tock and it was really good! It comes with chicken cacciatore with potatoes; a salad with goat cheese, beets, and roasted asparagus; and a baked pasta with cheese and pork neckbone gravy. 

The highlights were definitely the chicken in the cacciatore, the asparagus in the salad, and the pasta was really good as a whole! The chicken fell off the bone and was extremely tender, the pasta was perfectly al dente, and everything in general was very flavorful. The portion sizes were fine and we spread out all the food across maybe two-ish meals each. They give you one salad box per person but everything else just comes in one container.

Some lowlights were that in the 2-person portion we got maybe 3 or so pieces of chicken and a lot of potato. The salad&apos;s dressing was also quite sweet, but as far as salads go, I mean, it was fine (I don&apos;t eat salads for the taste, I&apos;m afraid).

Overall I would love to try their other takeout options! ~$20 per person for the Purple Pig is a pretty darned good deal compared to their normal prices, and for the quality of food you get. Only docking a star for the pickup time snafu."
3,Perhaps they had an off night. Everything was... good... but modes not compare to places down south.
5,"On my 35th birthday I finally got to try The Purple Pig after all these years. Every time I&apos;ve gone in the past, I haven&apos;t had any luck because they usually don&apos;t take reservations and the wait was always so long; however, because of COVID-19, they are now taking reservations!

They definitely lived up to the hype after all these years and I was super happy with all the menu items we ordered. My favorite dish was the crispy pig ears with kale. It was like having elevated Chicharrón with crispy kale. The pickled banana peppers added the proper amount of acidity and the yolk from the fried egg soaked up all the flavors perfectly.

If you&apos;re looking for comfort food, the milk braise pork shoulder provided all of that. The gravy was mind blowing! Throw in some great cocktails and wine pairings and The Purple Pig is the perfect casual-chic restaurant for tourists and locals alike! You can&apos;t go wrong with any menu item here!"

The dish was tasty but $20 for two chicken kebabs was a tad bit much. Wouldn&apos;t mind ordering again, but would probably try some other plates next time. 

Whipped Feta- This dish was tasty. It came with toast and plenty of whipped feta to spread on the toast. The whipped feta came with cucumber and marinated tomatoes. The tomatoes were very tasty and tasted sweet. I would definitely order this dish again. 

Roasted Bone Marrow- This dish was my favorite dish of the night. It came with herbs, capers and onions with a side of Maldonado sea salt. You spread the bone marrow on the toast, grab some of the salt and sprinkle it on top, and then you top it off with the greens. A perfect bite every time. I would order this dish again and again. 

For dessert we opted for their popular &quot;Sicilian Iris.&quot; I will admit by dessert time, we were already stuffed, and whenever we&apos;re completely full we skip dessert. But since it was our anniversary and since it&apos;s the Purple Pig, we had to try a little bit of everything. The Sicilian iris, was tasty. It came warm and the fried ball was huge. It came stuffed ricotta, and chocolate chip. It reminded me of a warm gooey ball version of a cannoli. I wouldn&apos;t mind ordering this again. 

Overall, The Purple Pig hype is real. Everything was phenomenal. Flaw customer service, delicious food. Will definitely be returning."
5,"I had a great time at The Purple Pig. They recently opened the outdoor so I decided to give it a try. I was lucky to get a reservation spot on Tock. The reservation does require a $20 fee which will be applied to the check, but sometimes they might forget, so you want to check the final bill. The outdoor area was very small- maybe 5-6 tables, but it was fenced off and had its own trailer bathroom. 
We ordered the duck, pork shoulder, pork belly, broccoli and sweet corn. They were all really good.
The drinks were good as the portions were generous and there were a lot of alcohol in them- which is a plus!
All the meat dishes were very tender and the vegetable dishes were really nice too. It was one of the best broccoli dishes I have tried! The pork belly was a bit fatty, but it was soft and well cooked. The pork shoulder was meaty and the gravy, mashed potato and meat all went very well together.
The duck was massive, but still very soft and juicy. 
Some reviews mentioned that the portions are small but we had more than enough food and walked out very full.
I am not sure if this is worth the hype or the wait in the pre-covid period, but I thought the prices are relatively reasonable for the quality of food and there are many good options. Perhaps not the best in Chicago, but definitely the best in River North around Michigan Ave :)"
5,"Great place! 
Quite tasty and very affordable! Recently my friend and I went to this amazing restaurant. We ordered their best-seller food, and we were so pleased to find it wonderful! It was really tasty.  Both of us were pleased with the food and the operation. 
Thank you very much to all of you, guys!"
5,"We celebrated our anniversary in Chicago and one of our favorite spots was the Purple Pig. We were sad that it was just the two of us, because we wanted to order one of everything on the menu, but that would turn us into the purple pigs, so we went with a few favorites. The wait was minimal, and gave us a chance to sample some cheese and wine before we dined.

The dishes are rich and full of flavor, but we would have licked the plates if it wasn&apos;t rude to do in public-ha!

Some of our favorites were the Spanish octopus, pork jowl, pork liver pate, salt beets, and scallops. We kept seeing the turkey leg go by, but were so full, we couldn&apos;t make it work. Oh well, I guess we have to go back."
3,"Service was good. And food was okay. Their portions weren&apos;t very impressive &amp; the cost is quite high. I noticed they move their restaurant. I&apos;ve heard such great things about this restaurant and although food was good; it just wasn&apos;t THAT good. They have a $20 non refundable deposit to reserve a table. I assume it&apos;s cause of the pandemic and they don&apos;t want to hold a table for a no show. Everyone was socially distanced and staffs were wearing masks so it looks like they&apos;re honoring the safety guidelines. They also checked our temperature upon arrival. I definitely don&apos;t regret coming to try the food but don&apos;t think I&apos;ll go back just because the price is too high, portion size isn&apos;t too impressive, &amp; food was just average."
5,"My FAVORITE restaurant in all of Chicago hands down! The menu changes often but always features delicious, unique flavors. All the ingredients are so fresh and crafted together so perfectly. If on the menu- the broccoli, hot dog, and duck have been some of my all time favorites! You really can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu though. For the quality of food, it&apos;s very reasonably priced and worth every penny."
5,"I&apos;ve heard quite a bit about the Purple Pig,  but never found the time to go. This morning, we decided to go to their brunch. I am glad I did as it was one of the best brunches I have ever had in the city. 

I started out with a Paloma which was expertly made. We decided to go with the charcuterie board with sopressa and duck procuttio . Both are made in house. I thought the sopressa was excellent and the duck was ok. I think I&apos;ll go with another meat next time. The cheese was outstanding, but expected. The surprising Star was the bread....mmmmmmm. This board was the real deal. This seems like the thing to get with wine! 

My group shared three dishes: Chicken and Waffles, Avocado Toast, and French omelette. The omelette was expected, but excellent. A solid dish! The surprise was the Avocado Toast  which was a guacamole with the acid coming from the olives and cucumbers. It was a weird combo, but it worked! The chicken and waffles were the best I&apos;ve ever had! The waffle was more savory than sweet which I loved. The chicken was pretty epic too! 

Yes, this place is pretty pricey, but well worth the price! I knew it was good, but I never imagined it would be THAT good! One of the best brunches I&apos;ve had in Chicago, no question!"
5,"The milk braised pork shoulder is one of the best dishes I have had in Chicago. Bone marrow is also a must, the presentation was incredible and makes for a fun food-sharing experience. At least 3-4 dishes for two people."
5,A great place to stop by in Chicago. Try to reserve a table ahead of time to make sure you don&apos;t have to wait an hour or more. Definitely great service and good recommendations. Will definitely come back to try new things next time!
4,"Only came here for happy hour, but had a good experience.  My friends and I sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and attentive.  It was quiet when we arrived, but filled up after work (this was pre-COVID precautions).  Their happy hours specials were a good deal, and also tasted good.  The food menu looked good, so I would love to go back at some time to try a good meal (or at least happy hour with some appetizers)."
5,"Great menu, great service, unique food! A real treat! Will be back! This is an innovative, very creative menu."
4,"FOOD: Tapas with a heavy emphasis on MEAT. The COVID menu is a bit smaller than what I remembered from my last visit, but they had a great cheese/charcuterie selection (including a prosciutto duck!) and fan favorites pork shoulder and belly. The food is rich and full and the flavors are certainly not what you would expect from typical tapas 

SERVICE: Prompt service with great attitudes. No issues here

EXPERIENCE: The new location has multiple indoor seating options as well as a patio out back

VALUE: Deceiving large portion sizes. Between two people, we had two appetizers and two entrees and had enough for a full meals worth of left overs. Appetizers are about $10-15 and entrees $20-35

SUMMARY: Amazing meats and intriguing menu. This place is a classic and well worth the wait. Have come back multiple times and will continue to do so in the future"
5,"If you are looking for a good wine and tapas place in Chicago this is the way to go!! 

We came here on a Sunday morning around 11:30am and it wasn&apos;t too busy. The service was great and our server told us how it works here as it&apos;s mostly shared plates so about 5 plates was good for the 4 of us. 

We ordered:
crispy pig ears - these were way too salty for my taste but I liked the crunch
ricotta gnocchi-so cheesy and decadent but definitely heavy!
the bacon and liver pate-this was my absolute fav!!! It was so tasty
the pork belly-so tender and fatty with a really good sauce
The rib hash off the brunch menu-I loved that it came with an egg and the rib meat was tender.

Really good shared plates and they had a good selection of wine and cocktails!"
5,"Our company had a small corporate party (just around 8 people) and we&apos;ve decided to check out the Purple pig. And it was absolutely awesome decision as the food is very delicious, pork was crispy and tasty. They also have a good  wine menu. Everyone got satisfied of that evening.
And what is also important, the staff wear masks"
4,"I came here for dinner after a show during peak dinner hours and the wait was actually a lot shorter than I expected. I left my name and walked around and I got a notification about 15mins that my table was ready. The atmosphere is casual and loud. The seating was a bit tight and my table was very close to the tables beside me. 

FOOD:
In terms of food, I enjoyed most of the dishes I had. My favorites included the octopus and the bucatini. There was one dish that I didn&apos;t like which is the milk braised berkshire shoulder. The item seemed interesting so I decided to give it a try. The pork was tender but I didn&apos;t love the flavor profile of it. 

OVERALL:
I enjoyed most of the foods that I had and the service was great. I would highly recommend this restaurant."
5,"Not gonna lie, I&apos;m normally a non-believer in fancy cuisine, but my friend who was visiting wanted to come here, and now I can&apos;t wait to go back. We came early and enjoyed being the only guests for brunch. It&apos;s a beautiful restaurant with great service. All three dishes we tried, we liked."
5,Actually I changed my mind. Sometimes it takes time to learn what true greatness really is.
4,"TL;DR
What to order:
- Italian Feast - unfortunately it looks like they&apos;ve moved onto the &quot;Greek Feast&quot; :( - $18 per person + tax + tip

What to watch out for
- we specified 5:30 as the pickup time but they messaged us way earlier around 4pm to come pickup the food; when we got the food it was still somewhat warm but I don&apos;t understand why they didn&apos;t stick to the specified time...

=====

Ordered the Italian feast for 2 a couple weeks ago using Tock and it was really good! It comes with chicken cacciatore with potatoes; a salad with goat cheese, beets, and roasted asparagus; and a baked pasta with cheese and pork neckbone gravy. 

The highlights were definitely the chicken in the cacciatore, the asparagus in the salad, and the pasta was really good as a whole! The chicken fell off the bone and was extremely tender, the pasta was perfectly al dente, and everything in general was very flavorful. The portion sizes were fine and we spread out all the food across maybe two-ish meals each. They give you one salad box per person but everything else just comes in one container.

Some lowlights were that in the 2-person portion we got maybe 3 or so pieces of chicken and a lot of potato. The salad&apos;s dressing was also quite sweet, but as far as salads go, I mean, it was fine (I don&apos;t eat salads for the taste, I&apos;m afraid).

Overall I would love to try their other takeout options! ~$20 per person for the Purple Pig is a pretty darned good deal compared to their normal prices, and for the quality of food you get. Only docking a star for the pickup time snafu."
3,Perhaps they had an off night. Everything was... good... but modes not compare to places down south.
5,"On my 35th birthday I finally got to try The Purple Pig after all these years. Every time I&apos;ve gone in the past, I haven&apos;t had any luck because they usually don&apos;t take reservations and the wait was always so long; however, because of COVID-19, they are now taking reservations!

They definitely lived up to the hype after all these years and I was super happy with all the menu items we ordered. My favorite dish was the crispy pig ears with kale. It was like having elevated Chicharrón with crispy kale. The pickled banana peppers added the proper amount of acidity and the yolk from the fried egg soaked up all the flavors perfectly.

If you&apos;re looking for comfort food, the milk braise pork shoulder provided all of that. The gravy was mind blowing! Throw in some great cocktails and wine pairings and The Purple Pig is the perfect casual-chic restaurant for tourists and locals alike! You can&apos;t go wrong with any menu item here!"
5,"We came here to celebrate our anniversary. This place is known for long wait times and not allowing reservations. Not luckily, but luckily because of COVID, they are currently doing reservations. So we&apos;re able to walk in with our reservation and get a table right away. I will admit, this place was very casual and I felt like we were over dressed. They were very professional throughout the night and did really great explaining every dish and giving directions on how to eat the food so you can get the best taste out of each dish. Jimmy Bannos Jr. even stopped by our table to talk a little bit and made sure we were enjoying our night. 

We started off our night with a couple of drinks. My wife ordered their &quot;Paloma&quot; and I was feeling rich and magical that night and ordered their &quot;24 Carrot Magic.&quot; The Paloma was a simple classic made with Espolon blanco tequila, lime juice and grapefruit soda. It&apos;s really hard to get this one wrong. Definitely tasty. The 24 carrot Magic was something different. This one came with corazon reposado tequila, ancho Reyes Chile liqueur, carrot juice, lime juice and ginger syrup. A drink with a kick of heat, thanks to the ancho Reyes Chile liqueur. Never heard of such liqueur and is now on my list of things to buy! The carrot juice was overpower and made the drink taste healthy. I just wish they had the wider selection of drinks, the at least the drinks we both got were fantastic. 

We started off with their Crispy Pigs Ear and ended up with a total of four entries plus dessert. 

Crispy Pigs Ear-This seems to be a very popular dish. It&apos;s served with salty crispy pigs ear, mixed with kale, and pickled banana peppers and topped with a fried egg. You must break the yolk so it serves as a dressing to the pigs ear and mix it all together. If you just eat the pigs ear by itself, it will be too salty. The egg, kale and banana peppers helps balance all the flavors. Not sure if I&apos;d get this again though. 

Chicken thigh kebabs-You get two perfectly seasoned chicken kebabs on top of four fried smashed potatoes with Tzatziki sauce at the bottom. The chicken was very tender and went perfectly with their tasty tzatziki sauce. The potatoes we&apos;re good and worked as a starchy filler. The dish was tasty but $20 for two chicken kebabs was a tad bit much. Wouldn&apos;t mind ordering again, but would probably try some other plates next time.

Some reviews mentioned that the portions are small but we had more than enough food and walked out very full.
I am not sure if this is worth the hype or the wait in the pre-covid period, but I thought the prices are relatively reasonable for the quality of food and there are many good options. Perhaps not the best in Chicago, but definitely the best in River North around Michigan Ave :)"
5,"Great place! 
Quite tasty and very affordable! Recently my friend and I went to this amazing restaurant. We ordered their best-seller food, and we were so pleased to find it wonderful! It was really tasty.  Both of us were pleased with the food and the operation. 
Thank you very much to all of you, guys!"
5,"We celebrated our anniversary in Chicago and one of our favorite spots was the Purple Pig. We were sad that it was just the two of us, because we wanted to order one of everything on the menu, but that would turn us into the purple pigs, so we went with a few favorites. The wait was minimal, and gave us a chance to sample some cheese and wine before we dined.

The dishes are rich and full of flavor, but we would have licked the plates if it wasn&apos;t rude to do in public-ha!

Some of our favorites were the Spanish octopus, pork jowl, pork liver pate, salt beets, and scallops. We kept seeing the turkey leg go by, but were so full, we couldn&apos;t make it work. Oh well, I guess we have to go back."
3,"Service was good. And food was okay. Their portions weren&apos;t very impressive &amp; the cost is quite high. I noticed they move their restaurant. I&apos;ve heard such great things about this restaurant and although food was good; it just wasn&apos;t THAT good. They have a $20 non refundable deposit to reserve a table. I assume it&apos;s cause of the pandemic and they don&apos;t want to hold a table for a no show. Everyone was socially distanced and staffs were wearing masks so it looks like they&apos;re honoring the safety guidelines. They also checked our temperature upon arrival. I definitely don&apos;t regret coming to try the food but don&apos;t think I&apos;ll go back just because the price is too high, portion size isn&apos;t too impressive, &amp; food was just average."
5,"My FAVORITE restaurant in all of Chicago hands down! The menu changes often but always features delicious, unique flavors. All the ingredients are so fresh and crafted together so perfectly. If on the menu- the broccoli, hot dog, and duck have been some of my all time favorites! You really can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu though. For the quality of food, it&apos;s very reasonably priced and worth every penny."
5,"I&apos;ve heard quite a bit about the Purple Pig,  but never found the time to go. This morning, we decided to go to their brunch. I am glad I did as it was one of the best brunches I have ever had in the city. 

I started out with a Paloma which was expertly made. We decided to go with the charcuterie board with sopressa and duck procuttio . Both are made in house. I thought the sopressa was excellent and the duck was ok. I think I&apos;ll go with another meat next time. The cheese was outstanding, but expected. The surprising Star was the bread....mmmmmmm. This board was the real deal. This seems like the thing to get with wine! 

My group shared three dishes: Chicken and Waffles, Avocado Toast, and French omelette. The omelette was expected, but excellent. A solid dish! The surprise was the Avocado Toast  which was a guacamole with the acid coming from the olives and cucumbers. It was a weird combo, but it worked! The chicken and waffles were the best I&apos;ve ever had! The waffle was more savory than sweet which I loved. The chicken was pretty epic too! 

Yes, this place is pretty pricey, but well worth the price! I knew it was good, but I never imagined it would be THAT good! One of the best brunches I&apos;ve had in Chicago, no question!"
5,"The milk braised pork shoulder is one of the best dishes I have had in Chicago. Bone marrow is also a must, the presentation was incredible and makes for a fun food-sharing experience. At least 3-4 dishes for two people."
5,A great place to stop by in Chicago. Try to reserve a table ahead of time to make sure you don&apos;t have to wait an hour or more. Definitely great service and good recommendations. Will definitely come back to try new things next time!
4,"Only came here for happy hour, but had a good experience.  My friends and I sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and attentive.  It was quiet when we arrived, but filled up after work (this was pre-COVID precautions).  Their happy hours specials were a good deal, and also tasted good.  The food menu looked good, so I would love to go back at some time to try a good meal (or at least happy hour with some appetizers)."
5,"Great menu, great service, unique food! A real treat! Will be back! This is an innovative, very creative menu."
4,"FOOD: Tapas with a heavy emphasis on MEAT. The COVID menu is a bit smaller than what I remembered from my last visit, but they had a great cheese/charcuterie selection (including a prosciutto duck!) and fan favorites pork shoulder and belly. The food is rich and full and the flavors are certainly not what you would expect from typical tapas 

SERVICE: Prompt service with great attitudes. No issues here

EXPERIENCE: The new location has multiple indoor seating options as well as a patio out back

VALUE: Deceiving large portion sizes. Between two people, we had two appetizers and two entrees and had enough for a full meals worth of left overs. Appetizers are about $10-15 and entrees $20-35

SUMMARY: Amazing meats and intriguing menu. This place is a classic and well worth the wait. Have come back multiple times and will continue to do so in the future"
5,"If you are looking for a good wine and tapas place in Chicago this is the way to go!! 

We came here on a Sunday morning around 11:30am and it wasn&apos;t too busy. The service was great and our server told us how it works here as it&apos;s mostly shared plates so about 5 plates was good for the 4 of us. 

We ordered:
crispy pig ears - these were way too salty for my taste but I liked the crunch
ricotta gnocchi-so cheesy and decadent but definitely heavy!
the bacon and liver pate-this was my absolute fav!!! It was so tasty
the pork belly-so tender and fatty with a really good sauce
The rib hash off the brunch menu-I loved that it came with an egg and the rib meat was tender.

Really good shared plates and they had a good selection of wine and cocktails!"
5,"Our company had a small corporate party (just around 8 people) and we&apos;ve decided to check out the Purple pig. And it was absolutely awesome decision as the food is very delicious, pork was crispy and tasty. They also have a good  wine menu. Everyone got satisfied of that evening.
And what is also important, the staff wear masks"
4,"I came here for dinner after a show during peak dinner hours and the wait was actually a lot shorter than I expected. I left my name and walked around and I got a notification about 15mins that my table was ready. The atmosphere is casual and loud. The seating was a bit tight and my table was very close to the tables beside me. 

FOOD:
In terms of food, I enjoyed most of the dishes I had. My favorites included the octopus and the bucatini. There was one dish that I didn&apos;t like which is the milk braised berkshire shoulder. The item seemed interesting so I decided to give it a try. The pork was tender but I didn&apos;t love the flavor profile of it. 

OVERALL:
I enjoyed most of the foods that I had and the service was great. I would highly recommend this restaurant."
5,"Not gonna lie, I&apos;m normally a non-believer in fancy cuisine, but my friend who was visiting wanted to come here, and now I can&apos;t wait to go back. We came early and enjoyed being the only guests for brunch. It&apos;s a beautiful restaurant with great service. All three dishes we tried, we liked."
5,Actually I changed my mind. Sometimes it takes time to learn what true greatness really is.
4,"TL;DR
What to order:
- Italian Feast - unfortunately it looks like they&apos;ve moved onto the &quot;Greek Feast&quot; :( - $18 per person + tax + tip

What to watch out for
- we specified 5:30 as the pickup time but they messaged us way earlier around 4pm to come pickup the food; when we got the food it was still somewhat warm but I don&apos;t understand why they didn&apos;t stick to the specified time...

=====

Ordered the Italian feast for 2 a couple weeks ago using Tock and it was really good! It comes with chicken cacciatore with potatoes; a salad with goat cheese, beets, and roasted asparagus; and a baked pasta with cheese and pork neckbone gravy. 

The highlights were definitely the chicken in the cacciatore, the asparagus in the salad, and the pasta was really good as a whole! The chicken fell off the bone and was extremely tender, the pasta was perfectly al dente, and everything in general was very flavorful. The portion sizes were fine and we spread out all the food across maybe two-ish meals each. They give you one salad box per person but everything else just comes in one container.

Some lowlights were that in the 2-person portion we got maybe 3 or so pieces of chicken and a lot of potato. The salad&apos;s dressing was also quite sweet, but as far as salads go, I mean, it was fine (I don&apos;t eat salads for the taste, I&apos;m afraid).

Overall I would love to try their other takeout options! ~$20 per person for the Purple Pig is a pretty darned good deal compared to their normal prices, and for the quality of food you get. Only docking a star for the pickup time snafu."
3,Perhaps they had an off night. Everything was... good... but modes not compare to places down south.
5,"On my 35th birthday I finally got to try The Purple Pig after all these years. Every time I&apos;ve gone in the past, I haven&apos;t had any luck because they usually don&apos;t take reservations and the wait was always so long; however, because of COVID-19, they are now taking reservations!

They definitely lived up to the hype after all these years and I was super happy with all the menu items we ordered. My favorite dish was the crispy pig ears with kale. It was like having elevated Chicharrón with crispy kale. The pickled banana peppers added the proper amount of acidity and the yolk from the fried egg soaked up all the flavors perfectly.

If you&apos;re looking for comfort food, the milk braise pork shoulder provided all of that. The gravy was mind blowing! Throw in some great cocktails and wine pairings and The Purple Pig is the perfect casual-chic restaurant for tourists and locals alike! You can&apos;t go wrong with any menu item here!"
5,"We came here to celebrate our anniversary. This place is known for long wait times and not allowing reservations. Not luckily, but luckily because of COVID, they are currently doing reservations. So we&apos;re able to walk in with our reservation and get a table right away. I will admit, this place was very casual and I felt like we were over dressed. They were very professional throughout the night and did really great explaining every dish and giving directions on how to eat the food so you can get the best taste out of each dish. Jimmy Bannos Jr. even stopped by our table to talk a little bit and made sure we were enjoying our night. 

We started off our night with a couple of drinks. My wife ordered their &quot;Paloma&quot; and I was feeling rich and magical that night and ordered their &quot;24 Carrot Magic.&quot; The Paloma was a simple classic made with Espolon blanco tequila, lime juice and grapefruit soda. It&apos;s really hard to get this one wrong. Definitely tasty. The 24 carrot Magic was something different. This one came with corazon reposado tequila, ancho Reyes Chile liqueur, carrot juice, lime juice and ginger syrup. A drink with a kick of heat, thanks to the ancho Reyes Chile liqueur. Never heard of such liqueur and is now on my list of things to buy! The carrot juice was overpower and made the drink taste healthy. I just wish they had the wider selection of drinks, the at least the drinks we both got were fantastic. 

We started off with their Crispy Pigs Ear and ended up with a total of four entries plus dessert. 

Crispy Pigs Ear-This seems to be a very popular dish. It&apos;s served with salty crispy pigs ear, mixed with kale, and pickled banana peppers and topped with a fried egg. You must break the yolk so it serves as a dressing to the pigs ear and mix it all together. If you just eat the pigs ear by itself, it will be too salty. The egg, kale and banana peppers helps balance all the flavors. Not sure if I&apos;d get this again though. 

Chicken thigh kebabs-You get two perfectly seasoned chicken kebabs on top of four fried smashed potatoes with Tzatziki sauce at the bottom. The chicken was very tender and went perfectly with their tasty tzatziki sauce. The potatoes we&apos;re good and worked as a starchy filler. The dish was tasty but $20 for two chicken kebabs was a tad bit much. Wouldn&apos;t mind ordering again, but would probably try some other plates next time. 

Whipped Feta- This dish was tasty. It came with toast and plenty of whipped feta to spread on the toast. The whipped feta came with cucumber and marinated tomatoes. The tomatoes were very tasty and tasted sweet. I would definitely order this dish again. 

Roasted Bone Marrow- This dish was my favorite dish of the night. It came with herbs, capers and onions with a side of Maldonado sea salt. You spread the bone marrow on the toast, grab some of the salt and sprinkle it on top, and then you top it off with the greens. A perfect bite every time. I would order this dish again and again. 

For dessert we opted for their popular &quot;Sicilian Iris.&quot; I will admit by dessert time, we were already stuffed, and whenever we&apos;re completely full we skip dessert. But since it was our anniversary and since it&apos;s the Purple Pig, we had to try a little bit of everything. The Sicilian iris, was tasty. It came warm and the fried ball was huge. It came stuffed ricotta, and chocolate chip. It reminded me of a warm gooey ball version of a cannoli. I wouldn&apos;t mind ordering this again. 

Overall, The Purple Pig hype is real. Everything was phenomenal. Flaw customer service, delicious food. Will definitely be returning."
5,"I had a great time at The Purple Pig. They recently opened the outdoor so I decided to give it a try. I was lucky to get a reservation spot on Tock. The reservation does require a $20 fee which will be applied to the check, but sometimes they might forget, so you want to check the final bill. The outdoor area was very small- maybe 5-6 tables, but it was fenced off and had its own trailer bathroom. 
We ordered the duck, pork shoulder, pork belly, broccoli and sweet corn. They were all really good.
The drinks were good as the portions were generous and there were a lot of alcohol in them- which is a plus!
All the meat dishes were very tender and the vegetable dishes were really nice too. It was one of the best broccoli dishes I have tried! The pork belly was a bit fatty, but it was soft and well cooked. The pork shoulder was meaty and the gravy, mashed potato and meat all went very well together.

5,"My FAVORITE restaurant in all of Chicago hands down! The menu changes often but always features delicious, unique flavors. All the ingredients are so fresh and crafted together so perfectly. If on the menu- the broccoli, hot dog, and duck have been some of my all time favorites! You really can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu though. For the quality of food, it&apos;s very reasonably priced and worth every penny."
5,"I&apos;ve heard quite a bit about the Purple Pig,  but never found the time to go. This morning, we decided to go to their brunch. I am glad I did as it was one of the best brunches I have ever had in the city. 

I started out with a Paloma which was expertly made. We decided to go with the charcuterie board with sopressa and duck procuttio . Both are made in house. I thought the sopressa was excellent and the duck was ok. I think I&apos;ll go with another meat next time. The cheese was outstanding, but expected. The surprising Star was the bread....mmmmmmm. This board was the real deal. This seems like the thing to get with wine! 

My group shared three dishes: Chicken and Waffles, Avocado Toast, and French omelette. The omelette was expected, but excellent. A solid dish! The surprise was the Avocado Toast  which was a guacamole with the acid coming from the olives and cucumbers. It was a weird combo, but it worked! The chicken and waffles were the best I&apos;ve ever had! The waffle was more savory than sweet which I loved. The chicken was pretty epic too! 

Yes, this place is pretty pricey, but well worth the price! I knew it was good, but I never imagined it would be THAT good! One of the best brunches I&apos;ve had in Chicago, no question!"
5,"The milk braised pork shoulder is one of the best dishes I have had in Chicago. Bone marrow is also a must, the presentation was incredible and makes for a fun food-sharing experience. At least 3-4 dishes for two people."
5,A great place to stop by in Chicago. Try to reserve a table ahead of time to make sure you don&apos;t have to wait an hour or more. Definitely great service and good recommendations. Will definitely come back to try new things next time!
4,"Only came here for happy hour, but had a good experience.  My friends and I sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and attentive.  It was quiet when we arrived, but filled up after work (this was pre-COVID precautions).  Their happy hours specials were a good deal, and also tasted good.  The food menu looked good, so I would love to go back at some time to try a good meal (or at least happy hour with some appetizers)."
5,"Great menu, great service, unique food! A real treat! Will be back! This is an innovative, very creative menu."
4,"FOOD: Tapas with a heavy emphasis on MEAT. The COVID menu is a bit smaller than what I remembered from my last visit, but they had a great cheese/charcuterie selection (including a prosciutto duck!) and fan favorites pork shoulder and belly. The food is rich and full and the flavors are certainly not what you would expect from typical tapas 

SERVICE: Prompt service with great attitudes. No issues here

EXPERIENCE: The new location has multiple indoor seating options as well as a patio out back

VALUE: Deceiving large portion sizes. Between two people, we had two appetizers and two entrees and had enough for a full meals worth of left overs. Appetizers are about $10-15 and entrees $20-35

SUMMARY: Amazing meats and intriguing menu. This place is a classic and well worth the wait. Have come back multiple times and will continue to do so in the future"
5,"If you are looking for a good wine and tapas place in Chicago this is the way to go!! 

We came here on a Sunday morning around 11:30am and it wasn&apos;t too busy. The service was great and our server told us how it works here as it&apos;s mostly shared plates so about 5 plates was good for the 4 of us. 

We ordered:
crispy pig ears - these were way too salty for my taste but I liked the crunch
ricotta gnocchi-so cheesy and decadent but definitely heavy!
the bacon and liver pate-this was my absolute fav!!! It was so tasty
the pork belly-so tender and fatty with a really good sauce
The rib hash off the brunch menu-I loved that it came with an egg and the rib meat was tender.

Really good shared plates and they had a good selection of wine and cocktails!"
5,"Our company had a small corporate party (just around 8 people) and we&apos;ve decided to check out the Purple pig. And it was absolutely awesome decision as the food is very delicious, pork was crispy and tasty. They also have a good  wine menu. Everyone got satisfied of that evening.
And what is also important, the staff wear masks"
4,"I came here for dinner after a show during peak dinner hours and the wait was actually a lot shorter than I expected. I left my name and walked around and I got a notification about 15mins that my table was ready. The atmosphere is casual and loud. The seating was a bit tight and my table was very close to the tables beside me. 

FOOD:
In terms of food, I enjoyed most of the dishes I had. My favorites included the octopus and the bucatini. There was one dish that I didn&apos;t like which is the milk braised berkshire shoulder. The item seemed interesting so I decided to give it a try. The pork was tender but I didn&apos;t love the flavor profile of it. 

OVERALL:
I enjoyed most of the foods that I had and the service was great. I would highly recommend this restaurant."
5,"Not gonna lie, I&apos;m normally a non-believer in fancy cuisine, but my friend who was visiting wanted to come here, and now I can&apos;t wait to go back. We came early and enjoyed being the only guests for brunch. It&apos;s a beautiful restaurant with great service. All three dishes we tried, we liked."
5,Actually I changed my mind. Sometimes it takes time to learn what true greatness really is.
4,"TL;DR
What to order:
- Italian Feast - unfortunately it looks like they&apos;ve moved onto the &quot;Greek Feast&quot; :( - $18 per person + tax + tip

What to watch out for
- we specified 5:30 as the pickup time but they messaged us way earlier around 4pm to come pickup the food; when we got the food it was still somewhat warm but I don&apos;t understand why they didn&apos;t stick to the specified time...

=====

Ordered the Italian feast for 2 a couple weeks ago using Tock and it was really good! It comes with chicken cacciatore with potatoes; a salad with goat cheese, beets, and roasted asparagus; and a baked pasta with cheese and pork neckbone gravy. 

The highlights were definitely the chicken in the cacciatore, the asparagus in the salad, and the pasta was really good as a whole! The chicken fell off the bone and was extremely tender, the pasta was perfectly al dente, and everything in general was very flavorful. The portion sizes were fine and we spread out all the food across maybe two-ish meals each. They give you one salad box per person but everything else just comes in one container.

Some lowlights were that in the 2-person portion we got maybe 3 or so pieces of chicken and a lot of potato. The salad&apos;s dressing was also quite sweet, but as far as salads go, I mean, it was fine (I don&apos;t eat salads for the taste, I&apos;m afraid).

Overall I would love to try their other takeout options! ~$20 per person for the Purple Pig is a pretty darned good deal compared to their normal prices, and for the quality of food you get. Only docking a star for the pickup time snafu."
3,Perhaps they had an off night. Everything was... good... but modes not compare to places down south.
5,"On my 35th birthday I finally got to try The Purple Pig after all these years. Every time I&apos;ve gone in the past, I haven&apos;t had any luck because they usually don&apos;t take reservations and the wait was always so long; however, because of COVID-19, they are now taking reservations!

They definitely lived up to the hype after all these years and I was super happy with all the menu items we ordered. My favorite dish was the crispy pig ears with kale. It was like having elevated Chicharrón with crispy kale. The pickled banana peppers added the proper amount of acidity and the yolk from the fried egg soaked up all the flavors perfectly.

If you&apos;re looking for comfort food, the milk braise pork shoulder provided all of that. The gravy was mind blowing! Throw in some great cocktails and wine pairings and The Purple Pig is the perfect casual-chic restaurant for tourists and locals alike! You can&apos;t go wrong with any menu item here!"
5,"We came here to celebrate our anniversary. This place is known for long wait times and not allowing reservations. Not luckily, but luckily because of COVID, they are currently doing reservations. So we&apos;re able to walk in with our reservation and get a table right away. I will admit, this place was very casual and I felt like we were over dressed. They were very professional throughout the night and did really great explaining every dish and giving directions on how to eat the food so you can get the best taste out of each dish. Jimmy Bannos Jr. even stopped by our table to talk a little bit and made sure we were enjoying our night. 

We started off our night with a couple of drinks. My wife ordered their &quot;Paloma&quot; and I was feeling rich and magical that night and ordered their &quot;24 Carrot Magic.&quot; The Paloma was a simple classic made with Espolon blanco tequila, lime juice and grapefruit soda. It&apos;s really hard to get this one wrong. Definitely tasty. The 24 carrot Magic was something different. This one came with corazon reposado tequila, ancho Reyes Chile liqueur, carrot juice, lime juice and ginger syrup. A drink with a kick of heat, thanks to the ancho Reyes Chile liqueur. Never heard of such liqueur and is now on my list of things to buy! The carrot juice was overpower and made the drink taste healthy. I just wish they had the wider selection of drinks, the at least the drinks we both got were fantastic. 

We started off with their Crispy Pigs Ear and ended up with a total of four entries plus dessert. 

Crispy Pigs Ear-This seems to be a very popular dish. It&apos;s served with salty crispy pigs ear, mixed with kale, and pickled banana peppers and topped with a fried egg. You must break the yolk so it serves as a dressing to the pigs ear and mix it all together. If you just eat the pigs ear by itself, it will be too salty. The egg, kale and banana peppers helps balance all the flavors. Not sure if I&apos;d get this again though. 

Chicken thigh kebabs-You get two perfectly seasoned chicken kebabs on top of four fried smashed potatoes with Tzatziki sauce at the bottom. The chicken was very tender and went perfectly with their tasty tzatziki sauce. The potatoes we&apos;re good and worked as a starchy filler. The dish was tasty but $20 for two chicken kebabs was a tad bit much. Wouldn&apos;t mind ordering again, but would probably try some other plates next time. 

Whipped Feta- This dish was tasty. It came with toast and plenty of whipped feta to spread on the toast. The whipped feta came with cucumber and marinated tomatoes. The tomatoes were very tasty and tasted sweet. I would definitely order this dish again. 

Roasted Bone Marrow- This dish was my favorite dish of the night. It came with herbs, capers and onions with a side of Maldonado sea salt. You spread the bone marrow on the toast, grab some of the salt and sprinkle it on top, and then you top it off with the greens. A perfect bite every time. I would order this dish again and again. 

For dessert we opted for their popular &quot;Sicilian Iris.&quot; I will admit by dessert time, we were already stuffed, and whenever we&apos;re completely full we skip dessert. But since it was our anniversary and since it&apos;s the Purple Pig, we had to try a little bit of everything. The Sicilian iris, was tasty. It came warm and the fried ball was huge. It came stuffed ricotta, and chocolate chip. It reminded me of a warm gooey ball version of a cannoli. I wouldn&apos;t mind ordering this again. 

Overall, The Purple Pig hype is real. Everything was phenomenal. Flaw customer service, delicious food. Will definitely be returning."
5,"I had a great time at The Purple Pig. They recently opened the outdoor so I decided to give it a try. I was lucky to get a reservation spot on Tock. The reservation does require a $20 fee which will be applied to the check, but sometimes they might forget, so you want to check the final bill. The outdoor area was very small- maybe 5-6 tables, but it was fenced off and had its own trailer bathroom. 
We ordered the duck, pork shoulder, pork belly, broccoli and sweet corn. They were all really good.
The drinks were good as the portions were generous and there were a lot of alcohol in them- which is a plus!
All the meat dishes were very tender and the vegetable dishes were really nice too. It was one of the best broccoli dishes I have tried! The pork belly was a bit fatty, but it was soft and well cooked. The pork shoulder was meaty and the gravy, mashed potato and meat all went very well together.
The duck was massive, but still very soft and juicy. 
Some reviews mentioned that the portions are small but we had more than enough food and walked out very full.
I am not sure if this is worth the hype or the wait in the pre-covid period, but I thought the prices are relatively reasonable for the quality of food and there are many good options. Perhaps not the best in Chicago, but definitely the best in River North around Michigan Ave :)"
5,"Great place! 
Quite tasty and very affordable! Recently my friend and I went to this amazing restaurant. We ordered their best-seller food, and we were so pleased to find it wonderful! It was really tasty.  Both of us were pleased with the food and the operation. 
Thank you very much to all of you, guys!"
5,"We celebrated our anniversary in Chicago and one of our favorite spots was the Purple Pig. We were sad that it was just the two of us, because we wanted to order one of everything on the menu, but that would turn us into the purple pigs, so we went with a few favorites. The wait was minimal, and gave us a chance to sample some cheese and wine before we dined.

The dishes are rich and full of flavor, but we would have licked the plates if it wasn&apos;t rude to do in public-ha!

Some of our favorites were the Spanish octopus, pork jowl, pork liver pate, salt beets, and scallops. We kept seeing the turkey leg go by, but were so full, we couldn&apos;t make it work. Oh well, I guess we have to go back."
3,"Service was good. And food was okay. Their portions weren&apos;t very impressive &amp; the cost is quite high. I noticed they move their restaurant. I&apos;ve heard such great things about this restaurant and although food was good; it just wasn&apos;t THAT good. They have a $20 non refundable deposit to reserve a table. I assume it&apos;s cause of the pandemic and they don&apos;t want to hold a table for a no show. Everyone was socially distanced and staffs were wearing masks so it looks like they&apos;re honoring the safety guidelines. They also checked our temperature upon arrival. I definitely don&apos;t regret coming to try the food but don&apos;t think I&apos;ll go back just because the price is too high, portion size isn&apos;t too impressive, &amp; food was just average."

5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."

4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"

5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."

We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"

The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer!

4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."

The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."

We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"

The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer!

4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."

The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."

We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"

The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer!

4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."

The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."

We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"

The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer!

4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."

The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."

We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"

The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer!

4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."

The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."

We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"

The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer!

4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."

The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."

We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"

The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer!

4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."

The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
