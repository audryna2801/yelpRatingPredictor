4,"I kinda want to give 3.5 stars? But rounding up. 

I got takeout today for the first time and tried the vegetarian hell ramen at the standard level. I think next time I would have gotten spicier. The broth was good and I liked that most of the ramens had veggie options! Most ramen places only have one. However, I wish the ramen had tofu or something substantial. Also the noodles were all clumped together so it was hard to eat after pouring in the broth because it was so solid. After it warmed up and de solidified it was tasty but some noodle chewing to start. Maybe it&apos;s different in person."
4,"There is a very good ramen shop in Hyde Park that offers good delivery!

The noodles are great. The tonkotsu broth is superlative -- rich, savory, satisfying, just a hint of sweetness. I can quibble with the quantity and interest of some of the toppings, though I will never tire of the medium-boiled soy-cured eggs. 

But the most important thing is that this is a very good ramen shop in Hyde Park that offers good delivery! Why quibble?"
5,"TL;DR - This location is excellent; love the decor, great service, and food.

 The ramen was just what the doctor ordered -  depths of flavor,  that pork bone broth had a wonderful umami note, with just enough spice to break into a slight sweat.   

In this era of pandemics , patrons are spaced out, and signs detailing mask etiquette are displayed that ask for patrons to help ensure the safety of fellow guests and staff, which is greatly appreciated.  

I&apos;ll be back!"
5,Great food! I really enjoyed the tonkatsu ramen and pork sui gyoza. The staff are very friendly and safe with social distancing as well.
2,"I&apos;ve been dying to try Strings for years... Even though it is hot outside I want a good hot broth to slurp on:
Service: It took a minute to be acknowledged and seated by the server. Once seated I&apos;m immediately ask to place my order I told the lady I need a minute. Every question I asked the server she was very sarcastic and acted as though uuummm why are you asking me that with an attitude.

Food: I ordered the seafood &amp; kuro buta with pork belly. The broth was not hott at all not one time did I have to blow. For the cost you get 2 little shrimp 2 scallops sliced in half and shredded crab. I didn&apos;t like the flavor of the broth the corn takes over and the noodles were hard. I wrapped it up and doctored it up at home smh. Try for yourself!"
4,"Being a frequent visitor of ramen restaurants, I was pretty excited to see a new swanky ramen/Japanese restaurant open in my neighborhood. I had been to the Chinatown location several times in the past and would say that the experience is similar. Items on the menu are the same, although this location is much more spacious, bright, and less loud. 

My friends and I came around 6pm on a weeknight and there was no wait. By 7pm though, 2-3 parties were waiting for tables. We got the kuro buta tsukemen and tonkotsu, which were served within 10 minutes of ordering. Personally, I&apos;m not the biggest fan of their noodles. They are straight (not curly) and have more of an al-dente texture that feels harder to the bite than most ramen noodles. The broth was good though, very umami, not too salty, and very heavy on the sesame flavor. The tonkotsu ramen only came with one piece of meat, which was a bit underwhelming, but the rest of the bowl was good. Even though we came for ramen, I love that Strings also has great rice bowls, sashimi, and vegetarian options.

The new restaurant has a nice variety of seating and decor but service was a bit all over the place, as I expected for a new restaurant. I&apos;m sure it&apos;ll improve as they settle in business, and will definitely be back!"
4,"Rating 4.5 stars 

So excited that there is a Strings in Hyde Park now!! We came during the soft opening on a Saturday night, so it was (as expected) pretty crowded when we got there. However, the turnover was pretty fast and we only waited for about 15-20 minutes before we were seated. 

There is a pretty decent selection of vegetarian options on the menu. About half of the different types of ramen have a vegetarian option available (including the hell ramen, if that&apos;s your thing!), so I&apos;m definitely looking forward to coming back and trying them all. I ordered the vegetarian shoyu ramen, and my boyfriend ordered the turkey shio ramen because he wanted a non-pork option. 

The food came out insanely quickly, which I did not expect but am very impressed by. The presentation is really great, and I felt like the portion size was perfect -- just enough that I could finish it, but not overwhelmingly filling. Personally, I am not a huge fan of ginger, so I would ask for my ramen without any ginger on it next time, but aside from that, all the flavors were great. The noodles were cooked to a perfect consistency, and the broth was silky and smooth. 

I will definitely be returning in the future, and I would recommend trying it out!"
4,"Always COMPLETELY packed. Tried going on a friday night and there was at least a 2 hour wait. Came back the following Wednesday and it was still crowded, but since we arrived early (around 6pm) we were seated right away. Restaurant is small, so that&apos;s probably why. It also gets loud in there, so you have to talk loudly.

Server was great - very helpful answering our questions, and food came out quickly. 

We got the edamame to share (delicious) and both got yakisoba. I got the turkey and my friend got the kuro buta. The turkey was a bit dry and overcooked - I wouldn&apos;t order it again - but her kuro buta was DELICIOUS. Very tender and seasoned well. The noodles were topped with two over-easy eggs that had pepperoni in them? A bit strange, but we liked it. Portions were huge, and both of us walked away with leftovers. The yakisoba also came with a bowl of miso (??) soup. 

I&apos;ll be back to try the cat rice next!!"
4,"As someone who went to UChicago when the food scene wasn&apos;t nearly as good, this Strings location is a welcome sight. I&apos;ve ordered from Uber Eats and have been to the Strings in Chinatown many times so I&apos;m familiar with the menu and the taste of their offerings. I came here for the first time during their soft opening. The interior is pretty similar to their Chinatown location, with modular wooden tables and plants overhanging in the light fixtures. 

Both times the services was pretty questionable - it seemed like the servers were inexperienced, and it took a while for them to take our orders and give us our checks. 

Food-wise, Strings is not my favorite ramen place but it&apos;s pretty solid. I ordered the pork belt tsukemen for the first time, and it was pretty good, though I felt like the dipping broth should have been more flavorful/salty like actual ramen broth? I usually get the pork belly tonkatsu ramen, which I ordered the second time, and it had a good balance of flavors and texture of noodles, pretty much what I expected/remembered. The meat lovers rice bowl is always great too especially if you need the protein. 

Definitely will be back at some point, for lack of better food options in the area and my love for any ramen!"
3,"Strings Ramen noodles are impeccable. They are long and stiff, two essential noodle traits. They are very slurpable, and the various pork offerings are all adequate. I have been informed the vegetarian offerings are also good.

But the weirdness of Strings is in their mindless devotion to 3 rules. 

Rule 1: Nobody is ever allowed to sit chairs in the front of the restaurant. That&apos;s 1/3 of all their chairs. You could come in on crutches and wobbly ankles, and they&apos;ll still make you wait 45 minutes for a chair in the back. This is most unusual. I&apos;m used to restaurants seating me near the windows, all the better to lure in other unsuspecting customers. But Strings wants to hide their customers away. Why? 

Rule 2: You must sit at the bar or you die. This rule is an extension of the seating rigor found in the previous rule. When I arrived one wintry day with a friend, we asked to be seated in a booth. Strings associates seated us at the bar instead. We tried it, but due to our immensely weak spines from our sedentary lives, we could not stand it. We timidly asked for a booth, spotting some enticingly empty and even cushioned options. Instead, the Strings associates asked us to wait in the front for another twenty minutes where, of course, we were not allowed to sit in the empty chairs in the front 1/3 of the restaurant either (see Rule 1).

Rule 3: Under no circumstances will Strings Ramen (registered trademark) be allowed to leave the restaurant in a to-go order. Not separately, with broth in one container and noodles in another, like every other noodle shop in this city does it. Not together, with everything dissolving to mush. Not ever. Of course, with the pandemic, Rule 3 was eventually lifted. May it never return.

Still, do I continue to return, burning a hole in my stomach with each trip? Do I bring friends just to watch their pores expand and sweat drip everywhere, even onto the chopsticks? Yes, I do. I am just a gaping maw pursuing oily noodles in the winter, and I take what I can get."
2,"For takeout: Honestly, I thought this ramen was really lacking in flavor. The broth (I got the miso) was not at all what I&apos;d expect from ramen - thinner, less savory, a little bland. The pork belly was fantastic but otherwise, this is pretty subpar ramen."
5,"Accidentally wrote a bad review that was intended for a completely different restaurant, I apologize and thank you for responding to my (bad) review shows that you care.

Anyway , I moved into the Hyde park a year ago and I was excited to see that another quality ramen place was coming to the Hyde park area! I consistently walked my dog past their restaurant to see when they were going to open. On one cold day mid March weekend I walk past and saw they were open so I called my girl and we went to eat. 

A server greeted us and got us set up in a nice booth. The scenery was very calming, a nice orange/red lighting which was a cool aura. When our waiter came he introduced himself, was happy to thoroughly explain the menu and taylor what ramen we wanted to our liking. I ended up getting the Premium (Tonkotsu Ramen), cause I like everything from sea food to pork, on level 3 heat. 

We waited no more than 15 min for our food. It came piping hot, so we dressed the ramen up with sides while we talked about how good our food looked. Once we finished adding our spices and sauces,OHMYGOODNESS, every walk that I took past that place for the 4 months was worth it! So much flavor! Perfectly salty! Fresh meats and seafood! It was all there in a deliciously crafted ramen broth. Definitely top not ramen no doubt.

To be completely honest the experience really started when we walked in the door. There waiters were kind and patient. We really enjoyed their customer service and the food was the the cherry on top."
4,"I really, really like the food here. I got a simple vegetarian ramen bowl with a noodle booster, and it was delicious. I enjoyed watching the kitchen staff prepare food while I ate; perhaps that isn&apos;t everyone&apos;s cup of tea but I found it interesting and the right level of stimulation while I ate my meal. I probably will never take the Hell Ramen challenge but it&apos;s cool that they have that."
5,"This might be the best Ramen I&apos;ve had in my LIFE. Their Deluxe (or Supreme or whatever)Tonkotsu is not to be missed. I think the flavor helped me achieve nirvana. Please don&apos;t skip this place. They are knowledgeable and they really care about the food. This isn&apos;t some copy and paste Ramen spot, it&apos;s the real deal."
5,"I&apos;ve never had ramen so I was skeptical about actually trying ramen for the first time. To make the stakes higher, my wife and I ordered takeout. Surprisingly Strings nailed it!

The ramen was so good that I&apos;ve been craving it every since. 

-Noodles were good, slightly chewy if you don&apos;t let them soak in the broth long enough but I figured that this was from us ordering takeout and the broth being packaged separate from the noodles. 

-The pork belly in my ramen was amazing. Tender melt in your mouth home cooked meal good. 

-The portion is huge. I&apos;m a big guy so I was initially worried about getting full off of ramen but I was mistaken. 

-This place is a good spot for if you&apos;ve never eaten ramen and want a great experience."
5,"I have a pretty high bar when it comes to ramen, so I was impressed and pleased that Strings delivered. I read that their Tonkotsu is one of the top 15 in Chicago and have to say I agree. Really flavorful, deep broth; deliciously springy noodles; perfectly cooked rich pork; and great accompaniments like wood ear mushrooms and toasted garlic. And it traveled well via delivery, which is not always the case. This will come in extra handy over the coming cold months!"
3,"Probably the premier south side ramen shop. Enjoyable spot for Hyde Park, but if you have a real craving, I&apos;d recommend heading out to greater Chicago area. 

They put pepperoni on the yakisoba. I respect that. Shoyu ramen is decent. Don&apos;t order the rice bowls.

4,"There were things that kept this from being a five star review, none of those things are the excellent food. Starting with the food, it was most excellent. Having lived in Japan for half a decade plus I know good ramen, this is good ramen. The only thing I would change to the menu is for them to add the option to substitute in udon noodles and to add katsu sauce for the fried foods, those options are widely available in every ramen shop I ate at in Japan. My biggest problem with the restaurant was the insanely loud music. Here&apos;s a tip, it&apos;s a restaurant, not a concert hall. Turn the music down 30%, then maybe people won&apos;t have to raise their voices to have a conversation. One other thing, keeping with the Japanese theme, maybe play Japanese&apos;s music. Aside from those critiques this place is phenomenal."
4,Hyde Park needed a ramen place and Strings gets the job done. I am no ramen aficionado but as a vegetarian I found the hell ramen tasty and satisfying. However my girlfriend who had the Miso ramen found it a little bland and thought they could have added more components. The dumplings that we ordered were also a little cold in the center. The service was quick and friendly. Will probably be going back when I need my ramen fix. Happy Hyde Park has it. Also this place is BYOB so feel free to bring your own wine or beer.
5,Fan of the Chinatown location. Couldn&apos;t be happier that they opened a location here. I had the Tonkotsu w/pork belly. Very good. I recommend trying the drink &quot;stringria&quot;.

The new restaurant has a nice variety of seating and decor but service was a bit all over the place, as I expected for a new restaurant. I&apos;m sure it&apos;ll improve as they settle in business, and will definitely be back!"
4,"Rating 4.5 stars 

So excited that there is a Strings in Hyde Park now!! We came during the soft opening on a Saturday night, so it was (as expected) pretty crowded when we got there. However, the turnover was pretty fast and we only waited for about 15-20 minutes before we were seated. 

There is a pretty decent selection of vegetarian options on the menu. About half of the different types of ramen have a vegetarian option available (including the hell ramen, if that&apos;s your thing!), so I&apos;m definitely looking forward to coming back and trying them all. I ordered the vegetarian shoyu ramen, and my boyfriend ordered the turkey shio ramen because he wanted a non-pork option. 

The food came out insanely quickly, which I did not expect but am very impressed by. The presentation is really great, and I felt like the portion size was perfect -- just enough that I could finish it, but not overwhelmingly filling. Personally, I am not a huge fan of ginger, so I would ask for my ramen without any ginger on it next time, but aside from that, all the flavors were great. The noodles were cooked to a perfect consistency, and the broth was silky and smooth. 

I will definitely be returning in the future, and I would recommend trying it out!"
4,"Always COMPLETELY packed. Tried going on a friday night and there was at least a 2 hour wait. Came back the following Wednesday and it was still crowded, but since we arrived early (around 6pm) we were seated right away. Restaurant is small, so that&apos;s probably why. It also gets loud in there, so you have to talk loudly.

Server was great - very helpful answering our questions, and food came out quickly. 

We got the edamame to share (delicious) and both got yakisoba. I got the turkey and my friend got the kuro buta. The turkey was a bit dry and overcooked - I wouldn&apos;t order it again - but her kuro buta was DELICIOUS. Very tender and seasoned well. The noodles were topped with two over-easy eggs that had pepperoni in them? A bit strange, but we liked it. Portions were huge, and both of us walked away with leftovers. The yakisoba also came with a bowl of miso (??) soup. 

I&apos;ll be back to try the cat rice next!!"
4,"As someone who went to UChicago when the food scene wasn&apos;t nearly as good, this Strings location is a welcome sight. I&apos;ve ordered from Uber Eats and have been to the Strings in Chinatown many times so I&apos;m familiar with the menu and the taste of their offerings. I came here for the first time during their soft opening. The interior is pretty similar to their Chinatown location, with modular wooden tables and plants overhanging in the light fixtures. 

Both times the services was pretty questionable - it seemed like the servers were inexperienced, and it took a while for them to take our orders and give us our checks. 

Food-wise, Strings is not my favorite ramen place but it&apos;s pretty solid. I ordered the pork belt tsukemen for the first time, and it was pretty good, though I felt like the dipping broth should have been more flavorful/salty like actual ramen broth? I usually get the pork belly tonkatsu ramen, which I ordered the second time, and it had a good balance of flavors and texture of noodles, pretty much what I expected/remembered. The meat lovers rice bowl is always great too especially if you need the protein. 

Definitely will be back at some point, for lack of better food options in the area and my love for any ramen!"
3,"Strings Ramen noodles are impeccable. They are long and stiff, two essential noodle traits. They are very slurpable, and the various pork offerings are all adequate. I have been informed the vegetarian offerings are also good.

But the weirdness of Strings is in their mindless devotion to 3 rules. 

Rule 1: Nobody is ever allowed to sit chairs in the front of the restaurant. That&apos;s 1/3 of all their chairs. You could come in on crutches and wobbly ankles, and they&apos;ll still make you wait 45 minutes for a chair in the back. This is most unusual. I&apos;m used to restaurants seating me near the windows, all the better to lure in other unsuspecting customers. But Strings wants to hide their customers away. Why? 

Rule 2: You must sit at the bar or you die. This rule is an extension of the seating rigor found in the previous rule. When I arrived one wintry day with a friend, we asked to be seated in a booth. Strings associates seated us at the bar instead. We tried it, but due to our immensely weak spines from our sedentary lives, we could not stand it. We timidly asked for a booth, spotting some enticingly empty and even cushioned options. Instead, the Strings associates asked us to wait in the front for another twenty minutes where, of course, we were not allowed to sit in the empty chairs in the front 1/3 of the restaurant either (see Rule 1).

Rule 3: Under no circumstances will Strings Ramen (registered trademark) be allowed to leave the restaurant in a to-go order. Not separately, with broth in one container and noodles in another, like every other noodle shop in this city does it. Not together, with everything dissolving to mush. Not ever. Of course, with the pandemic, Rule 3 was eventually lifted. May it never return.

Still, do I continue to return, burning a hole in my stomach with each trip? Do I bring friends just to watch their pores expand and sweat drip everywhere, even onto the chopsticks? Yes, I do. I am just a gaping maw pursuing oily noodles in the winter, and I take what I can get."
2,"For takeout: Honestly, I thought this ramen was really lacking in flavor. The broth (I got the miso) was not at all what I&apos;d expect from ramen - thinner, less savory, a little bland. The pork belly was fantastic but otherwise, this is pretty subpar ramen."
5,"Accidentally wrote a bad review that was intended for a completely different restaurant, I apologize and thank you for responding to my (bad) review shows that you care.

Anyway , I moved into the Hyde park a year ago and I was excited to see that another quality ramen place was coming to the Hyde park area! I consistently walked my dog past their restaurant to see when they were going to open. On one cold day mid March weekend I walk past and saw they were open so I called my girl and we went to eat. 

A server greeted us and got us set up in a nice booth. The scenery was very calming, a nice orange/red lighting which was a cool aura. When our waiter came he introduced himself, was happy to thoroughly explain the menu and taylor what ramen we wanted to our liking. I ended up getting the Premium (Tonkotsu Ramen), cause I like everything from sea food to pork, on level 3 heat. 

We waited no more than 15 min for our food. It came piping hot, so we dressed the ramen up with sides while we talked about how good our food looked. Once we finished adding our spices and sauces,OHMYGOODNESS, every walk that I took past that place for the 4 months was worth it! So much flavor! Perfectly salty! Fresh meats and seafood! It was all there in a deliciously crafted ramen broth. Definitely top not ramen no doubt.

To be completely honest the experience really started when we walked in the door. There waiters were kind and patient. We really enjoyed their customer service and the food was the the cherry on top."
4,"I really, really like the food here. I got a simple vegetarian ramen bowl with a noodle booster, and it was delicious. I enjoyed watching the kitchen staff prepare food while I ate; perhaps that isn&apos;t everyone&apos;s cup of tea but I found it interesting and the right level of stimulation while I ate my meal. I probably will never take the Hell Ramen challenge but it&apos;s cool that they have that."
5,"This might be the best Ramen I&apos;ve had in my LIFE. Their Deluxe (or Supreme or whatever)Tonkotsu is not to be missed. I think the flavor helped me achieve nirvana. Please don&apos;t skip this place. They are knowledgeable and they really care about the food. This isn&apos;t some copy and paste Ramen spot, it&apos;s the real deal."
5,"I&apos;ve never had ramen so I was skeptical about actually trying ramen for the first time. To make the stakes higher, my wife and I ordered takeout. Surprisingly Strings nailed it!

The ramen was so good that I&apos;ve been craving it every since. 

-Noodles were good, slightly chewy if you don&apos;t let them soak in the broth long enough but I figured that this was from us ordering takeout and the broth being packaged separate from the noodles. 

-The pork belly in my ramen was amazing. Tender melt in your mouth home cooked meal good. 

-The portion is huge. I&apos;m a big guy so I was initially worried about getting full off of ramen but I was mistaken. 

-This place is a good spot for if you&apos;ve never eaten ramen and want a great experience."
5,"I have a pretty high bar when it comes to ramen, so I was impressed and pleased that Strings delivered. I read that their Tonkotsu is one of the top 15 in Chicago and have to say I agree. Really flavorful, deep broth; deliciously springy noodles; perfectly cooked rich pork; and great accompaniments like wood ear mushrooms and toasted garlic. And it traveled well via delivery, which is not always the case. This will come in extra handy over the coming cold months!"
3,"Probably the premier south side ramen shop. Enjoyable spot for Hyde Park, but if you have a real craving, I&apos;d recommend heading out to greater Chicago area. 

They put pepperoni on the yakisoba. I respect that. Shoyu ramen is decent. Don&apos;t order the rice bowls.

Send me noods
No strings attached
Slurp slurp"
4,"There were things that kept this from being a five star review, none of those things are the excellent food. Starting with the food, it was most excellent. Having lived in Japan for half a decade plus I know good ramen, this is good ramen. The only thing I would change to the menu is for them to add the option to substitute in udon noodles and to add katsu sauce for the fried foods, those options are widely available in every ramen shop I ate at in Japan. My biggest problem with the restaurant was the insanely loud music. Here&apos;s a tip, it&apos;s a restaurant, not a concert hall. Turn the music down 30%, then maybe people won&apos;t have to raise their voices to have a conversation. One other thing, keeping with the Japanese theme, maybe play Japanese&apos;s music. Aside from those critiques this place is phenomenal."
4,Hyde Park needed a ramen place and Strings gets the job done. I am no ramen aficionado but as a vegetarian I found the hell ramen tasty and satisfying. However my girlfriend who had the Miso ramen found it a little bland and thought they could have added more components. The dumplings that we ordered were also a little cold in the center. The service was quick and friendly. Will probably be going back when I need my ramen fix. Happy Hyde Park has it. Also this place is BYOB so feel free to bring your own wine or beer.
5,Fan of the Chinatown location. Couldn&apos;t be happier that they opened a location here. I had the Tonkotsu w/pork belly. Very good. I recommend trying the drink &quot;stringria&quot;.
